oh	COMMA
I	O
can't	O
remember	O
what	COMMA
C	O
but	O
the	O
basic	O
idea	COMMA
it	O
was	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
how	O
can	O
we	O
maximize	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
back	O
from	O

that	O
we	O
are	O
putting	O
into	O

C	O
and	COMMA

was	O
really	O
quite	O
amazing	COMMA
he	O
says	COMMA

the	O
conclusion	COMMA
plastics	O
is	O
actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
in	O
landfills	O
cause	O
it's	COMMA
it's	O
low	O
weight	COMMA
but	O
it's	O
high	O
volume	O
so	O
it	O

there's	O
almost	O
no	O
energy	COMMA
there's	O

in	O
actually	O
doing	O
a	O

C	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O

it	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
burn	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	COMMA
produce	O
electricity	PERIOD
C	O
So	O
his	O
solution	O
was	O
to	O
burn	O
plastic	PERIOD
Collect	O
it	O
and	O
burn	O
it	PERIOD
Yeah	PERIOD
C	O
And	O
it's	O

is	O
more	O
energy	O
