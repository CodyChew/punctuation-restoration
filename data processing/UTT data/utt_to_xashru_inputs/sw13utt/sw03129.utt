Tom	COMMA
just	O
tonight	COMMA
I	O
was	O
working	O
on	O
my	O
car	O
out	O
of	O
necessity	COMMA
and	O
I	O
had	COMMA
uh	COMMA
uh	COMMA
had	O
a	O
long	O
ageold	O
problem	O
of	O
my	O
bright	O
lights	O
not	O
working	COMMA
uh	COMMA
this	O
is	O
the	O
type	O
of	COMMA
uh	COMMA
switch	O
where	O
you	O
flip	O
the	COMMA
the	O
lever	COMMA
the	O
turn	O
signal	O
on	O
the	O
column	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
would	COMMA
uh	COMMA
put	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
bright	O
light	O
position	O
the	O
lights	O
would	O
go	O
out	O
completely	COMMA
which	O
is	O
even	O
worse	O
than	O
them	O
just	O
not	O
getting	O
bright	O
<laughter>	PERIOD
And	O
I	O
had	O
presumed	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
switch	COMMA
and	COMMA
uh	COMMA
this	O
is	COMMA
uh	COMMA
an	O
older	O
car	COMMA
it's	O
a	O
seventytwo	O
M	O
G	COMMA
so	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
mail	O
order	O
the	O
part	COMMA
uh	COMMA
which	O
I	O
had	O
done	COMMA
and	O
tonight	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
and	COMMA
uh	COMMA
at	O
least	O
hooked	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
part	COMMA
only	O
to	O
discover	O
that	O
that	O
apparently	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
problem	COMMA
it's	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
switch	COMMA
because	O
it	O
does	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
switch	PERIOD
So	O
I'll	O
be	O
faced	O

having	O
to	O
return	O
that	O

uh	COMMA
hoping	O
that	COMMA
uh	COMMA
you	O
know	COMMA

Uh	COMMA
I	O
had	O
done	O

I	O
did	O
have	O

the	O

uh	COMMA
pretty	O

that	O
had	O

I've	O
not	COMMA

it	COMMA
the	O
