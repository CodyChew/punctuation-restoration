F Uh, I have a Ford pickup C and, F uh, the family car is a, F uh, a Dodge Caravan. C And, F uh, C because we have three kids and they're under thirteen <sniffing> C so, F uh they sort of fit our requirement. Yeah, I have a, one of those, F uh, pickups with the, F uh, seat with a seat in the back. C And so they just fit in there. When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work. Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room C and, F uh C and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back C and I kind of like having a pickup truck. D Actually, I think of it as a <throat_clearing>, as a car that'll last <laughter>. I like the way trucks are built C and I don't care about comfort. C So, I'm pretty happy. C So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one. I, I never buy new C so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck. <Throat_clearing> C And, F uh, yeah, I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz. I'll let somebody else, F uh, have the showroom shine C and I'll pay for the rest of it. Right. C And, F uh, the van we're sor, we might go again on a, on a van. We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time. I'm not sure. We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years C but, F uh, I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon <Throat_clearing> C and we were real happy with that because, F uh, my, my second requirement after price is, F uh, low maintenance. C And, F uh, th, it certainly had that. We didn't do much to it at all. D So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhoh. How, at how at how many miles? Huh. You didn't overheat it? Uhhuh. Huh. D Well that was,, Uhhuh. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. I have one colleague that, F uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining C and, F uh, F uh, he's a, it's, he's pretty conservative guy. I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, F uh, I'm sure he does, yeah. <Throat_clearing>. <Laughter>. No <throat_clearing>. Yeah. F Uh. Yeah <throat_clearing>. Right. . If I only had some place that I could store the, F uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time. I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty. C But, F uh, they're solid. F Uh, trucks are built, F uh, E I mean, <Throat_clearing> They're the only things Americans still know how to build C and, F uh <throat_clearing>. Yeah. Right. I I kind of like mine, yeah, C so, mine's a Ford <throat_clearing>. F Oh, I heard about that, yes. Yeah. That, that's a serious truck. Right, this, F uh, I, I know a contractor who just got one of those. He's pleased with it. I don't know what you drive now. E I mean, what do you drive now? F Oh, okay. Throw them in the back. Cab. F Oh, yeah? Yeah <laughter>. There you go. Yeah, yo, Right, yeah, I know. Yeah, you're looking at, I got a Toyota Four Runner. I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too, C so I got a Four Runner. <Laughter> You're just like me. I've never bought a new vehicle in my life. No. <Laughter> Let somebody else break it in, right <noise>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, my, my, pretty much the same. I, I got a, D like I D say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners C and, F uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to. E I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds C so I can tow everything C and it, I can throw, I've had eleven people in it before <laughter>. Believe it or not. C And, F uh, it's real reliable, belie, E I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now C and up until, F oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything <laughter> wrong with it. C And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided, I don't know, it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world, C but it blew a head gasket. Didn't do any damage to it. F Uh, I caught it real early. F Uh, F oh ninetyseven thousand. C So it's not real early <laughter>. No. Never overheated it. I smell, I smelled the, F uh, I smelled the coolant <sniffing>. Went out and looked. Saw it was, saw where it was coming from. Drove it right to the shop <laughter> and left it off. C And that was it C because I, d, I have that C and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, D actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining. <Laughter> E I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle. It, it's a <noise>, I don't know, people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves <laughter>. I know C but I bet you he really enjoys riding it. Yeah. C So, D you know, yo, h, <noise> when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving? Yeah. C And I go out twice a week on the bike, D so. At least. Just for the enjoyment. C But, yeah, E I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car E or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car, F uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, ju, just an open bed to throw stuff in. I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very, E I mean you got one. It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back C and, Right. To have it out of the way. Right. I think they last a lot longer than anything else. Yeah, yeah, the trucks do. F Uh, even though, D you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too. C But so are the, though I think the Chevies, I don't think the Che, I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords. I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer. At least until recently <laughter>. A friend of mine just bought, bought D like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck. E I mean, I don't like Dodges at all C but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, F uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it. F Oh, it's beautiful. That thing, that thing will last forever E I mean, F Oh, yeah, that thing's, F uh, it's got a boat engine in it <laughter>. Uhhuh.
