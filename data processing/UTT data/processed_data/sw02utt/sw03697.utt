Okay, D now then you heard the question, what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs? Okay. F Um. D Well. <Laughter> Is that the reason you're not doing it, C or are you so busy you don't have time to do it? F Uh. Okay. D Well being a female and being alone, you, I don't do anything but put gasoline, in my car, and let someone else check the oil even. C But, F uh, have you had any major repairs recently? Oh. Okay. D Well, you should be, feel very fortunate. I had to have a transmission replaced in an eightysix automobile C and I'll declare, that's an expensive. Yes, uhhuh. <Laughter> Maybe I should have just traded the car in. F Oh, it just, D well, I have a very comfortable car C and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car. C So, F um, D anyway, I have a new transmission, C and I'm sure that any of them would have cost al, E or charged me almost the same amount. C But it hurts, it hurts real bad. No, I took it to an independent out in Garland. I had, F um, these people were recommended by a neighbor C and, D you know, that's the only thing, I am not a native of Dallas. C So that means I have to depend on, on trustworthy friends C and that's. D Anyway, it's fixed, it's running, C and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it. Uhhuh. F Oh, I know it. It certainly is frightening. What work are you in? Oh. Okay, okay. No. No, I have just retired from, F um, the Southwest Medical Center. D Yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car, C but they're all too busy. C So. I have to <laughter> do it the other way, C and that's find someone and pay them to do it. C So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year. F Oh, it could be, C but I don't much think so <laughter>. I'm, D well, we're starting out a new one, C so let's make it a good one. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Byebye. Uhhuh. D Well, I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than I do now. I do, F uh, I do the easy stuff now. I change oil, F uh, C and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, I, I'll change spark plugs C and I'll change, D you know, points and, D you, you know, do air filters, that kind of stuff. C But, F uh, I can't do as much as I used to, F um, I used to do a whole lot more, but not any more, they're just too weird to work on now. D Well, that's part of it yeah, part of it is, like you said, I don't have time. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, on this car I've got now, no, C but I had a van before, C and it was only two years old, C and it had transmission go out on it. C But fortunately that was covered under the warranty. F Um. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, sometimes it makes you wonder. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Did you take it to a dealership? Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Right. F Oh, gosh. It's going to run for a li, for a while yet. <Laughter>. F Uh, I, I work for T I. I, I work in the networking area. Do you work for T I? No, okay. Oh. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, yeah, I'm, I'm planning on it. F Oh, it can't be any worse than last year, that's for sure. <Laughter>. Yeah. That's true, that's true. Yeah, I'm going to try and plan on it. D All right, D well, I enjoyed the conversation. D All right, thank you. Byebye.
