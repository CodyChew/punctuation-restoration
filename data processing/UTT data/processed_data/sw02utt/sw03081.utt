Okay, D well, I, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party I, depending on the number of people, I might cook a, D like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish C and, F um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish, C and we usually serve fresh fruit and, F uh, then make a dessert. C So that makes, D Well, that sounds good. That sounds good. Bread, do you have bread to go with it? Gosh. F Oh, D well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds. I've heard, D you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on the cooking for lasagna, they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna. D So. Did you? D Well, I, I know people that have, have served it C and they say, D gosh, if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy, C and she said it's, they said it's good. C So, that, that's always sounds good to me, F um, I feel like, I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot. I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, F oh, not always for company, just for, just for family. C So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen. C But a time consuming place. Yeah, right, right, C so. I don't know, what that is. No I don't know what that is. Okay. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Do you like to make your own guacamole? Yeah, we, we don't make it very often, I guess, C but, F uh, F Oh do they? Gosh, Gosh, F Oh, that's good, that's good, C or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich. F Oh, D well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day, C and, C and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad. D Well, I don't know, I guess they don't have it at home, They must, they just said they never had it at home. C So I, I was concerned that, I thought, F oh, taking this, D you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, D gosh, D you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly, C so I just, F Oh, does that help? Okay, D well, D Well, I'll have to remember that. D Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top C and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would, C so. I thought maybe that was the trick. Yeah, yeah, C so. F Oh, D well. I guess we bought a lot of, we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef, C so even though, D you know, the ground turkey, it's, the meat is softer C and I, everybody seems to like it. C So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper, too, C so we often buy it we buy it, Yeah, yeah, C so we bought that C or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets, C and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them. C Or in, Yeah, yeah. Less cho, less cholesterol. Yeah, right, right. D Well, I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight. I always like dessert <laughter>. Right, right that's always good, Probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make A and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake, C and we take a recipe from my grandmother, D you know it's probably fairly typical, cream cheese and egg and sugar, and the insides of a, Uhhuh. F Oh, that sounds good. F Uh, we're not, F uh, real wealthy at the moment. Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna, C and I used my mother's recipe, I really like it. It's got, F um, you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it C and, I'm not sure she even puts, must be some Italian spices in there. I can't remember. C But, F um, for the cheese part, you mix, F uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese and, F uh, layer all that. It's good. C And, then, F uh, F uh, tossed salad and, and, F um, <<to someone in the room>> F Oh, my goodness, Diane, get down from there. <<back to phone>> C And, F uh, let's see, what else did I serve with that. Corn, yeah, I made French bread with that one too. I have a recipe that's <dishes> pretty good for that <noise>. C So. Yeah. I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once. It was good. Easy <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, I know. F Oh, yeah. Not my favorite place, but. A necessity <laughter>. Let's see, what else do we like to have for, trying to think what else I like to serve. My mother likes to serve taco grandes. Have you ever had, that? You take a flour tortilla C and you fry it like a taco shell C and you, F uh, for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, F um, tomato sauce in it, C and, C and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor C so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff. C And, then, F um, let's see, C and then, C and you heat up refried beans, C and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese, C and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first, then you put the meat, then you put the grated cheese, C and then you put, F um, let's see, what's next, then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the, F um, lettuce, C and you can put, F uh, D like guacamole and <<to someone in the room>> Katy, I'm on the phone. D Well, get a towel or go change. I'm on the phone. <<Back to phone.>> F Um, F oh a little sour cream is good and, and chopped olives, F Uh, yeah. No, I don't very often. Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain D so. Yeah. I just cut slices off C and. I like an avocado sandwich, too. Yeah, yeah. <<Spoken off phone>>. What you want. <<Back to phone>> wh, where do they get it? <Laughter>. I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to, I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe. Yeah. It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it. Yeah, if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it. That's supposed to help keep the, F um, keep it from turning brown so quick. Oh. F Oh, that's good. That probably helps, too. <<Off phone>> Do you want it? F Oh, yeah we have too, <<Off phone>> Do you want scrambled? Yeah. Yeah if you get it on sale, <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah I don't think mine know either. In fact, we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey, too. It costs less than the other, I don't know, there's supposed to be something more healthy about it <laughter>. Poultry instead of the beef and pork, yeah <laughter>. Yeah, I, I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve. F Um, One salad that we always like, my sisterinlaw always brings to family dinners, is a, I don't know what you call it. F Uh, you mix, F um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, F uh, D like Cool Whip that's good and quick and easy, Uhhuh.
