Okay, F uh, what do you think about, F uh, the idea of having volunteer service for everyone? . D Well, are you doing any kind of volunteer work now? What about, when, when would people do it, when they finished high school? I think particular boys that the maturity, in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school C and I think there's a, there's a real challenge there. There's also this, this issue of, of, F uh, D you know, whether you're really ready, C and I think it gives a different perspective. <Breathing>. The only complication is, is, is how do you fund something like this? Yeah, I think the Mormon church has, sends out missionaries that, That's, F uh, it's interesting. It gets them away from home and, and gets them to do something useful, although the kids today, though, it, it seems that almost that their concern for money, I, we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in, in trying to find a job, study something that will give them a job as opposed to, be curious, be curious as to if, if there was, if there was mandatory, you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary, do you think that would be reasonable? D Well, C but, the, the issue of, of, of, which, what, what would, what would you find, what would you have them do? D You know there are a lot of people around with, there's a lot of unemployment right now. What would you have these people do if they were brought in? D Well, yeah. C Or say, say the volunteer, say that, say that it was mandatory. Yes, my father was in the C C C. D Well, it seems that there's some things like the, F uh, the programs at least just go around and, and, and clean up streets and, and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things. Yeah, in fact, we, we helped with, F uh, F oh, Help To Help Humanities, C and that was a, that was a good experience, C but you take the kids out C and <breathing>, C and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that, that C either need demolishing, or need fixing up, C so it would be a good idea. F Uh, we've been doing this three or four minutes. I think that, F uh, do you have any other further comments? D Well, it was good talking to you, Betty. Have a good night. <Children> F Uh, I think that, F uh, really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service. F Uh, C and, D you know, E I mean, there have been so many people that have done it C and I've talked with several C and I think they've gotten a lot out of it. Not right now, C but I have done, F uh, Red Clo, Cross work C and, F uh, I've taught C P R training a, I think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, i, if they go straight into college I think they're going in too quick C but, Right, F uh, y, I, I think if you've been out of school a year, year and a half, before you start to college, you appreciate college more, than someone that just goes right straight into college. <Breathing> D Well, a lot of parents fund their children. There are, F uh, some groups that have their children, D you know, go away for a year. Even the religious organizations. Right. C And the parents fund them for the whole year, year and a half that they're gone. I think it would. In, in Israel, the, even the women are, are required to, to be in the military for a certain period of time. F Uh, I was in the military, C and I personally feel if, if they have draf, the draft, that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men. What, into the service? C Or, D Well I, I, I think that they ought to have something for the, the unemployed in a voluntary field like the, F uh, I don't know if you know, remember about the W P A, He was in that? E I mean, D you know, F uh, it's not the best thing in the world, C but, F uh, it gave them something to do. R, or go into the, the more depressed areas and help repair the houses. Uhhuh. No, not really. O, okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
