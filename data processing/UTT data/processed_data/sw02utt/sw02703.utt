Okay <static>. F Um, D well, I'm not, E I mean, I read a lot, C but I don't, I don't read a whole, E I mean, <<stutters>> F uh, F eh, F eh, F eh, I, I, I, I tend to read D like only out of a couple, D you know, groups. F Uh, C and I'm, a, F uh, I'm a big baseball fan, C so I tend to read a lot of the baseball books C and, F Oh, okay. C And, F uh, I read a lot of science fiction. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<pause>>. Yeah, I, F um, I don't really, I pro, <laughter> probably should. I don't really read the selfimprovement books or things like that. I, F uh, F um, I'll get D like, F uh, books on history and stuff like that that look interesting. C And I, F uh, of course, I don't ever get around to reading them <laughter>. D You know, I got, F uh, F um, I b, I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club. C And I'll get, get stuff out of that. D Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, D you know, D like a couple of years ago. C And I started reading, and got about sixty pages into it C and it's like eight hundred pages <laughter>. C And it was like, F uh, I want to read something else for a while <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, especially, D you know, D well, BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off, D you know, in the eighteen forties, D you know. C And it's D like, wait, the war wasn't until the eightee, D you know. It's D like, okay, C and I realize these things, D you know. These things take awhile D like to move up, C but it's, D you know, it's hard sometimes. I read a lot of science fiction. Yeah. Yeah. That, C and I, I do the same thing. I, Yeah. F Uh, there's one science fiction writer named, F uh, Allen Dean Foster. F Oh, okay, yeah. He, F um, I must have D like fifty or sixty books by him <laughter>. E I mean, I have, D you know, I have everything he's ever D well, almost everything he's ever done. C And, F um, D you know, I, I know that when I, D you know, when I get his book I'm, I'm usually going to enjoy it. F Um, C so it's really, D you know, it's, it's fun to, to do that. F Uh, Yeah. D Well, he does a lot of D like, F um, F uh, movie adaptations and things like that. Yeah. C And, F uh, his adaptations are usually really good. F Um, it's, it's funny he, F um, the, the novelization of STAR WARS was list, D you know, it, it was out in the, F uh, in the stores as being by George Lucas. C But it turns out that, F uh, Foster actually, F uh, ghost wrote it for him. Wh, which, D you know, when I read it, I should have realized that because, E I mean, it had Foster's style written all over it <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, I'm sure he does <laughter>. I'd hope so. D Well, I mean he's doing all right, probably <laughter>. Yeah. That's true. D Well, yeah. You, you're a baseball fan, you're, you're aware of that kind of thing <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. I had a, F uh, had a subscription to that last year, C but I'm, F uh, I'm mostly a baseball fan. C So I'm, I'm not, as inter, D you know, the other stuff is interesting C but, F um, I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff. F Uh, D actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything. Yeah. F Um, C but, F uh, I, I, I do like the Orioles also. Yeah <<faint>>. Toledo. I was in Toledo last summer. Went to a, F uh, to a Mud Hens double header <laughter>. Yeah. Y. I saved that issue, D actually. F Um, that's when I had the subscription. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. They don't exist anymore, I don't, think. At least not by that name. There's the Iowa Cubs, C but I don't know if they play, in the same location. F Um. I, minor league, baseball, I think <laughter> is a lot more fun than, major league baseball. C And it's a lot cheaper <laughter>. Yeah. There's, F um, there's a city just west of Freder, of, F uh Baltimore, called Frederick. It's about forty miles west. C And they have a minor league team. C And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles C and, F um, I, it's just a lot of fun. E I mean, it's free parking C and three bu, bu, D you know, four bucks now to get in. C And, D you know, the hot dogs are a dollar C and, C and it's just great. Oriole game? If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium, it's four bucks. The ticket, the ch, the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty. Yeah. C And, F um, hot dogs D like start at a dollar fifty <laughter>. F Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well how much are the box seats there? Do you know offhand? Yeah. That's, F um, that's a little steeper. I think the, F uh, most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks. C But we're getting a new stadium next year C so, Yeah, it'll go up. C And, if it opens <laughter>. It's, F uh, something we're really irritated about around here. C Or some people are really irritated about. They're, they're building this new sta, they built the new stadium downtown. C And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium. C But I park for free up at, at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free <laughter>. C And, F um, I'm not going to be able to do that downtown <laughter>. Yeah. We, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Weren't you guys, supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas? F Oh, it d, it didn't, go through. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's, that's what I'd always heard, I've, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial. F Um, it's actu, it actually funny that, F um, I live just outside of Baltimore. C And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick, but as it does to go to the, the ballpark in Me, in, F uh, Baltimore. Because, F um, to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate C and, C because I live just south of the Interstate. H, hop on the Interstate, C and the stadium's right off the Interstate <laughter>. C So, it's like I drive west C and I'm there. C And, D you know, C and then to go into Baltimore, E I mean, it D well, it's fewer miles, C but I've got to go, stop and go traffic and everything. Do you read, F um, I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED C but you don't read many sports books C or, Uhhuh. F Um. Huh. <Sniffing>. There was, F uh, I understand there was a really good basketball b, book called, F uh, A SEASON ON THE BRINK. Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know. <<pause>> I'm trying to think of the guy's name. It was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it. I just heard about it the other night. F Uh, I was listening to something on the radio about, F uh, D you know, a talk show about sports books, C and they, C and they mentioned that one. Yeah. C And, F uh, I was thinking about, there was a, I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A, which, Yeah. I get in to, even when I don't like the sport so much, <<sound fading>> I get interested in the history of sports franchises <hiss or static>, Okay <static>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I'm a big baseball fan too. <Laughter>. E, D well, I like, I teach school, C and so during the school year, I just don't have time to read. C And I, D you know, I would love to, to be able to read more because I, I enjoy it so much. C But with correcting papers and, and I, two o, kids of my own, I just don't have time. C But in the summer, I try to read a lot. C And, C and, of course, being a woman, I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot. I just, I really enjoy that because it's kind of a, a getaway type thing. C So I, I read a lot of that. C But I also love sports. C And, F uh, F uh, I, I don't have time to read in, C but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED i, during the, the year because my son gets that. C And, F uh, C but, F uh, I don't read a lot of nonfiction, C and I really should because there's so many selfimprovement books out right now that would, would be, benefit me greatly, C but I just don't. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, do you? Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. Yeah. It's, i, some of those books are real tough to get into, C but after you get into them, they're really good. C But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so. Yeah. It's right, that's right. I find though, that if, when I find an author, F uh, C and you don't read a lot of fiction, you said. C But when I find, Do you? When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. Because you, you get used to their style and you really enjoy it. Uhhuh. I've heard of him. Is that right? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books <laughter> about science fiction? I think that's unbelievable. F Oh, does he really? Oh <<faintly>>. Is that right? Is that right? Uhhuh. D Well, I, I've never read anything of his, C but I've heard about him. C But wouldn't you think he would, does he get some royalties from that, hopefully? D Well, I would think he would <laughter>. F Oh, I'm sure he is, I'm sure he is. C But sometimes the more you get the more you want too, C so, Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, right, right, <laughter> right. I, in fact, I'm a sports fan, period. We, E I mean, th, that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much C because there's everything in it. Oh. D So you're probably, F uh, a Baltimore fan, right, an Oriole fan? Is that right? Boston? F Oh, D well, that's good too. I'm, I'm sure you do. D Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here. C But I, I was, F uh, I'm not from here. I'm originally from Ohio, C so I've always followed the Tigers. Because, D you know, I was, I was born and raised in Toledo. Yeah. F Oh, I love the Mud Hens <laughter>. They're great. I love the name C and, there was a b, really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year. Did you? . Yeah. I li, I really enjoy that team. I, we used to go there all the time. I used to live in Iowa too, C and they have the Iowa Oaks. C And we used to go, <laughter> go to their games all the time. C And, I know, I know they don't. F Oh, they must, they must have changed then. Because it used, D well I haven't lived there for l, I've been here for like twelve years now, C so. C And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time. C But we used to always go to their games, C and it was kind of fun. It's almost, F uh, more fun than going to a major league game. I don't know, I just really enjoy the, farm teams. Yes, it is. It's not quite so serious, D you know. That's for sure, that's, for sure. Is that right? Is that right? D Well, how, D like how much is an Oriole game? F Oh, gosh. D See, it's higher than the Rangers. F Oh, yeah. A, the food here is outrageous. C But, F uh, you can get a good seat for, F uh, D well it used to be three dollars. C But I think it's gone up to fo, four dollars this year. C But, D you know, it's in the bleachers, way out in the, D you know, in center field, C but it's still nice. You still can see well. C And, F uh, we usually sit there unless somebody gives <laughter> us tickets, D you know, box seats C or something, then we usually sit out there. Box seats run from, F oh, like eight dollars to twelve dollars. F Oh, C so it'll go up. Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh. F Uh, that's, D yeah, that's a bummer. D Well, D see, baseball here though is the cheapest game in town. Because the Cowboys, it's out, it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game. C And the Mavericks are t, it's high too. C So baseball's cheap, compared to other games. D Well, that didn't go s, over, now. They, they, they decided, D you know, George Bush, who, who's the main owner of the Rangers, decided that, F uh, they'd stay in Arlington. C So Arlington's going to build a stadium, a bigger one. C So we're going to, they're going to stay there. Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer. C And, C and that was their main, main money making, D you know, deal for the city. C And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away. Because everything, there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet 'n Wild C and, C and it, D you know, that's, all the tourists come there. C And, C and they, it would have been devastated, they would have collapsed. C So I'm kind of glad they're staying there. Because it's right in the middle of Fort WorthDallas, C and, D you know, Yeah. We, D you know, we, I like it there. C And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything <laughter>. C So, I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington. C And it's takes us maybe, F uh, D we, D well, thirtyfive to forty minutes to get there from Plano, which is not too bad at all. Yeah. D So, Is that right? Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, not really. D Now my son does, I have, I have a son that just turned sixteen, C and he reads everything he gets, he gets his, get his hands on. He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan. He's a basketball fan because he, he plays for the high school he goes to C and F uh, just loves D, Dick Vitelle, <laughter> which not many people do. C So, C but he's reading it, <sigh> C and he's r, C and he says, He's so interesting, Mom. You just can't believe all the things he's done. C And he's really enjoying that. C And I, C and he said, Mom, you need to read it after I get finished. C So maybe I will. I never heard that one. Uhhuh. Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'll have to tell my son about that. I'm sure he'd like it. F Oh, that would be good <hiss C or static>.
