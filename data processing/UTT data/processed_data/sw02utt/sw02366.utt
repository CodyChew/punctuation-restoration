I don't know. I grew up, F uh, in the, the sixties, C and at that time, F uh, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess C and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and, and thereafter C but have since, F uh, I grew up in a small town in, in southern Oklahoma I have kind of gone back to, F uh, more of a county, F uh, flavor in music. F Um, I'm not quite sure why that is C and it seems like almost a opposite, C but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, F uh, sounding music. It didn't have what, D you know, I guess what I was looking for at the time country tell's more of a, a story. It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up C and I've, I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years. Yeah, that was my teenage years. I was born in fifty C and, C and, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of the way I am. Uhhuh. It is, it's got, F uh, basically an easy, F uh, rhythm and, and tone. C And it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to F uh, F uh, something to fall into. I'm kind of the say way, I, I've gone through different periods of life, F uh, in music from pop to classical. I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I, I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there, C and suppor, was support, I was influenced by all different kinds of music C but basically because that's where I worked. C And I've developed a real love for, F uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, F uh, heavy into classical type music. He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music, F uh, that they were using behind them because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, F uh, behind the cartoons C and so consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there C and I think that, F uh, got deep seated into me. One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, F uh, are those that call on those classical, F uh, roots, I guess, F uh, Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole <laughter> lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about, C but he does have some things. Chicago had some things, F uh, C and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some, some real, F um, influences by classical music C and I'm still, still, my favorite, in fact most of my C D s are classical music. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of thinking that's maybe, our generation was, F uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, F uh, things now with the music that's behinds them. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's their signal. Yeah. When did you first take your, F uh, first piano lesson? Yeah. Yeah. It is a time consumer. Yeah. Right. <Laughter>. No, it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it. I was never able to, to master all that. In fact my brother and sister both, they were, F oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went through the, F uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing, C and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again, they sold the piano, C and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to, C so I, that's one of things I felt like I missed in life C and I, I really, in fact, F uh, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, F uh, piano. I just, D you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that, maybe one of these days, I'll, D you know, I'm kind of like you, maybe one of these days I'll get around to it, I'll do something with the piano, C but probably not. Just never got a chance to come out. No. D Well, it's a pleasure talking with you. Best, of luck in your graduate school. Goodbye. When you say that you grew up, F uh, in the sixties I take it that was the, F uh, teenage type years C or, F uh, Okay, we, we're very similarly aged, C so we probably have an in, interesting perspective on the music on the times, C so I'm just a couple years older than you, F um, essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music, C but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me, F uh, <lipsmack> my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college C and I became attached to that style of, F uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing, I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, F uh, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, F uh, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it. F Uh, over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical C and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it, it very relaxing for me. My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, F uh, Simon, it's something that interests me, F uh, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned. C And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music. I'm not a music, F um, , I'm not particularly schooled in it. I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music. C And I, I spent a good deal of time listening also to, F uh, <lipsmack> people from the late seventies, D really, F um, <lipsmack> Neil Diamond, for instance. F Um, people of, of that particular time, I listen to some country and western C but I'm not sch, schooled in it C and I, I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it. I played a little bit of piano. I continue to do that. I want to do it C and I never have the discipline to stay with it, C but when I do play, F uh, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for a new piano player. Right. Right. I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music. I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation. F Uh, a good example would be, F uh, I have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations, F uh, C and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH C and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY C and both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows, F uh, C and I, I've, F uh, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested, C but it's the music, almost that I find myself listening to, F uh, That could well be. I, I, F uh, <lipsmack> spent my junior year, F uh, E and sophomore and junior year in, in college when I, a song by the, F uh, F uh, I think the title of it was just Downtown, F uh, C and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da, F uh, all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work, F uh, C and my family now knows if they come into my study and, F uh, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, F uh, at school, F uh, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away, <Laughter>. They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it, that's right. F Uh, probably about first grade, C and I have, F uh, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it. I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes C and then inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things, F uh, It is. In order to continue to, to grow and I, I always think that I'll be able to do it C and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted, in composition themes C and I, keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them. I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved, F uh, C but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude <breathing> C and I keep thinking, D gee, I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand C but, C but it doesn't for me. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh,, C So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, F uh, That's the most fascinating thing <laughter>. C And you, sir, take care. Okay. Goodbye.
