Okay. F Uh, generally I get, F uh, D you know, most of my news, F uh, in the, D you know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, and, F uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With, with occasional smatterings of, of, F uh, D you know, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper. C But, F uh, my, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to, to look at the articles every day and, and go through a paper, D you know, exhaust the details. C So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. D Well, yes. I, I, D well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article. C And, C and so I, I, I like the weekly magazines, F uh, because i, it gives me, D you know, the high points of what's going on. F Uh, C but many times, F uh, <sigh> D you know, the, the local, F uh, the local news kind of suffers, D you know. C But here I am, D you know, cheek by jowl with our nation's capital <laughter> C and, Yeah. Yes. E, exactly. D Well, when, when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the beltway <laughter>. C But, F uh, i, it turns out that, F uh, that, that the C N N is, I think, is great. And for, for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events C but generally, they're, they're, they're more sound bitish, D you know, kind of thing C and, C and I don't really, F uh, D you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, F uh, D you know, dose of news that way. Uhhuh. Yes. D Well the MERCURY and the, and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really, can stand up there. F Uh, Redwood City. I use to work at Anteks. Anteks, Amdahl and places like that. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. I, I've, I enjoy, D see they have, F uh, we have two, the, both C SPANS here. C But, C but really, the, th, on the public T V, D you know, MACNEIL LEHRER is one, is an hour's program that I always, if, if I watch any news program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And, and occasionally C SPAN. I, I like a, I saw the, F uh, the, F uh, the, the tapes that were, that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust was, the whole thing was, was run on that C and C and, C and a, also, they have the, F uh, the, F uh, F uh, PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. It, when, wh, when it first, F uh, D you know, when it first tuned in on that I, D you know, it's one that's, <whistling> I think it was, somebody was just scarcely just, just ripping the hell out of someo, another person. C And I, C and everybody was, D you know, making noise in the background. C And then, Yeah. Here's this dude in a wig C and I said to myself, it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about <laughter>. C And then, C and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench C and I said F oh, it's Parliament <laughter>. Yeah. C So I, I thought to myself, I can't wait. I'm going over to, to Britain in mid, D you know, in midMay. I, I, I'm going to, F uh, D you know, a, D you know, apr, approach my, F uh, D you know, this is how I discovered, D you know, the que, the Prime Minister's, D you know, question and answer period, D you know. P, Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, that's right. You're very close actually. It's almost a, F uh, bedroom community for the capital. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Clinking>. Yeah. A lot of my information comes from several sources. Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. F Uh, which I like. F Uh, I, I think it's fairly objective C and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative. C And while there's an inherent, F uh, filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read, F uh, I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of, F uh, favoring the other side. That's, that's potential indication of balance. C And, generally, I really do believe they are pretty balanced. F Uh, I also read TIME magazine C and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the, F uh, various, F uh, of the articles and the front section C and, F uh, Oh. F Oh, you st, <laughter> did you use to live around here? F Oh, okay. F Oh, yeah, okay. I know exactly where that is. Yeah, we, we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper <clink>. A, the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times, i, at, D well the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a, F uh <clinking> a very good quality <clinking>, F uh, newspaper C and I like a lot of the articles there. Th, the other thing when you said, A we don't have cable T V, so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is, is called C SPAN. Both? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> F Oh, I never say that. *listen That would have been interesting. Yeah. I, I think that's always fascinating. I wish, I wish we had something. <Snorting>. C But it's usually the Prime Minister, right? Thatcher, Major. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Which could be another of Monty Python. I, I have seen that C and, F uh, a, aside from the level of wit which is much higher than, generally, in American politics, F uh, which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I think. C And it's unlike the fairly controlled, F uh, press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they, they always seem,
