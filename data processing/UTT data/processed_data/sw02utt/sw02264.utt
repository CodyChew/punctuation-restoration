D Well, since you live close, I don't know if you know, F um, about what Louisville is doing with recycling, C or are you familiar with any of that? Huhuh. Yeah. D You know, I read, D you know, when they first started doing that in the paper, and I read about that, I was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time. C And, D you know, we separate everything out, and then have to haul it up to a Metco, D you know, which is a real pain. C So if they would come up, curbside recycling, D Well, D now have they moved them behind WalMart? F Oh, God. Oh. That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing. Because to take it to a Metco, you have to take it when they're open, D you know, which is always a real pain. C And so when that thing came up in WalMart parking lot, we thought, F oh, this is great. C And we started taking them up there. C And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, D you know <laughter>. I didn't know. C And we're going, F oh, no, there goes our recycling place. That's really nice to find out that it's behind there <laughter>. D Well, we pretty much do, F um, plastic milk cartons and, F um, F um, F um, newspapers. I couldn't even think of what you call them. Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do. Yeah. Yeah. C And D really, that's about, that's really about it. Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of? F Oh, really. I know. I know. I know. We're kind of the same way. D You know, at first, D you know, you, at first it was a real, it was a real hassle, C and I'm wondering are we really going to do this, C but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, D you know, where it becomes, is automatic, D now, to throw, different things in different places, D you know. C So I just go, D you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen C and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there, D you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, D you know, if we get them, C so. F Oh, they do, too. C And they're impossible to crush. E I mean, you can't get the down to any size, D you know. If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, D you know <laughter> pretty easily, C so. D You know, F Oh, really. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, that will be good. Sure. Let somebody get something out of it. Yeah <laughter>. Haha <laughter>. D Well, I was kind of hoping with, D you know, do you work for T I? No. Yeah. There was a, T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs. C And, D you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, F uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here C and there was crushers out in all of the hallways D you know, C and that's, they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program. It's, D you know, T I doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that. C And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, D you know, C And I'm kind of like, yeah. I shall, they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, D you know. That was going to use it for good, C so, Sounds like you have a little one just like I do <laughter>. Yeah. Mine was two in December <laughter>. D Well, it was good to talk to you. F Oh, do they really. Curbside pick up? I really hope they do that in Louisville. It would make it a lot easier on all of us. Talk to you later. Byebye. D Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, D like the area in there, I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there. Huhuh. they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, D like behind WalMart, that take some things. Yeah. C Because I finally asked because, D you know, we had all of those milk cartons C and there was nowhere else to take them C and they had it in front of WalMart C and I ask in WalMart C and they said they moved it just behind. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Like aluminum cans? That's about what we do too. D Well, I guess, F um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything. F Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, D you know, I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Those milk cartons take up so much room. <Laughter>. I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago. We were using baby food C and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it. Some of our neighbors were doing it C and so, D you know, when I found out some places to take it, C and, F um, D like, F um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, C and I know that they're going to use, D you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff C so, D you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, D you know. Yeah. That's true. C And they won't raise our taxes. Yeah. <Laughter>. No, I don't. I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm, Yeah. <<Speaker is talking to someone in background>>. Sorry. She'll be two in July. Oh. D Well, it was nice to talk to you. I know they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives. They pick up newspapers, I think. Yeah. <Baby>. Okay.
