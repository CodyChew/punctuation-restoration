D Well, this is the season for vacations. C And, F uh, I guess for places I like to go, I enjoy going to the beach and having, having outdoor, being outdoors somewhere. Someplace that's very different than Texas. C And I, as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot. And being able to be outside, enjoy outsor, outside activities, C so. Enjoy going places where, I enjoy playing tennis, C so I like to have a tennis court there, C or, C or if it's at the beach, the beach is great. A pool is great. C And, I, F Oh, D well, let's see, we have plans this year to drive up to the, F uh, to Colorado. C And, we will be going to Estes Park, and Colorado Springs, C so. One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado, into Durango and north of the area there. C And I, boy that's a nice, a nice place to visit. It's really nice at, there's a nice, nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining. C And, F uh, C and then D actually, north, north of that is another town and, a smaller, on a smaller scale, I guess, than Silverton. C But, I, C and then there's lots and lots of real, of mountains that are covered with, F uh, boulders. C So, I guess people Jeep through that area C and we did not have a chance to do that. C But, I sure would like to go back there and do that again. I have not been, C but I have heard it's wonderful. Right. Right, C and the, beach is nice, the beach is really nice, isn't it. Oh. Sea shells. Sea shells. Yeah. F Oh, where do you stay? My husband always wants to go to Destin, we just have not gone that direction yet. Okay. Right. F Oh. <laughter> That's nice. Great. F Oh, nice. Oh. Great. Oh. D Well, we have just we have just, Are you driving? Oh. D Well, we are, the neighborhood that we live, they are switching to an alternate calendar this year, C so it, starting, D well, starting at the end of July, we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March. C So that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family. C So, I, D Well, it's, what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation, nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation. C And, F uh, in, C and in the summer would be more like a two month, two month break. C So, C and they hope to boost the, they hope to boost the learning of the children. Just the retention of the material for them. C So, F uh, Yeah, yeah. C So, <noise> it's <noise> C so, D anyway, C so maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls <laughter>. We will head for, we will head for Florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer. D So, F uh. D Well, that's probably ne, all we need to do today. Alright. Thanks a lot. Right. Yeah. Where, where do you usually go? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. We are, F uh, we have not had a vacation in several years, C so, <throat_clearing> be our first chance in awhile, F uh, we are going to go to, F uh, Destin, Florida, which is a very nice beach area, if you are not familiar with it. F Oh, it's, it's gorgeous. F Uh, we used to go quite a bit, F uh, before I moved out here. We were closer and, F uh, used to go almost every summer, F uh, and, rent a condo there on the beach. F Uh, there's quite a few, F uh, there's a lot of development of, of condominiums there on the beach front. C And, F uh, <noise> C so they have, F uh, they are very, very large condos. C And, they have quite a few rooms, C and, F uh, C so we, we will usually rent one for about a week or so. C And, go down. Oh. Yes, it's, F uh, it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, and a, lot of nice waves usually, F uh, enough, enough to make it. I am sorry. F Uh, there's not as many sea shells along there, F uh, that's the only thing that they really do not, they have some, but not, not so much. F Um, if you go further down, F uh, you will usually find some, but not right in there. F Uh, I do not know why it is, C but, F uh, it just, it seems not, it seems not to have as many there, right there. C But, F uh, we, we enjoy it, F uh, it's, the place where we stay is, we usually stay at the same place every year, C and <throat_clearing> they are, like I say right on the beach. C So, It's a place called Jetty East, F uh, J E T T Y E A S T, C and it's, F uh, called that because it's at the very end of, F uh, a jetty there, which is, F uh, sort of at the end of this little, little point C and, F uh, it's a, at the very end, it's the last set of condominiums there, C and it's, F uh, it's very nice. F Uh, it's not very expensive, F uh, you can, I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids. C And, F uh, they have a, we have a, F uh, I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, F uh, condominium, which will sleep, <inhaling> I do not know, quite a few about, six or eight. C And, F uh, cause it's got, D you know, pull out couches and all that, C and, F uh, I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three hundred dollars for the week. Yeah, it really is, C because, F uh, the, F uh, D you know, it has got its own kitchen, full size, kitchen and everything. C And, this one, I think has two baths, C and it's, the one we got is on the, on the beach side. C So, We have got a beautiful view and balcony, C and, F uh, just, D you know, it's really a nice stay. F Uh, in fact, we stayed there on our honeymoon, we, I had won a trip to the Bahamas, but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time, C so we instead went there, F uh, and loved it just as much as, as if we had gone to the Bahamas. We, in fact, we stayed an extra day or so, because we liked the, F uh, the particular ro, F uh, F uh, F uh, suite we had gotten was very nice C and, so we decided to stay. C But, F uh, it's a pretty nice place, you will need to try to go and, stay there sometime. It's a little far from here, C but, F uh, Yeah, we are. We are, it will take, F uh, a day and a half to get there, probably. C So. Uhhuh. F Uh, what does, what does that mean, alternate? Oh. Uhhuh. Right. I see. Kind of scattering the vacation out, throughout the year. Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. Okay. So long. Byebye.
