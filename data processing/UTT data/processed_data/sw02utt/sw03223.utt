D Well, I almost forgot the topic, I was waiting so long for, F uh, for it to find somebody. F Um, Right, D well, D so what is your favorite T V show? F Oh, you like that one? Uhhuh. F Uh, I've never really watched that one. D You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows C and, F uh, D you know, there's, so there's only a few that I, that I like to watch routinely. Probably my favorite is, F um, F oh, D well, I like shows like GROWING PAINS C and, F uh, what's the other one now, they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night, C so I don't get to watch it very much. WONDER YEARS, yeah, that's my favorite. F Uh, Yeah. WONDER YEARS, I, I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever. I guess I can really relate to it, C and, F uh, it's just a real cute show <sniffing>. F Uh, I, I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, F uh, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess. Uhhuh. Yeah, Right, right. Uhhuh, yeah, my wife really likes that show, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D well, there was, C but there's a sense of ho, I guess, purity in the show, D like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS C but, F uh, D you know, Richie always used to be so, D you know, just so honest and pure I guess, C and when he left the show, D you know, that, it seemed to be missing that part of it C and I never did like it after that C so, I don't know, I, I say, see the same thing in D like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch. There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere. Yeah, uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So you're going to watch a game tonight? C So do you, do you have a favorite for the series or anything? F Oh, uhhuh. Yes. Yeah, he's a nice guy. I take it you live in the Dallas area. Do you live in the Dallas area? Uhhuh, yeah, I live in Garland, C and, yeah, I, I like Steve Bushel, C but I don't really like the Pirates. I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan C so, F uh, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all, they, D you know, they they've come from so far down, I really would like to see them do well. Yeah, one, one year they, maybe they'll make it, I don't know C so, C but, F uh, yeah, I like sports programming quite a bit, C but, F uh, I guess my, my favorite shows are the, C and, D you know, that getting back to the point that you made, that's really true, we were watching ROSEANNE, I guess, couple of weeks ago, C and her daughter was talking about birth control, D you know C and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time, C and, D you know, she's only seven years old, C so, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, D well that, that seems to be more our values, too, D like the WONDER YEARS, E I, I mean, it's kind of risque stuff for, maybe for teenagers, D you know, C or, C and you can kind of relate to it D you know, I don't know, that's, I enjoy that a lot C but, F uh, D you know, I agree with you, the, C and it's funny because the shows, D like a lot of them that used to be considered risque, like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff, I think they, they maintained, people would watch them because there was that, F uh, D you know, there was really the period that was going on there, E I mean, he really wasn't messing around with the girls, C but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff C but as soon as, D you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died C and it's, it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way, It's on your favorite T V shows and why. F Uh, MAJOR DAD. I, I love it, I think it promotes good family values, C and it's funny. That's ri, yeah. What kind do you like to watch? WONDER YEARS? I like both of those real much also. I, I think basically, they pr, same thing, they promote family values. <Inhaling> I do, too. I, I don't like it, F uh, lot of the shows that, that I've liked in the past, like, F uh, F oh, GOLDEN GIRLS C and, some of them tend to get so risque, C and when you have children F uh, watching it, that sometimes really starts to bother me C and, F uh, that's one of the reasons, E I mean, if you want to go all time favorite show, probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE yeah, which I just, I was, I always felt was wonderful F uh, C and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just, F um F uh, they, they go after, D well, they, like I said, the risque stuff, just I guess they think that's what people want to watch. Yes. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I agree. F Uh, do you like the sports programming? F Um, I, I enjoy those also, almost as, as much to a certain extent. I'm, our whole house is baseball fans C and, F uh, we enjoy that, C and, F uh F oh yeah, F oh, yeah <laughter>. F Uh, probably the Pirates, C but only because of Steve Bushel, I guess otherwise I really don't care that much, C but, F uh, D you know, I'm, I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him, C and, F uh, I'd like to see him do well, D like all the way to the bank I guess <laughter>. <Laughter>. Pardon? Live in, live in Plano. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, yeah, it's, F uh, C so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do <laughter>. <Laughter> Right. Uhhuh. D Well, it's, so many of them now, F um, D you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in, C and C and, F uh, D you know, I'm, D you know, I'm, I'm an adult C and I have adult tastes now, C but I don't need that F uh, I, I like things that, F uh, are, are wholesome, I guess. Uhhuh. Yes, yes. Uhhuh. Yeah.
