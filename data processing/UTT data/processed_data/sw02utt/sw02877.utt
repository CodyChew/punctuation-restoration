Do you have any pets now? Joey, th, the dog is Joey? The cat is, F Oh, my goodness. F Oh, my <laughter>. I beg your pardon. Oh. D Well did you all catch it, C or, F uh, Uhhuh. No, did, no did you catch the fish? Uhhuh, C and it's all alone in that aquarium. D Well at the present time I have two dogs. An English setter, D you know, that's the white dog with the feathers C and it has, F uh, yellow spots on it which they call, I think, F uh, liver spots. C And that's a male. C And I have a wonderful female lab, black lab. Quite a long time, F uh, probably five or six years C and unfortunately the black lab that's a female, it, tha, it's, it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had, an, i, when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro, F uh, problems limping and so forth C and, she has hip dysplasia. C And it's in that breed. C But now I think there are tests that can be conducted, F uh, to tell whether or not the puppies have the, have it. C But I think, I don't know, apparently they've been so in, D well I don't know inbred, or what, C but, D Well n, I'm not sure that's the situation, C but, it, F um, for those dogs that are registered C and if, if you should have one, F uh, that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it, F uh. Uhhuh, C but she's wonderful. F Um, D like ha, what are the what are the symptoms? Uhhuh. Yes. F Um. D Well, F uh, I have had just wonderful luck with this lab, F uh, when i, F uh, let's see, winter before last we would bring her in, and, F uh, when it was cold. C And she wouldn't, I, D you know, the next morning you want to take them out, C and she wouldn't, I couldn't get her up without p, picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds. F Um, until, if I allowed her to not get up on her own, it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon. D Anyway, I, F uh, met my son's, F uh, college roommate, is a vet C and he said, F um, let's give her some race horse shots. C And D you know in, I'm, I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this, but you, because you all the time, D you know, run into people with problems. D Anyway, that's when we lived in Oklahoma, C and, F uh, C so he gave this dog a series of, it's, they give it to race horses, F uh, to get rid of, F uh cartilage, C and it's called. D Anyway, it's a series of six shots, once a week, C and then I noticed after two shots she was, D Well I could have, C but I can't give a shot. I took her from Enid, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks. C And, F uh, after the, the second shot she was significantly better. Then I didn't notice any improvement till the, after the sixth one. C And ever since, C and he said, F uh, a booster, F uh, every year or two, E I mean, maybe every six months or, or something like that and when I notice in the winter, when it's worse, D you know, it's cold weather and so forth then I have, F uh, gotten a booster for her. C But not many people in this part of the country know anything about. I've had to get it from Oklahoma. They've heard about it C but they've really never used it. C So dogs that get down in the hips, D like I think German Shepherds do it, and probably large dogs. C And, F uh, it's just wonderful. F Uh. F Um, F um, D well we're living now in an area where we, we, we're in the woods C and we take walks. I just don't let them, F uh, F uh, go away from me, C but we take walks through the woods twice a day. C And, F uh, I can over do it on her. C But D anyway, at least she can go C and she's not limping along and all that. Tell me about your cat. C And is, F um, Stripper an inside cat, or outside? Uhhuh. Yes. D Well of course. <Laughter> That's nice, they, they, D Well he just can, D well he has been trained C and you've ke, you've kept u, it up, haven't you. Yeah, it is wonderful, I, I have some neighbors across the field, C and, F um, they when we first moved here, F uh, when the dogs and I didn't fe, we have a very nice kennel and everything C but, C but since I, I didn't want to, I, wa, I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while. C So I kept watch and never let them get away, C but D now every couple weeks, they wou, one would slip away C and my neighbor said to me, F oh, I noticed those dogs, dogs are so well trained, anytime they hear your voice, they come. C So that made me very proud <laughter>. D Well, have we been talking five minutes? I'm not either, C but, Yeah. D Well, F um, D so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure. Yes. F Oh really, uhhuh. No, they don't, no. I, I glanced at the clock when, F um, we started C and I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something. C But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening C and I'm, I love gardening C and she did too, C an, C and, after, after about twelve minutes or something, the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape <laughter>. Uhhuh, C but it's been so much fun too, F uh, talk. D Well, my best friend in Virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in Texas. C And so she knew that I had the time and would be, would enjoy it. F Um, D so. C But I have a hard time getting anybody, because I guess, do you work. Yeah, C and probably just got home. C So, F um, during the day, I me, I thi, C and I understand also they want men. Yeah, my husband does. Yes. Yes, wh, I think so too, C and I haven't helped them out on the me, on men particularly, C but my husband had been ma, in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time, I try to, D you know, make them do, during the day, C but nobody's home. D Well good. Yeah it so fo, much fun to talk to you. You too, bye. F Oh, I sure do, I have a cat and a dog named Joey. Uhhuh, he's the little boy Pomeranian. C And we just got a new addition to the family, so to speak, we also have a fish. <Laughter> It's a mud dog. It's a mud dog. It's, F uh, a cross between a catfish and, F uh, I don't know what, a salamander. Uhhuh, we have a cat, Stripper. F Oh, the mud dog. F Uh, we had a friend give it to us. <Laughter> Yeah, we'd like to get him a friend C but F um, F uh, we haven't found one yet. C So how about you, do you have any pets? F Oh really, what kind? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, how long have you had them. Uhhuh. F Oh no. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, is that right? Huh, I had no idea, I hadn't, didn't even know that. F Um, our dog, Joey, has, F uh, a back problem. F Uh, he, he's got a bad back C but he's seven, F uh, I guess he's abo, almost eight years old. F Um, he just, F uh, he doesn't, he, F uh, yo, he rolls o, he doesn't like to roll over. F Um, e, you just, when you touch him a certain way on the back, C but otherwise, he can jump, F uh, D you know, just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way. Uhhuh. <Laughter> I bet. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Do you have to give those? F Oh, I believe me, I understand. F Uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, yeah, I've never heard anything about it either. Uhhuh. Does he get, is he an inside dog also, C or does he just run out in the backyard? Is he fenced in? F Oh, yeah, uhhuh. F Oh, that's nice. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, Stripper, D well he started out being a little orphan, C and we, we took him in C and, F uh, he's about two years old now C and he loves his treats, F uh, both, F uh, Joey and, F uh, Stripper get treats <laughter>. C And, F uh, let's see, F Oh, D well he's outside C and, F uh, he's got a way to get in, he's got free access of a window we like to keep open. C So, he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to. <Laughter>. Joey, on the other hand is a little different. He has to go out whenever, F uh, we ask him C and when he, when we ask him, he, F uh, he barks. He'll either bark for food, or he'll bark to go out C and he'll tell you which one he wants. He's been through obedience school. F Oh, definitely. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. I'm not for sure. I think maybe we have, C but, F Oh, definitely. Have you ever done this before? F Oh, okay, F um, I haven't ever called. I've put in the paper work, I just never made the call. Yeah, D so I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up C or, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, <laughter> D well, at least you know you did your part. How did you get into this. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh, that's true. E I mean, I, F Um, yes I do. Uhhuh. Right, I was going to tell you the same thing. They're really looking for a lot more men to participate. Does he. Yeah, I need to, I've got some applications, I need to hand them out. C But, F uh, this is a great project, that they're working on C and it's really going to lead the way, F uh, for a lot of econ, F um, applications and, and development in the voice area. Uhhuh. D Well this is the perfect time for me. D Well maybe I'll get you next time. <Laughter> All right, have a good one. Bye.
