Okay, do you want to go first? Fitness and exercise. Okay, F um, I like to do, F uh, weight training and, and cycling. And just walking, F uh, swimming. I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall. C And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore, C so I had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit <throat_clearing>. Thirtyeight. D Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to. Really? Oh. F Oh, I bet that helps. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right. D Well, E I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself, C and you probably do. This is true. D Well, that, I can believe that. Have you tried the, F uh, the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center? Yes. It is. They keep it at eightyone degrees yearround. F Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, F uh, more on the weekends, F uh, I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center. <Laughter> F Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet? You need to put that on there, seriously. F Oh, you don't? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. This is true. Yeah. D Well, it's not, D Now what year are we talking about? Okay, F uh, things have become much more enlightened since then. Yeah, D you know, we still don't have a day care facility C but people are more sympathetic to it. Yes. Yes. Oh. My gosh. Could you hold the phone for one second, Thanks. <<Pause>> Okay, I'm back. Wow. Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back. Really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, really. Yeah. There you go. I, I can believe that. F Oh, yeah, flex time is great. I, I can understand. I can understand. D Well, it's been good talking with you. F Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month. Yeah, E I mean, F uh, to add dependents is, is D you know, maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal. Yeah. F Uh, you do for classes, for classes, C but to, E I mean to use any of the facilities is, is no extra charge. Yeah, it is. Or, or a depe, or a dependent of one. Really. Wonderful. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, it's great. F Uh, D well, it would depend on when you go it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. F Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all. If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site. F Oh, D well, then you could go either one, the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities C and you'd probably like the pool there. D Well, good. I'm glad. D Well, thank you. You have a good day. Byebye. D Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic. F Oh, God <laughter>. No, why don't you go first. D Well, let me ask a personal question, how old are you? F Oh, D well then you should D see over thirtyfive everything goes downhill flop. F Oh, you're lucky then C because I've battled arthritis all my life, E I mean even since I was D like about two or three. Then they diagnosed it, C and usually most people are just absolutely crippled, C and, F uh, I do water aerobics. Religiously do water aerobics, I used to do it about six times a week C and now I'm down to about four C but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh, in there, F uh, I tried weight training <laughter> C and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift the things. C And the shock on the system is, is just too much, C so I have stuck to water aerobics basically, D you know, the weightless thing and, trying to keep this shape that way C but, D you know, it's hard to find. E I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are, <breathing>, I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way, to get in shape, without having to spend anything C or it's the geriatric crowd. C So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. <Breathing> Yeah, C but you have to have an indoor pool. C So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, D you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water, that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training, C and that does look very odd in the water. No, C and D you know, that's the only place I haven't tried C and people have told me. D Now that's the Texins facility? I have been told that thing is just lovely. Huh. He, do you use that facility a lot? Huh. Do you know if they have child care there? <Laughter>. They don't, I don't, I don't work at T I. No, I used to work at T I, as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position D actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry <breathing>, C and I used to fill out those attitude surveys, C and, F uh, F uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other C and my husband still works there, C and, F um, I get my attitude expressed through them, C but I find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short, mentality to save a few bucks. <Breathing> F Uh, C and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I C and I came down here C and, D you know, they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here C and I asked about, D you know, day care for the shift workers, C and D boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, D you know, it was not applicable to me C and I was kind of horrified. We're talking nineteen seventyeight. They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages <laughter>. I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care, C and, F uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and A I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. F Um, I had been rated number one in the field C and then I took, F uh, when I became pregnant I also got meningitis, and then delivered the first baby three months early, C and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home, C and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment. Sure. C And then they used to, F uh, C and then I had a second one eighteen months later, they told me to put them back to back C and, of course, to maintain C and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one, because that's when I go into labor four and a half months C and I don't even know it. F Oh, yeah, very easy, very easy C and they, they put me on twentyfour hour fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was going, C and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor. I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof, because it was a, F uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill, <breathing> C but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work, C and that was when they had, God it would have been the eightyfive layoff, <Breathing> C and I'll tell you how they handled this C and I was just outraged, I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, F uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later C and they didn't have any coverage under my name C and I went back C and I said what the hell is going on here, D you know. C And they told me that, F uh, F oh, D well, D you know, D you know, your husband works here C and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway, C and, F uh, D you know, we've got people here that really, D you know, need to be working C and so that we had just, D you know, it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person C and we'd just let you go. C And it took me about a year of arguing, I said, D you know, I've got to put this in writing to me, and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits C and I couldn't get my, F uh, termination benefits either. I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. <Noise> C But I, I guess things have gotten better, I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things, I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, D you know, get me to go back, ever again <laughter>. C But let me ask you this, since you use Texans, how much is it a month? D Now that's for individual. That's it? D Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking? God, that's cheap. That's really cheap. Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or, Or a depe, God, I am so dependent these days. It's a sense <laughter>. F Oh, seen that my, my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence. Yeah <laughter>. C So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment C but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans. I really think I am, E I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time. Huh. All righty. When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell? D See I'd want to be there in the mornings D like from nine thirty to ten thirty <noise>. <Breathing> F Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line. Yeah. F Oh, God it sounds like I would. I might do that then. Okay, I learned something here. You can go back to work now. Thank you. Byebye.
