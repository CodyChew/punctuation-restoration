D Well, how do you feel about capital punishment? F Oh, you did? Wow. <Laughter>. F Oh, really <laughter>? Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, wow. Okay. Wow. Really? Wow <laughter>. Yeah, D well, the cases like that, they should, E I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back. Really? Right. Wow. Uhhuh. No, no remorse whatsoever, F huh. D Well, I guess in cases like that, D you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again E I mean, you've got to do something. Right. Wow. You're kidding. Right. Really? D Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun, F Oh, really? Okay. Oh. Wow. What, I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case. Okay. Of that crime C but he was found guilty of anoth, okay. That works. Right. D Well, they pushing the death penalty? Wow. Okay. C So, Yeah, C and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much. That's true. E I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole, That's true. Uhhuh. That's true. E I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not C or, Yes, ma'am. Yes, they do. I, they've had a, a number of cases here. E I mean, not a whole lot, D well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixtyfirst murder this year. It was like last D like year they had fortynine C so that's going up. C But, yeah, they have a death penalty. I hear of one every now and then. C And I visited the prison up here and, at Parchman C and I've been, I haven't, they won't let you on death row, C but they'll let you look down the hall. You can't see any prisoners C and, C and it's kind of a weird feeling. I've been they took us around on a tour, D you know, <noise> C and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber C and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, D like, people have died here. C But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there, <Laughter> D Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case. Yeah, I was on the jury. F Uh, Yeah <laughter>. Which is funny because I got called last night C and the topic was, F uh, something about juries <laughter>. Yeah, C so I am just hitting it right. F Uh, how do I feel about it? I, I don't know. D Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. F Uh, Becau, D well, the one I was just on, I don't, I was an alternate on the case, C so I don't know what was decided. They are probably still in deliberations on it. C But, F uh, what I found out, once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did. C And, F uh, <noise> he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy C and I remember hearing about it. It was about a year ago. F Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month C and he was caught just, they, they drove up, the police drove up just as he fired the g, gun and killed the guy. C So he was caught C and, F uh, it's interesting because the county I live in, I'm not in Dallas county, I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas. F Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had t, two capital murders. C And last year there were six C and this guy is indicted on three of them. Yeah, C so you have to wonder <laughter>, D you know. Yeah. Yeah, although, D you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him. D You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done. He just, D well, from what I can tell. E I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything, C but E I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anythi, anybody's life including his own. C So, it's, it's kind of strange that, D you know, No, huhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D well, it's funny because when, D you know, they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours. C And I, the, I was the, I think the ninety eighth person <laughter> they'd interviewed. C But, D you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone C and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt C and I said I can't imagine, I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah, I guess I could convict him, C but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something. C But they really did. It was, it was really amazing. D Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about. C But this particular case, E I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released C so no one else would have known. It was, it was really pretty interesting. Educational. D Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it. Right. Right, C so <laughter> D you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much to prove that. C So, F Uh, yeah, this guy is up for the death penalty. F Uh, C and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, F uh, in the punishment phase. F Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation <noise>. C And there is a number of questions C and just depending on whether you say yes or no, F uh, you, you can give him capital punishment C and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, <noise> then you can look at mitigating circumstances. C So there is a lot of outs, C but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison. Yeah <laughter>. Right, C and, C and to me, E I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life. Yeah, C but, C But then you have to look at reality. E I mean, I think, D you know, normally they, they may get out C so, C But what is it worth? I don't know. Personally <laughter> I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself. Yeah, D so, you said you're from Mississippi? C And do they have the death penalty there? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. Ooh. That's right.
