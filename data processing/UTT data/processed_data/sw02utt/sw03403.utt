D Well, what's your favorite baseball team, Rita? <Laughter>. D Well, that isn't a, a true false or right or wrong test here. Not a Cubbies fan, F huh. D Well, that's all right. How do you expect them to do this year? Okay. D Well, I'll tell you. I just, F uh, moved down from South Dakota in July, C and, F uh, in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living C and so everybody was a Twins fan, C and I was kind of, F uh, didn't have much interest in the Twins, D you know, it was, it was kind of pathetic, E I mean, we only had two radio stations, C and one of them broadcast every Twins game live, D you know, C and, C and the other one was country. <Laughter> C So, that's right. There's was Twins there, or, D you know Skip Williams. It sure was, it sure was. D Well, I I would like to a, a, assume that they're going to do, do better this coming year, I was sure hopeful anyway. When we moved down, F uh, I was able to go to my first, D you know baseball game, and thought, this is great, this is incredible. C So I became a Rangers fan. I didn't really have one in South Dakota. C So I adopted the Rangers, C or rather they adopted me, I guess C and, F uh, it was just exciting, D you know, you can watch baseball on T V C and they hit the long ball, C and it looks like wow, they really hit that ball. C But when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far D you know, C and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you, C and. That's right, that's right. The Restaurant Ha, Huh. Right. That's right C and he's still doing great still doing excellent. D Well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers? Management. Right. That's right. D You know, some of the, D like, F uh, Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when, when, F uh, Nolan Ryan started pitching. C And it's just incredible to think that there's, F uh, there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan, D you know, C and now their sons are. Uhhuh, I wasn't. Was it Nolan against, F uh Ryan against Ryan, F huh. D Well that is neat. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I suppose I'm supposed to say the Rangers, right <laughter>. Is that what I, is the million dollar question here? <Laughter> Yeah. F Uh, F uh, D you know, I would D like to say the Rangers, C but unfortunately they're not. I was from Illinois, C and my favorite team was the White Sox. No, no, my family, my dad was, C but I turned out to be a White Sox fan. I lived in Chicago. Yeah they did pretty well. What did you think of the World Series? Uhhuh. <Laughter> C So you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you. <Laughter>. Or country. Yeah. F Oh, F uh, C and I was routing for the Twins myself because, F uh, they, a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here, F uh, went to Minnesota, C and we used to tease about, my son C and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota, C but it was int, it certainly was an exciting Series, anyway. What do you think going to happen to the Rangers? C Or can we predict? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No. F Oh, isn't it though. D You know, C but, F oh, I, I think going to the ball park just really makes it. Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you're more a part of it too. D Well, I'm a great sports enthusiast, C so I love, D you know, baseball teams, C and they, in fact, on the news tonight, Nolan Ryan was on there. He was being, he was put in the, A which I never knew existed, the Restaurant Hall of Fame <laughter>. The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight, C and he, F uh, says he's coming back, D you know, F uh, he doesn't know how many years E I mean, to pitch. He'll be at least one more, C and he said he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more. He likes it. Yeah. That's right. D You know, C and he said, I get a kick out of it, D you know, he's, he's such a nice man. Yeah, C and he, D you know when he quits at being active, he will go into, D you know being a, managing and, D yeah, D you know, being a coach, I'm sure. C But, he's, F uh, he certainly is a good example, F uh, for the kids. D You know, you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see what a fine man, that, he is. That's right. Uhhuh. F Oh, he's been a legend for so many years, D you know, C and I don't know, were you here, had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son. His son pitched for U T C and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers. Yeah, it was a, I think it was a little early part of the summer, C and F uh, Nolan against. Ryan against Ryan, yeah, his son pitched for U T C and, F uh, only, F uh, Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing. A game is a game, D you know. D Well, the Rangers really, F uh, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect D you know, anyway, C but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something, D you know, of the game C so,
