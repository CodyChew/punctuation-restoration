D Well, do you own a P C? F Oh, wow. What processor does it have in it? F Oh <laughter> what kind of work do you do on it? F Oh, okay. Yeah. F Huh, yeah, I don't own a P C C but I've, I've, D yeah, I work for T I C and, F uh, D Well, I have, F uh, pretty, fa, a fairly fancy one, it's a T I model. It's an S P one thousand which, has a, it has a fast processor in it, a three eightysix. C And I, the, the job that I do, I do a lot of training of our customers for new products. C And I have to develop, F uh, functional specs and <noise>, disk and desk top publishing and everything, C so it's, it's kind of fun, E I mean, I, I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house C but I just haven't got around to doing it yet. Your husband, what, what group is your husband in? Oh,? Defense systems and electronics group? I see. Yeah. F Oh, okay. Yeah, I work on, F uh, printers and, the peripheral products division, basically, F uh, I work in the airline, ma, marketing group. C So, we, we do a lot of, F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Is he a programmer? I see. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Really. C So, F uh, does your husband ever use, F uh, a laptop or a notebook? Does he bring a little one home with him C or, Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Yeah, we, we build, F uh, laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also. C And those are really handy, E I mean, we, they, they have modems in them, you can send a fax from your P C, C but they're, they're really, What's that? Yeah, they're, they're pretty handy because, D you know, when I travel, it's easy to check messages, just, D you know, plug in the phone to your computer and dial in C and, F Oh, okay. Yeah, I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again. C So that kind of reeks havoc with plans, C but, it, it's really not enough to become a big hassle. I see. D Well, I don't know, there, you can get, D well, depends on what you consider expensive, E I mean, you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars, where, D you know, just a few years ago it would have been six, seven, eight, nine thousand dollars. Yeah, it's still, E I mean, D you know, two thousand dollars isn't just, just pocket change to a lot of people <laughter>. Yeah, when I started at, F uh, T I, I was a Summer development student, and finishing up at school C and so those papers really, E I mean, it was nice having access to the, equipment to, F uh, Yeah. D Well, how many different types of packages do you use? Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Yeah. Golly, I've got, up, up at work anyway, I use WordPerfect and Lotus and, and which is, F uh, F uh, a, a linedraw package. Yeah. You probably use or something like that, for your, F uh, data entry stuff that your, talking about. Do you get, do you work at home all the time C or just, Uhhuh. F Oh, that, that was, that worked out pretty good then. Uhhuh. Yeah. C So, it keeps you in the company, F huh? Uhhuh. Yeah. Boy I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here, I'd get all kinds of stuff done. Phone's always ringing C and, people always asking me to do something else. I've got a lot of, especially right now, we've got several new products coming out, C and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise. D Well, yeah, C but, D you know, I need to be at the office, too. D You know <laughter>, I've just got to deal, with all those other things that happen C but, a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off. Uhhuh, D well, I've, I've done that before on, a couple times. C But that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer, you just bring home a few floppy disks, D you know. F Oh, my. Man that sounds really nice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well. Yeah, we sort of stayed to the topic anyway. Okay, D well, we'll talk to you later. Bye. No, I don't, I have one at, F uh, the company I work for furnishes, C so I can work at home. C And it's just an old, old compact, that is super slow C and, C but it does, it does it's job, C so. F Um, I don't know, it's so old. It's one of, F Um, I do, F um, television ratings C and I process some ratings and put, do graphics for their television stations, their clients, C so. It's basically just data entry and running, D you know, some, some software C so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated, D you know. Yeah, my husband does, too, C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, I'd like to have one for the house, too, C but sometimes my husband, my husband says usually, I work on the computer all day at work, I don't want to come home and have to <laughter> work on one, too. F Um, something with the defense. F Huh? Yeah, something like that, yeah, they've changed their name so many times I've lost track, C so. He works up in Plano. D So <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Oh. I didn't even know they had anything like that. Man, there's so, they're, I learned so many things that they, they do, they're into so many different things, C so. Yeah, I just kind of, in for a while, D you know, he had a, he had, F uh, one of those, what are they, top secret things, D you know, where he couldn't talk about what he did, so. For a while C but then he switched jobs. I don't understand half the stuff he does C and, I have, F uh, Uhhuh. Software design engineer, so, as they call it, C so. C But I have a degree in information management, which is computer, D you know, it's basically the, more the bus, business end of it than the programming end of it, D you know. C So, C but I've been at it for, D you know, five years, C so. Everything's changed so much I probably couldn't even <laughter> get a job right now. It seems like it's changed so much, C so, D you know, they've made such advances in computers, C so. No, huhuh, sometimes he bri, he brought home a, F uh, a portable one, C but, F uh, it, it quit working C so he brought it, brought it back C and he just hasn't brought another one home. C But they did give him a new computer at work, C so. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, how nice, no, he doesn't have one of those, C so. He doesn't have one of those. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, my husband doesn't have to travel, C so. F Oh, boy. D Well at least you get to, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, that's good. Some people enjoy the travel C but I don't think I'd like it, <<very faint>> if he traveled a lot. Yeah, I would love to have a computer, they, C but they're so expensive. Uhhuh. Yeah. D You know, I guess it's not, it's all, D you know, it's, inexpensive compared to what it used to be C but it's a lot to put into one. That's right <laughter>. No, it's not. It's, it's not pocket change, C so it's major. Maybe when the kids get in school that will be, D you know, when they start needing something, D you know, then that will be different C but, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yes, I remember that. I had to do some of my husband's papers because I had access to one C but, D you know, he, his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing, D you know, C so, I did a lot of his papers. Yeah, they come in real handy, that was a lifesaver. At home? F Um, all I, the packages I, I don't really use, I what I use that outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that I use. Yeah, I know those two. Uhhuh, I've just used WordPerfect and Lotus and, the most. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the data entry stuff they used, F uh, survey system and, and, F um, D you know, just inhouse programs to do what they needed. I work, D Well, no, I worked for this company before I had my first daughter, C and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things, C so. Yeah, it did. D You know, I don't do, I don't really don't do basic, a lot of what I used to do, I just do, D you know, something really minor C but, it's something that nobody else wants to do, C and it's time consuming. C So, That's right, D you know, it gives me a paycheck, D you know, it's only D like the works only, D you know, three weeks. Goes for D like three to four weeks three times a year, D you know, it's not something that's continual because, D you know, the television ratings don't come out, D you know, all the time. They only come out four times a year, D so C but. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, will they let you take a computer home to work? F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. Yeah, my hu, he took one home when they, when they had it, D you know, they had a big deadline coming up C and it was looking a little touchy to meet, C so. Yeah. Uhhuh, that's right. I thought that would be, D you know, C because it's real nice with this because I don't even have to go into the office I've maybe been into the office once in the past three years, D you know. They just, F um, they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever, C so, D you know. Yeah. It is real nice, D you know, I just deal with them on the telephone, half the people don't even know who they're talking to. C But I, D you know, worked, I know most of them, D well, I can't say that, a lot of people changed around there C but, most people know who I am, C but I don't know who they are, D you know. <Laughter> A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice. Yeah, you just know them by the telephone, C so. C But, D well, it's been good talking to you, I think we've got the subject <laughter>. Yeah, we tried. It's hard to sometimes. Okay, D well, thanks, bye, bye.
