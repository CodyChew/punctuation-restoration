Right. F Oh how way back, E I mean <laughter> Okay C so Wally Moon moon shots and all that. Yeah, coliseum, Wally Moon and all that. Okay, yeah, it's a, F um, I, I'm living in, just west of Baltimore, and Frederick, F um, which is also just west of Baltimore, has a minor league team. C And, F uh, C and, Wally Moon is the manager of them. Yeah, C so he's still kicking around. F Oh, I saw them, F um, F um, I was out there last Summer, C and I saw a game at Ned Skelton. Is that the stadium? F Oh, okay. C So, F um, there used to be a, F uh, race track. Yeah, it was, that was impression I got when I was there C so, Okay, yeah, C so had a lot of fun D actually, E I mean, I like minor league baseball, a lot. It's cheaper for one thing <laughter>. Yes <laughter>. I think they're in for a odd year this year, D actually, F um, they, F um, I don't understand why Encovilla got released. E I mean, he, D you know, he can't field C and, D you know, he strikes out a lot, C but, E I mean, he's done that for five years. Why get rid of him now? F Oh, yes. Okay. F Oh, okay. F Oh, he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, E I mean with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot. Yeah, D well, E I mean, with Detroit, E I mean, they can get away with one guy like that. E I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder. C But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out D you know, which they did. D So. I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter. I, I like them a lot. I think they're going to go all the way. F Um, C and, C and, E I mean, by saying I like them, I like their chances. I, I actually don't like the Dodgers, I'm a Giants fan from way back. No, C but Butler didn't hurt either. F Uh, C and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt C and, Bobby Ojeda. They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks. F Um, he's a, a pretty decent pitcher. He's, Okay, D you know, he. C And, F uh, that guy, the short stop, is going to be good. F Um. Yeah, I'm looking, I've already been to one game, C and I should have been to two C but, F Um, the, the team I live and die with D actually is the Red Sox, mostly die, C but, F um, I go to the Orioles since they're here, C and I, D you know, I do enjoy them. F Um, I've had an opening day on Monday. How far is Houston? F Oh, okay, keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes. Yeah, I, F um, D you know, we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia. C And, F um, saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before. Okay, F uh, yeah <laughter>. F Um, I try to see whatever I can. E I mean, I've been to D like thirty or forty games each of the last few years. Yeah, hope I'm going to do it this year because, F um, F uh, having a kid this fall, C so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games. Yeah, seriously. Yeah, good talking with you. C And, C and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win. Yeah, I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right <laughter>. C And good talking with you. Take care. Bye. There we go. D Well, D actually I'm a, I'm a Dodgers fan from way back. F Um, D Like, F um, late fifties, early sixties. What's that? Yeah. Is that right? That's interesting. Yeah, I, I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to, F uh, going away to college, C and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens. F Uh, I couldn't tell you for sure. It's been a long time. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think that's right. D Well, that's true. I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here. F Uh, they've led the American league in batting, fielding and pitching, C but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any, any given year. C So. I don't either. E I mean, the guy's twenty, twentyfive home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some R B Is. Really, E I mean, he really has become a, a very decent fielder. He's not a, the liability that he was, that he used to be. F Um. Yeah, of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, D you know, if he strikes out a lot, so what. F Oh, yeah. Right. Yep. D Well, I think the key for, for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back. It may be. Right, right. D Well, picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt. F Uh, who's the last one. F Oh, okay. Yes he is. Yes. Yeah. D Well it should be an interesting year. Are you an Orioles fan? Yeah. Yeah, D you know, I kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while. F Uh, three hundred miles. Yeah, it is, it's incredible. There you go. Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you. Interesting. Wow. All right. C So, C so do it while you can. Sure. D Well, it's been good talking with you. I wouldn't mind it. Yeah, D well, God bless C and good talking with you. Byebye.
