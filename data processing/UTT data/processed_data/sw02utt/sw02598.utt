Yeah, I'm trying to think what I've seen lately. E I me, we, D well we just finished watching, F uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, D you know <laughter>. Yeah, we, we've seen that, yeah. Yeah, it was great, have you seen it? Yeah, I, F um, We, we saw, an, we liked it C but, D you know, I didn't think it was as good as all the, F uh, hype was about it. Yeah, I don, I, I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, F uh, best picture. Yeah, yeah, C and so we just, F Uh, it depends, F um, D you know, it depends on wh, I'd like to see those, I keep, D you know, F um, D you know, there's like three movies that I, I keep telling myself that I should see one of these, D you know, some day that I haven't seen, D you know, that, that are classics, D you know. C Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE, C and never seen, I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND. Uhhuh. F Oh, I, I def, we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on, on T V a couple of years ago, C and I've, I've alwa, I've been wanting to see all of it C but we just, D you know, we walk into the video store C and we're like D well why don't we go see this now <laughter>, C so. C But, F um, I think, one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, F uh, MISERY. That was good, F um, F oh, it was great. C And it, you think, D you know, for a Stephen, D you know, it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory C but there's only one, D well there's a couple scenes, at, at the end there's, there is, D you know some blood and everything C and there's one really bad scene where it's, E I mean, there's not blood but it's pretty graphic <laughter>. C But it's, F um, it's a really good movie, F um. Yeah, yeah, he's a writer C and, F um, she's his biggest fan C and she's also <laughter>, a little, a little on the nutso side. No, we haven't, F um, F Oh, it wasn't? Oka, I, I got, I heard D like mixed reviews, F um, of that, we s, That's, that's on our list of things to see <laughter>. N, our big thing is, F um, D you know, mo, movie prices up here I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters, D you know. C So it's like, D you know, a lot of things we try to catch D like at the dollar theater or matinees C and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape. Ye, D well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, F uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Yeah, have you seen that? F Oh, it was great <laughter>. Yeah it was, No, no, it's, F um, it's an odd film C and it's really interesting that, I like the director a lot, F um, a guy named Tim Burton. Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE? F Oh, ok, F Oh, se, yeah, D well if you, if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Yeah, it's, F um, Burton's kind of, F uh, e, he's, a very odd, odd man C but he's, I think he's very interesting C and, F uh, I liked those two movies of his a lot. He did BATMAN also, which, D you know <breathing> <laughter>. It was good, C but E I mean, he was, F um, Yeah. F Oh, yeah, F oh. Yeah. F Um, don't really know, I like Costner a lot C but, F uh, I'm a big, I'm a big baseball fan C so, D you know, after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS, D you know, F Um, although, D you know, Which one? Yeah, FIELD OF DREAMS was good, F um, C and, I, I think, I liked the other movies he's done. NO WAY OUT was really good C and, did you ever see SILVERADO? F Um, let's see. Danny Glover, Scott Glen, Kevin Kline, F um, Brian Dennehy, Jeff Goldblum's in. F Uh, John Kreas is in it if you don't blink. It was, it was a big western, E I mean, I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her. F Uh, it was, C and I think it was D like a three hour movie or two and a half hours, C and, C and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out. F Um, C but it was, it was really good <laughter>. F Um, Uhhuh. No, I didn't, is that any good? F Oh, okay. Yeah, we were in the video store today C and somebody was recommending it to somebody. D You know the, the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else. F Huh, D well, I'll have to catch it one of these days. You sa, you, you said you seen NO WAY OUT? Yeah, that was very good. F Um, he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too. Yeah, it was on, F um, no, it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend. F Uh, or two weeks ago. Yeah, I, F um, I wish, E I, I mean I'd seen it when, when, D you know, it was originally in the theaters C and, F um, I saw it, D you know, I saw part of it again. E I mean I like, D you know, I like Costner, I like Sean Connery, C and, F uh, there's this one, there's this one actor, it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot C but I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith. F Um, you've probably seen him C and just, an, D you know, F oh, that's who the guy is. Do you remember, did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI? Oh. Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN. Okay, in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, F um, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen, or Nancy Allen. D You know, w, short nerdy guy with glasses. He's, he's just, I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in. He was in the UNTOUCHABLES. He was the accountant <laughter>. Yeah. No, no, you're thinking of Rick Moranis. He looks like Rick Moranis C but he's not <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, a little of, e, e, a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see. No, it's o, F uh, I want to see it. F Um, we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also C but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago, C but I've never seen either of the first, D you know, of the, of the GODFATHER movies C so, we're probably going to D like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere. Yeah. F Oh, okay, I haven't, never read it. Uhhuh. We just rented, F um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN, with, F um, it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, F um, F uh, Marlon Brando. C And Brando D like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER. F Um, yeah, it's, it's one of the reasons why, D you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately. F Um, C but, F uh, there's a bunch of scenes from, F uh, F uh, from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school. C And, F uh, in his classes they're using, there's a bun, they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER C and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, D you know, this Maf, D you know this, F uh, organized crime head. C So, it's F um, it was, it was a fun movie. F Uh. I liked RAINMAN, I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing som, Yeah, D well I'm, being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, F uh, he, he's, D you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies. F Um, n, Barry Levinson did, F um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore. Uhhuh. Ye, we, Ye, of the three of those, DINER's probably the best. E I mean, they're, they're all pretty good, C but DINER is really worth seeing. F Uh, late fifties, yeah. Okay C and, F uh, Do you want to start? G, Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES, did you <static> see the movie? Did you like it? I thought it was very well done. How about GHOST? Right, I feel the same way about that too. It was okay. No, no. C And, F uh, wh, let's see, F uh, the most recent ones that I've seen are those two, GHOST and, F uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, C but I rent, F uh, F uh, videos, do you? You, you watch many? Do you like the classics like, F uh, GONE WITH THE WIND and, F uh, D you know the older movies. Yeah, that was good. I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, in, D you know a long time ago, C and, F uh, D like the MALTESE FALCON and all those, F uh, F uh, Yeah, that was good, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's true. F Oh, I didn't see that one. Really. <Laughter>. Yeah. Really, is that the one where, F uh, the guy gets captured by that women? Okay, yeah. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS? I saw that one, that one wasn't that great either. D Well I didn't think so, no. How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? I know, I, I wanted to see, I, I was curious if you had seen it C and that, F uh, Yeah. That's us too, yeah, yeah true. I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive. F Oh, really. No. Really. I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad, Uhhuh. F Uh, part of it, I, I never really watched the whole thing. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Yeah, that was pretty good, though, D really. When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, D you know. You see it for, F uh, D you know a couple of hours or an hour C and it really, there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars, and all the different stuff like that, D you know. Whose your favorite actress or actor? Uhhuh. Yeah. That was good, I saw that movie too. That was very good. FIELD OF DREAMS. F Oh, yeah, yeah. SILVERADO, F uh, who, who was that with? That, the nam, the, the title sounds familiar, I'm trying to thi, F Oh, really. I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I wo, I would remember, I think in, with him in it. How about REVENGE, did you see that with him? With, F uh, Anthony Quinn. I thought it was, I like everything he's done so far. D You know, it's, F uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie C but it was okay. Yeah it was, it was not a bad movie. Yeah, that was excellent. D Now that's another one I wanted to see. Tha, in fact, that was advertised not too long ago. Cable? Okay, I know I saw, D yeah, something about it. Uhhuh. I don't know him. <Laughter>. No, I, I don't think so. Yes. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, F oh I know who you mean. He was in, F uh, F uh, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he? F Oh, okay, <laughter> se, all right, yeah, that's the one I was thinking of. C But I have, I've seen quite a few movies, I, I enjoy them. I think that, F uh, it's, it's kind of D like, F uh, good entertainment. An, F uh, an escape type of thing. How about some of the ads, do you go by the ads when you look at them, or the reviews? Do they influence you a lot. Yeah. Did you see GOODFELLAS? That wa, that was pretty good. F Um, C and, Uhhuh. I was just going to say, th, you should see those, fi, F uh, first if you can. If y, if you read the book it's, F uh, even better. The book was excellent. Yeah. C and, F uh, I was a little disappointed in the third on, it's GODFATHER THREE. It was not bad C but, I expected more, I think. F Oh, really. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. How about Tom Cruise, do you like his stuff? COCKTAILS, C or, F uh, F Oh, yeah, that was good, I liked RAINMAN, too. Uhhuh. Yeah, they sound familiar. I probably saw parts of those. D You know, a lot of times I'll wa, I'll start watching a movie C and I'm tired C and it, next thing you know, it's, it's especially if there's commercial in it <laughter>. C and then the titles might sound familiar C but I really don't know what they're all about. Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties. Late fifties, yeah, I think I saw that one. How about Meryl Streep,
