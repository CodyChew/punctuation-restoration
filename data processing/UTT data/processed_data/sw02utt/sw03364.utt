I really don't watch a whole lot of T V, just, D you know, on Sunday nights, LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner, C and my whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night D you know, because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day, C and so we, we sit around and eat popcorn C and, F oh, then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS. Those are always pretty cute. F Oh, C so you don't watch that one instead of, Sure. Yeah, we like that real well. Uhhuh. I know.

F Um, then during daytimes I like, I like ALL MY CHILDREN. ALL MY CHILDREN, I've watched that for about twelve years. I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed. C So that was a long time ago. I used to watch it, was in high school and college when Laura's mother got killed. She was my favorite character on there. I just, I read the reason she got, they, they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract, C and I said, D well, if they're going to do that to her, I won't watch it. I, I, I like it. I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back. Yeah, I'm sure he will. I kind of wish that, F uh, Nina would come back because she because the story, D you know, just for a brief visit or whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying, and everything, Yeah, Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now. Yeah, he's out for good. F Uh that's how they left the show, but not in real life. Now she's married to some guy in New York, C and she's happily married C and that's the reason she left the show. I guess she wanted a private life. F Oh, D well, I, I watch. I watch it everyday, religiously. I videotape it when I have to miss it. Yeah. I'm that way about a lot of different shows. I'm that way about MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN. F Uh, yeah, there's two new characters on there. There's, F um, F uh, Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE. I don't know if you know her or not. C And then, C and then, F uh, <lipsmack>, F uh, the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART. I don't like her on it, I never have liked her, C so. She's taken the Suzanne's part, C and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part. Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed. Yeah. D Well, MURDER, SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that, C and so, Yeah I I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different networks, C but BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH, I, I watch it religiously. It, be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody's getting killed on it. Who is it? Ask them <laughter>.
