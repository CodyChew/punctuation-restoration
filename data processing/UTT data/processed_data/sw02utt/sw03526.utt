D Well, I, F uh, couple of them, I, at the moment, use an A S T two eightysix C and I got a leading edge C and I got a American one and had a I B M one, C but <laughter>, What do you have <laughter>? F Oh, yeah? What did you do, put it together? D Well, that's, Yeah. Yeah. What do you use it for? What do you use it for? F Oh, yeah? What kind of programs do you, Okay, E I mean D like business programs C or, Man. Uhhuh, Huh. D Well, that's, <Laughter> D Well, that sounds interesting. Matter of fact, F uh, I guess you do, F uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, F huh. That's where the speed helps out. Yep, that will, that will, slow you up <laughter>. D Well, I, I do, F uh, F uh, programming for C N C turret presses and F uh, cat cam system type things C and, F uh, really need a faster system. F Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera. F Uh, Who is that? I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one <laughter>. That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them. They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software. C And as they, C And as they go to the next one I just keep the, <laughter> that's why I have so many different levels of P C s around at the moment. A T S? C And where are they at? F Oh, yeah. . In Richardson there. In Richardson? I know where you mean. There is a Mobil and all that kind of s, F uh, on that one corner, that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Really? D Well, that's a good deal. Yeah. F Uh, there is a lot, you ever go by Lucky Computer there? I used to, when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems. Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. C So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days. C But I,, Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down. Yeah. <Laughter> I, Yeah, I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eightysix. That wasn't alive for but maybe two years. Is that right? That's it? I'll be darned. F Huh, D well, Hi, D well, I guess, w, which one have you got right now? C Or, <Laughter> My, my, just a couple. F Uh, I've got an Omega C and I've got a, F uh, generic three eighty, or four eightysix machine. Yeah, it's very, very generic. Yeah, C and, C and, F uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled C and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine <laughter>. That's all I got to say for it. <Noise> Huh? F Uh, work, F uh, I'm a contract programmer. F Uh, anything <laughter>. F Uh, I've done business programming, scien, D you know, scientific applications like, D you know, petroleum science stuff and, F Uh, F uh, test equipment C and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, F uh, touch screens. It was kind of fun. Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, F uh, D you know, attack simulators and, and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, yeah, definitely. F Uh, yeah, unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eightysix. It's D like slow <<dragged out the word>>. <Laughter>. Huh? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I know a guy that upgrades, F uh, for a reasonable cost. <Breathing> F Uh, his name is T Q or something like that. C And my notebook is somewhere around here <groan>. See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough. F Uh, he's, F uh, up in, Huh? Uhhuh. F Oh, that works. F Uh, here it is. A T S Computers. Uhhuh. F Uh, do you know where, F uh, Custer is? Okay, he's, F uh, F uh, south of Renner on, on Custer. C And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center. F Huh? Uhhuh. Right, it's, it's, it's just south of there. It's a little place, looks like a castle. Kind of, F uh, little guy in there. He, <throat_clearing> he, F uh, gives reasonable prices. D Like I, I traded my, F uh, three eightysix for the four eightysix for about six hundred. Yeah, it was pretty reasonable. C But, F uh, F uh, he, C and he does a good job C and he, s, he, he, F uh, guarantees everything he sells. Uhhuh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. F Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center. They're still doing business. Big business, apparently. Uhhuh, F oh, yeah, I was amazed I was able to get this four eightysix for six hundred even with a trade in, D you know, it's like, wow <laughter>. That works, I'll go do that <laughter>. C And boy that thing screams now. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eightysix S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars. Yeah, it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks. Yeah.
