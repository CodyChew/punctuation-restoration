Both. Yes. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, are you Summit or are you, F uh, Spring Creek? F Oh this is fun. What building are you in? F Oh, I'm building two. At least we found something different <laughter>. That's, I've never had a call, No, isn't that funny? I usually get some place, I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called, I think. That is funny. C So, The weather in building two is cold <laughter> it's been cold. It's been cold in the building. Outside the building it's not bad. Typical T I, E or T I, listen I got me doing it. Typical Texas Spring. Are you a native to Texas? From? C So what do you think of the Texas weather? How long have you been here? F Oh, okay. You, you, you know about August then. Okay, there's no surprises left. Uhhuh. Good idea. Real good idea. We went to Alaska. That is really nice. It is so cool, you wear a jacket, D you know. Yeah, or keep one handy. Because it's, it rains a lot in Alaska. F Uh, it, they call it their liquid gold. C But it, D you know, you get sunshine, C and it's lovely, C and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming. F Oh my goodness, it's pretty. D Well, Texas isn't bad. Not in the Spring. Spring is nice. Right. F Oh, we always we always do though. F uh, it, That's right, C and then we get all that heat. Right. <Laughter>. F Oh, really. F Oh, you got into that bad stuff. Isn't that strange. I think that's one of the strange, strange things, C and you very seldom see it though. C So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently. Is that correct? I think, I think that's, It's not on the ground, C but in the clouds it is. I was dumb. I was in, F um, Florida for a week on business. C And I had called back to the house. I stayed the weekend, C and I called back to the house. My housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs, <noise> <<high pitched trill>> said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry, it's in Garland where all the bad weather is. I said, Okay, D you know C and I watched the news, C and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not Plano, I don't have anything to worry about. I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland <laughter>. Felt so dumb. Finally I got home and found out my property was okay. There was no problem with it. C But I guess you just tend to think of, of where your house is D you know, and nothing else. F Oh, F oh, I see. F Oh, okay. The house, that house, that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course. Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through. F Oh really. Is that a nice area? D Well, The house that the house that I bought was really, really nice. Yes, yes. Really, really nice home, very pretty. F Uh. No, I'm going to lease it. It's, it's investment property. C But it is really, it's a very nice place. F Uh, I, I would cheerfully live there. Of course it's not my home, C and I've lived in my home in, D well, almost ten years, C and, D you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it. C But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards. It's a nice house. No, it's not, it's off the golf course, C and I'll be honest with you, I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is. C But it's in the estates that adjoin it. Yes, it is. Yeah, that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the mo, the outer, outermost loop around. Right, just continue to do that. Where are you from in California? San Diego? I've been through all of that. F Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area with boulders, I won, they're not really hills, they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation. F Uh. D Well, D you know, it may be a little bit more inland. That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen. F Uh, I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago C and we went up that coastline, C and I was just amazed how unusual that looks. Here, hang on just a second, I've got a Los Angeles map. Let me just quick <<pause>>. valley. Yes beyond Thousand Oaks. You don't think that's strange looking. F Oh, okay maybe, maybe I'm used to Texas. The elevation is extremely high. It's got curving roads on it, C but, C but the, it's just a strange landscape, there's very little vegetation. Right. It's a, Maybe it's a place I went to, it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place. It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way. F Oh, it's green sometime. D Well, it doesn't stay green, D you know the really, C and in all honesty, I know this sounds like a Texas story, all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years. We haven't had a really bad one, Oh. It may be eightytwo, because we bought our house in eightyone C and we built a pool in eightytwo, Do you live in Plano or work in Plano, or both? Both, are you a T I er? Are you at work right now? So am I. In building, which building? <Laughter>. I'm, I'm, I'm Spring Creek. I'm building, F uh, one. Not like that. Neither have I. Right. That's funny. C So how's the build, how's the weather in building two? No, no, I'm, I'm a transplant. From California. Not as nice as California <laughter>. F Oh, five years now. I've been here long en, pretty long. C So. Yes, F oh, I've been through five of those <laughter>. Right, right. A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August, for, D you know, if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go. <Laughter>. Yeah, we went up to Wyoming this last, F uh, Summer during that time. C And it was like D you know, eighty degrees up there. It was beautiful. Nice to get out of Texas for a while. D Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away. Even in the Summer time, F huh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Is that right? F Um. Green. F Um. Right. No, no. Right. I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's it supposed to like this time of year. Yeah. Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, D you know. It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, D you know, on the local news. March we typically get a lot of rain, C and we've had this many inches, C and, D you know, we're right on target, D you know, C and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March, C but I it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like. Yeah I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once <laughter>. C And, C and. Right. D Well, it's just that, D you know, when it rains, it rains. In California you get these nice, lovely rains, D you know, nothing really down, D you know, like downpours like you have here. The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas. Yeah, I live in Garland. Yeah. We got hail the size of marbles. E I mean, just so noisy hitting the house C and the glass on the windows. It didn't break anything, C but we went out there afterwards C and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn. I know, I, you pick them up, D you know, C and they're perfectly round. C And I go, D gee, how did they form, D you know, so perfect like that. Right, right. I've seen hail, D you know, C but usually the size, D you know, of, F uh, tiny, tiny pebbles. D You know, really small, D you know. C But this was, F uh, really large. F Uh, I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth. You don't think it's cold enough, D you know to, Right, must be. I guess, C and then, I think, D you know, all that falling would warm it up and melt it, C but maybe that's what rounds it, A I don't know. C But, tumbling. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Um. Yeah. Right. Right, C and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's, there's the hard rain. The creek overflows C and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek seem to, to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area, get a lot of flooding. Okay. Right. That's where I live, close to that. Yeah, F uh, F uh, not quite, I don't live in that Firewheel division. C But I live close by there in north, far north Garland. Yeah they're supposed to, it's getting built up, D you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things. D You know, it's a fairly new area. Yeah C and, F uh, <<pause>> C and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninetythree or ninetyfour or something, a brand new mall not too far away from that area, C so. It'd be nice. Uhhuh, in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But you're not living there right now. F Oh, I see. I see. Right. Uhhuh, yeah, that's a nice area. Is it on the golf course? Is that right. Yeah, right, right. D Well that's a nice area. That really is a nice area. When they get that highway finished, you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick. Right, another belt line, just, F uh, farther out. Right, right, right. Southern California. I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a ki, younger, and L A area, C and my parents live in Anaheim right now. Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to anyway. Yeah. . Huh. I'm not familiar with what, is it along the coast or or inland. F Um. Out there, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah, they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles. valley. Okay, I know where that is. I know where Valley is, I've been out there before, sure. I didn't notice anything strange, I guess about it. Maybe Texas the way, Uhhuh. Huh. I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it. I know Valley, yeah, it's just a suburb of L A C And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately. People can get in and out of L A easier. F Huh. Yeah, sounds interesting. Right. Right, right. I, I know exactly that area. It's a nice area out there. I love Thousand Oaks. F Uh, Texas, I don't know, thing, things, you just have less a variety, I guess. I think, I don't think it's quite as green, D you know. It's green with all the trees and things out here C but it's just, Yeah, C but it's just, D you know, I don't know. Right. Yeah I missed that one of eighty or eightytwo or eightyone that had the heat wave.
