Okay. D Well, there, there are quite a few, F um, parks, I guess, state parks, C and there's a couple of national parks, I guess, that you can camp at. F Um, most of them have pretty good facilities. I don't know if the camping that I've done is really roughing it without a, a whole lot of stuff. F Uh, done a little bit of that, mainly just, F um, D like camping out at the state parks, I've been to a couple in Texas C and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas. F Um, I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around. Uhhuh. Yeah, part of them are. Yeah, they've got, F uh, real nice lake system, and, around their parks. One of them, F uh, the gray, A I think that's one of the ones we've been to, it's real nice there, a bunch of lakes around it, there's a golf course and, F um, just a whole bunch of camping sites. What about you, where have you, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think we've collected stuff off and on over the years. The more times we did it, the more serious we get about it. Where, where is Raleigh, in North Carolina? Okay. Are you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains, an area. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, my wife's from the western part of Virginia, we've been down the parkway a lot, C but I didn't know how much, how much camping areas there were along there. What, what's it like camping in the desert and California, that seems, like a challenge. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. Are the temperatures real extreme there C or the, the, Uhhuh. Yeah, <laughter> true. Yeah. Yeah, we've talked about planning a trip up through, F um, I have a sisterinlaw that lives in New Mexico, up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area. <<Very faint>> I don't know, don't know when I'm going to get a chance to do that C but, Uhhuh. I'll bet. That one, one thing you said about the stars is really true it's, when you're close to a big city like Dallas, the, the lights kind of wash, wash off the star C so it's nice to, to get away. It's just amazing, how, how much you miss. F Huh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. D Well, I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject. Yeah, it was good talking to you Robert. Byebye. All right. What, F uh, what kind of camping is there in Texas? Uhhuh. Yeah. D So, you do, F uh, D like backpacking and the like? Uhhuh. Huh. Is the Ozarks in Arkansas? Yeah, C so, that's probably a pretty nice place to go <<pause>>. Yeah. F Oh, I've been camping for years, not on a regular basis C but, F uh, I first started camping out in the desert in California. And then sometimes in the mountains also in California C and, F uh, then I moved to North Carolina C and I, I didn't camp for a long time, C and then I started to, F uh, go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting, C so, I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting. C And then maybe camp another night and drive home. C And that was, F uh, that was pretty good C so, I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear C and, F uh, D you know, I still do it once in a while. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, D well, it's, it's, F uh, in terms of north, south I would say it's, F uh, a little, a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it. C So what i, D Well, it, it's, F uh, actually the, the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh. They're about three hours away if you go due north. F Um, of the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer C and you can pick those up going west, C but then you're talking about six to eight hours. The way it works. C But, F um, it's a real, it's a real nice place to go and camp, C and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although, I don't think Raleigh, I don't think the state of North Carolina takes, they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might. I think there's quite a few. I can't say I've checked them all out though. It's, F uh, it's D actually kind of incredible, it's really, really nice. F Um, I like it better than almost anything I've ever done. Just the sky is so amazing. D You know, you really can probably count thousands of stars, C and, F uh, it's, it's just kind of nice. I like the, F uh, I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which, F uh, a lot of people don't realize, D you know, they hear desert C and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water, course it, it has all of those qualities C but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert. C So, it's pretty nice. The, F uh, the movie, THE DOORS, has so, some nice desert scenes, those guys all go camping out in the desert. Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them C but, F um, the, F uh, the shots are, are pretty nice C and it's sort of like that, E I mean, it's just almost surreal, in some places. It's very pleasant. They can be, yeah. E I mean, you got to, you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen. I've been camping in Death Valley, one doesn't go in July <laughter>. C But it's beautiful in February. E I mean, it's just beautiful. The days, get up into the high eighties, F uh, maybe the nineties C but it's, it's quite bearable C and then the nights are reasonably warm, D you know, sixties or seventies. It's just great. It's really very nice. Yeah. D Well, that would be, that would be pretty nice. I've been, I have been camping on the south rim the Grand Canyon. That's okay. A lot of people like to go down and camp down inside, I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking, especially with my gear. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, it, Yeah, it, yeah, it really is. E I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper, you hear people talk about the Little Dipper. C But I don't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in, in the mountains. Otherwise it's just too faint <<pause>>. Yeah, I think we fulfilled our obligation. D Well, thanks for calling, nice talking to you. Okay, byebye.
