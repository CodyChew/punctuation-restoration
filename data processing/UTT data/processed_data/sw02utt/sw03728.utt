F Um, no, I don't watch much T V. Sometimes, F um, usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news. C But I don't think of that every day, even. F Um, I think I get most of my current events, D well, I get them from everywhere. I sometimes watch T V if I, I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day. We don't get a paper C but I work, F um, at a, I teach a college class C and, F uh there's a, the library has a paper. C And so I often drop in on a break and and read it. C And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home. C And then I, I figure if there's big, big news, I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or, someone else, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, what's your favorite news, do you get a news magazine C or, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, we've got. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage? Yeah, it's kind of hard to know. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I do feel like, a little bit like, being from California and wanting to hear D like I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something, C and I don't ever hear it in the news here. F Um. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah. I sometimes feel like, F um, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS, F um, the top headlines are always a murder, D you know. That that's because there's a high crime rate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Uhhuh. Yeah, really. That's true. We certainly get enough coverage. E I mean, we, we can get news, D you know, E I mean, there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twentyfour hours a day. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, often times. C So. Yeah. D Well, no, I guess we can end. Yeah, it's just whenever we're, F um. Yeah. Have you always gone until the recording? Uhhuh. I guess we're not supposed to <laughter>. . Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Interesting. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I guess I can just say I, it bothers me that I hear a lot about, F um, D you know, on the news that, D well, it seems like, A I don't know, some things are sensationalized or some things are, F um, D you know, you'll hear one report C and then you'll hear that it, D you know, they didn't, F um. Okay, what, F um, do you watch much T V C or, D you know. The news, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. D Now I also, I get it from all over. I watch the news every day, C and I ha, we have a news, D you know, we get the newspaper, and, F uh F um, magazines, an, anything. D You know, I'm, I read a lot, C so I get, F um, D you know, I'm, I'm really up on, F uh, current affairs. I get, D you know the news and, and everything. F Um, D well, I'm not getting an, no, I'm not getting any news magazines C but, F um, D you know, as, as I said, I do, it's, F uh, it's easy to keep up on current event, D you know on cert, D you know, especially when you, F um D you know, you get a paper every day. C And, F uh. F Uh, I don't know <laughter>. Is there anything missing? I, D you know, <laughter>. C And I don't know, D you know, what, what's, E I mean, what are we supposed to, F uh, compare it to <laughter> D you know, E I mean, the quality, F uh, whatever they tell you, D you know, I, F uh, <inhaling> I guess I, I, D you know, I'm satisfied. E I mean, I, F uh, D you know, they, they're supposedly covering everything that happens, C so <laughter> D you know. F Oh, really? Oh. D Well, F uh, sometimes it's such a, D you know, it's, it's so, F um, slight, D you know D like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper. C But most of the ti, the times I find that even if there are, D you know, they do have D like tremors out there, D you know, there'll be a small article in the paper about it. C But, F uh. F Oh, D well. That's what sells papers. <Laughter>. That's, F um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, D you know <laughter>. D You know, C but, F um, I don't know. I, I guess I'm satisfied, I don't, F uh. E I mean, what basis, D you know, of comparison do we have really? We don't get a, D you know. F Oh, yeah, I was going to. Sure, yeah. Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad <laughter>. It's all so negative, D you know. C But. D Well, we have to keep talking, I guess <laughter>. Oh. F Oh, is it really? D Well, yeah, I don't, I don't, F uh, <laughter>. I don't know, we're sup, I guess we're supposed to wait C or <laughter> I don't know. C Becau, I, D you know, D like one, F uh, D well, was it last week, we were supposed to talk about gardening F uh, <laughter> C and it was really funny, I, I, I mixed it, made the call, C and it happened to be my friend who lives <laughter> a few blocks away. Yeah, C and it was really. We were laughing, E I mean. C But, D you know, we don't really do any gardening, C so D like, that took like a minute C and then we just talked about, D you know, whatever, E I mean. <Laughter>. D You know, E I mean, some topics, really now, D you know, now, this topic, this is, E I mean, there really isn't much to say after <laughter> D you know, you, F uh, D you know, you, you tell the person what, F uh, news there, F uh, D you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from C and then, D you know, if it's, F uh, if they're satisfied, C and that's about it, really. It's hard to talk for five minutes on this <laughter>. D So, F um.
