Perhaps this connection, no, it still echoes. Okay, F um, I love it. F Uh, Do you work? C And have a family? Oh! <Laughter> I expect so. F Uh, D well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine. Oh <laughter>. F Um, <sigh> I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have. Oh. They have a T I plant in Texas, in Kingsport? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, great. What is, F uh, is a marsala wine a sweeter wine? Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. Huh. Oh. F Oh, C so it kind of browns C and then you put wine over it. Uhhuh. That sounds real good. Yeah. What do you serve with it? What do you serve with it? Uhhuh. That's what I do too <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh <laughter> that's what I've got. <laughter> I've got steamed broccoli down on mine <laughter>. No, it's great. I've got a good dessert recipe. F Uh, do you like angel food cake? I just break it up in a glass bowl, C and then I mix up, F uh, some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi, and some cool whip, C and I make a thickened blueberry sauce C and I layer it with, F uh, angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping. <Laughter>. It is, it's great. Uhhuh. Right. I know, I know what you mean. We don't eat desserts much any more. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, and pour that over it? That sounds great. It would be pretty. Right. Yeah. Right. That would be pretty. <Laughter> We've been fixing something lately that, D well we've been cooking a lot of, turkey breasts. Because it's low fat. C And I've been making a hot sandwich. I toast a piece of whole wheat bread, and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese C and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it, and pop it in the microwave. It is delicious. I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody. No. Yeah, it's real quick. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well ma, mix up a little, F uh, mayonnaise with some dijon mustard, and honey until it just, I mix it until it just tastes good to me. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and it's real good. C And it keeps in the refrigerator. F Oh, it keeps a long time. No, uhhuh, it keeps a long time. Oh. C And I put a little, F um, F oh, yogurt in it too. If I, just plain yogurt. It gives it a little tang. It makes a great sandwich. F Oh, are you <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, that's kind of hard. They'll eat fish? She'll eat fish. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh, that sounds good. <Laughter>. Right. I had a recipe from that, F um, INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO, that's a great salad in summertime. Do you, do you garden or not? Okay. it's just sliced tomatoes C and I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty. Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips, just over it, and some red onion slices, and just a little bit of, F um, basil, and then a little Italian dressing over it. C And everybody loves it C and it's so easy, C and it's delicious. Huhuh, it isn't. C And you can put some cucumber slices on too. <Laughter> I got it at the Checkbook Store. C And, it's got beaut, all these beautiful pictures, in there that are inspiring. <noise> It's going to say, F uh, edited by Charlotte Turgeon, editor of, I'm not french, LaRoute, Gastro LaMink the creative cooking course. <Laughter> I'm trying to see who it's published by, Ottenheimer, I've never heard of it. This edition is published by Bonanza Books. It's a big book C but it was not expensive. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. We do too. Yeah <noise>. That's right. I don't think it would. Uhhuh. I stir fried some the other night though. Some, F uh, beef and broccoli strips, it was good, C but it didn't have much beef in it <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, it just takes the time to cut everything up. Cook. Uhhuh <laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK, put out by the Junior League of Denver. Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues? they are great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. They are good, usually good aren't they? F Oh, is that right, what was that? <noise>. Uhhuh <noise>. You buy the canned baked, canned baked beans? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that sounds <noise>. Uhhuh. That sounds good. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Jot them down, F huh? Do you like to cook? I do too. It, it's kind of hard to find time sometimes C but, Yes. F Uh, I don't have a family, C but I, I usually work about fifty hours a week C and, by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal. That's, that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is, is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce, C so <laughter>. Where did you get your recipe for it? F Oh, okay. D Well mine actually came from the, F um, Texas Instruments Cafeteria. They, they, Yeah, we have, it's in Johnson City. C And, F um, the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes, D you know, D like once a month, they'll put out a recipe of the month. C And <static> they, they put this one out C and I tried it C and it was really good. Yeah, a little bit sweeter. C And it, F uh, it's a, it's a red wine. C And, F uh, I'm trying to think what else. I, I roll it in bread crumbs and, F uh, Parmesan cheese, C and, then I rub it with a little bit, I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil, and pour the wine sauce over it as, like the last twenty minutes, so that it gets just enough flavor. Right. <Cough>. C And, it's really easy too C so, What do you use? Huh? I like to serve, F um, a wild rice with it. <Laughter> This is really neat. C And, I, we're big broccoli fans. <Cough> D Well, I just, I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that. F Oh, what? Yes. Uhhuh. Wow. What time should we be there? <laughter>. That sounds wonderful <cough>. I love desserts, C but since there's only two of us, it's really, I, I try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that, we'd like too much and eat too much <laughter>. C But I, I guess one that, that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile, C and it's, it's called a fruit pizza. C And you take a, F uh, sugar cookie, F uh, recipe, and, and spread it out on a pizza pan. C So you make it like a pizza crust, C and then you, you bake that C and then you, F um, take things like kiwi, and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want C and you mix that with, F um, <cough> E excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice C and I can't remember what else is in it C and you make kind of a glaze, C and then you layer your fresh fruit on that. Yeah. It is really good, C and it, it's real light C and it, depending on the fruit you use it's, D you know, it's real colorful. Especially with D like the kiwi and the strawberries. C So, C but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream <laughter> <cough> <static>. <Static>. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's just so much better for you. Uhhuh. Oh! That sounds great. <Cough>. No, C and that's some, that's something that just, D you know, it doesn't take a long time to fix, it's really good, C and it's really good for you. C And we eat out a lot C and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out, C and I wish I had something a little bit different, to just <noise> <<sounds like she snaps her fingers>> zap together. <Cough>. Uhhuh. I was going to say, do you just mix it to taste? Okay. How long, does it keep, do you, D well you wouldn't have to make, Yeah, C and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even. <Cough> I'm sorry I keep coughing. I've had a bad cold. Plain? Plain yogurt? I'll bet that is really good. Man, I'm going to have to think of that. We're getting company tonight, C and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian. C So, we're going to, I think we'll try to do something a little bit, we might try to, to, F um, to grill some flounder or salmon steaks. Yeah. C And, I usually, when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce C and, F um, definitely go with, it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, to make up for the lack of meat. No we don't, our next door neighbors do C and some, a lot of times they'll give us something. Yeah. Oh! Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. That's what I was just thinking, it doesn't sound like it, it would be hard at all. where did you get, where did you get this cook book? Really! <Cough>. <Laughter>. I'll might have to visit the State Book Store. I haven't either. Okay. D Well, the ones that I've been, I've been wanting to get, F um, I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTYFIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN, and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTYFIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA, I've been, I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken, C and we do eat a lot of pasta. D So, we, we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be, to do without red meat. D You know, we don't have that much of it now. As long as we have plenty of vegetables, and lots of chicken. Yeah, I've got a, I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to. We used to stir fry a lot, especially, F um, a lot of chicken and, and a lot of rice dishes. Yeah. C But usually if I'm, if I'm, if I take a day off or on the weekend especially, I try to cook, real, real food. C And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead. C So that we can have those to enjoy. D So, Uhhuh. Yes. Cause, we have some, some local ones. C And we have a share alike column in the paper, where people, D you know, write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe, C and that's where I get a lot of my recipes. Yes. C And I got, I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time. It's, F uh, it's a baked bean recipe. C And, you mix baked beans and Lima beans C and, F uh, let's see, I guess, Yeah. Just mix the canned beans together, and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup, D you know, C and, C and you just bake it. C And it's just, it's like a, a spicier baked bean dish. C And, you can add hamburger if you want, to give it a little more body. C So, I, I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find, find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it. C So, I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse. C But, it's been,
