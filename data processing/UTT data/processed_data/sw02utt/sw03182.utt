Do you have any hobbies? What are yours? F Ooh, how great. F Oh, F uh, ceramic painting. The china more. How did you ever get into that? That sounds so interesting. How marvel, I, D Now, do you do it just for yourself, C or do you do it to give as gifts, C or do you actually sell it? F Oh, that sounds mar, D now, do you work outside of the home? You've just retired. F Oh, F oh, what a <laughter> great hobby <laughter>. I, Don't retire. D Well, D see, I don't, I never, F uh, returned to work for the p, I have stayed home for about the last nine years. We've transferred around, C and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake, F uh, on Lake Erie. C So the lake life appealed to me, C and my husband's working C and he left it up to me if I worked or not. C So, in my spare time, I love to sew. There aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing, C but I do make all my own clothes C and we recently purchased a new home, C so I enjoy <breathing> doing my, F uh, toppers for my window applications and things like that. C But, F uh, just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby, yours sounds great <laughter>. That is excellent. We're in the sub, I'm in the suburb of Cleveland C and I'm about, F uh, fifteen miles, probably, from downtown Cleveland, something like that. C And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie C and prior to this, we were fifty miles west from here. C So we were right on the lake. C And Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard <laughter>. C And you do find people, F uh, into the crafts and the things that, F uh, various things for spare time, C but, I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting C and I'm just intrigued with it. Right, where you're getting into the delicate work. D Now, do you, where did you first get your lessons from? Through a, F uh, an adult ed, or strictly a china type, F Oh, how marvelous. F Oh, C and it's so nice, It must be so nice for you, now that you're retired. F Oh, isn't that great. C And you'll probably really, F uh, re, regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a, a class again. Yes, I do. China painting and ceramics. I enjoy it. Uhhuh <<faint>>. I enjoy the china more. C And now that I have my eyes, <laughter> corrected to the point that I can see <breathing> the delicate part of china painting, I do enjoy it. My husband <breathing> kept begging me, C and he's been dead now for twenty years, C so you understand that this was a long time ago. C But he finally brought me the china, the book, the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons. C And I said I'll do it for three months C and if I don't like it, that's it. D Well, I painted <laughter> an awful lot until his death, which was several years. C And it has just been the most relaxing, enjoyable <breathing>, selfsatisfying thing I've had. I, I have sold quite a bit. I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home <breathing>, C and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it. Uhhuh. I have just retired. Yes. No, it's not, <Laughter> It's a great hobby, C but don't retire <laughter>. F Oh, F Oh, have, D well, Wow. F Oh, uhhuh. <Laughter> D Well, my sister is the seamstress of the two of us. C And, C but she doesn't china paint C so we both have our expertise side. What part of Ohio are you in? F Oh, what's that, If you ever start, be sure and start with a large piece that you can, E I mean a large flat plate. F Um, that way you can get the feel of, you're not cramped on these smaller objects. That's right. In Abilene, Texas. She just taught china painting. Uhhuh, C and, Then, then we had so much fun there, I had a friend from Albany, which is about thirtysix miles away, C and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home, because she did our firing for us, C and she would help us C and we bought lots of equipment from her, supplies C and it was just such a delightful time. C And then after I, Beg pardon? I <breathing> have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death. C So I have put it aside for a little while, C but I'm, I have just found me an instructor to get started again, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Of course, I just have one beautiful p, with peonies, F uh, umbrella stand, C and I have two daughters C and they're both,
