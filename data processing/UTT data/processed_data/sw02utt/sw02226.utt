F Uh, books. Mainly I read the Bible these days. Good, that's great to hear. F Uh, C and Christian literature. F Uh, I've kind of, I used to read a lot of, F uh, novels, C but it seems as though if you really want to set a t, side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever, F uh, that pretty well takes up your time for reading. C And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible <laughter> in my heart C and he really has. It's getting, to where a just really want to read it. Do you? Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's? F Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, F uh, F uh, I forget the t, the other, D well he, F uh, he's also written a lot of children, how old is your daughter. Five, okay, he's written some children's books as well C and they're all spiritually, F uh, oriented, yeah. Frank E Peretti, P E R E T T I. Uhhuh. Yeah, do C because, F uh, I love to read his, his, F uh, children's books just <static> <laughter>, Yeah, F oh, they're good, they're great. C And it's D like, F uh, F uh, usually about a family of, F uh, archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into, D like, F uh, F uh, digging in old ruins, and running across, D like, F uh, the old gods and things. Yeah, it is. It's real exciting. C And it also teaches them spiritual warfare D you know, C so, Uhhuh. D Well, it's hard for me. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. I know it, C and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, that's right. Uhhuh, yeah, I've read a lot of his, too. Yeah. Can't put them down. Uhhuh, yeah. F Uh, there's another guy. F Oh, what can, what is his name <lipsmack>. F Oh, durn <laughter>, you would, D well D you know when you're recording you can't re, remem, F Uh, F oh, Dean, F uh, Kratz, or Kranz C or, Y, who? F Uh, no, it's a guy. C And he, he writes the same thing, though. It's that real, gruesome <laughter>, horror stories. Yeah. Koontz. F Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that. Yeah, F uh, Uhhuh. I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though. It seems like it's all the <breathing>, did you ever read the, F uh, F uh, F oh, it's one of his first books, THE STAND. I know it. C And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that, E I mean. D You know, that, Uhhuh. I love that book, though. I thought it was great. F Ooh, yes <laughter>. F Oh, those hedges when they started moving. Whenever they <laughter>, they made that into a movie, I was thinking F oh, my gosh if they show that, I'll just die. For some reason that scared me more than anything. Yeah. Uhhuh. C And that was a pretty scary movie, too. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's right. Yeah, that's true. I liked IT as well. That's, another big fat one. <Laughter>. Yeah, except it broke my heart. <Laughter> I'm a dog lover. <Laughter>. No, it was, F uh, What? F Oh, yeah. I've read that one, too. He's written a lot of books. Boy, he just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job. That's right. That one about the Gypsies, or that, hunger C or, s, F uh, Yeah, Richard Bachman. Yeah, he's so prolific. F Oh, I know it. C And I have gone back C and, after I, I graduated, I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, F uh, Once you can get into the language, D you know, the l, It's D like, it's English, C but it's not the same English they speak today. C So it's kind of hard to keep, D you know, at it, C but their worthwhile. Literature? Yeah, me, too. Uhhuh. Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself. F Uh, wasn't that Jane Ehre? No, he wrote JANE EHRE, too <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, uhhuh. Right, right. That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen, because they'll take a classic and, and, F uh, televise it D you know, put it into a viewing format, more or less. Uhhuh. Do you? D Well, I can imagine. Yeah, yeah me, too. D Well, I think we've accomplished five minutes C so, <Laughter>. It's good talking to you. Byebye. Yes. That's very good. I do, too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, it does. It, That's good. That's good. It, it, <throat_clearing> it's, F uh, it's hard for me to find time, also, to read. F Uh, a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that for, D you know, because I don't have a lot of time, C but when I do get to sit down and, and read, I like to read the Bible C and I like to read, I read to my daughter a lot, too. C And, F uh, I like to read, D you know, Bi, I have Bible storybooks C so I like reading those to her C and she really enjoys those. C So that's good. C And it, C and it's kind of short because we don't, woe don't have a lot of time, to, to read, C so, it's real enjoyable. For both of us. Frank E <whispering>, no I guess I haven't. Five. F Oh, really? What's his name again? Peretti <whispering>, Frank E Peretti <whispering>. I have to look for those. Just to read them. D Well, that's good. That's good. Uhhuh. Oh <breathing>. Yeah. F Oh, that sounds pretty neat. F Oh, I'll have to look for those. <Sniffing> Right. D Well, that's neat. D Well, I <throat_clearing>, I have a, my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection C and I like that because it's a, it's real easy to, F uh, follow for her, D you know, F uh, D gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd <laughter> never understand any of it. That's right <laughter>. It is, it is real hard to, to follow and understand, C and, F uh, I've got a Bible that, F uh, has a little bit of a, F uh, <breathing> a glossary in the back C and it helps explain who people are. That's, that's about the hardest thing is, who's related to who <laughter>. Yeah. Yes. Yes, it sure is, C but, C but it is good reading C and it's good for us, and <sniffing> and everything. I really do enjoy it. C But, F uh, <lipsmack> I also, C but then on the other extreme I like to read, F uh, F uh, I guess ho, I don't know, horror, Steven King type books. The, C and I, I like that, that's good fun reading. No you can't, you really can't. They are good C and F ooh they just, they're just so suspenseful. I really do enjoy his. I know <laughter>. Judith Krantz? Judith Krantz. I know her. F Oh, okay. Oh. Ooh. Yeah. That's good. <Breathing> Yeah, F oh, I think I know who you're talking about. F Uh, I've seen, I don't think I can pronounce it either, C but <laughter>. Yeah, I'm in a book club C and I think I've seen his books in there <throat_clearing>. I've never read any of his. C But they're real, <Sniffing>. Yes. That, F oh, that long thing. Yeah, they do kind of follow or, Are similar. Yeah, it really was, C and I loved THE SHINING. That was, that was my favorite. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, that is, he just brings stuff alive, D you know. You could just visualize everything. That's, Yeah, I think they did a pretty good job, C but <throat_clearing>, they didn't follow it exactly, C but they did give it, D you know, do it justice. C But, F uh, most of the time they don't with, when, follow books very well <sniffing> when they make them into movies <child_talking>. Yeah, yeah, F uh, I did, too. Yeah. Yeah, that was good. I liked, F uh, I also liked, F uh, CUJO. Did you read that one? C And, Yeah, Me, too <laughter>. C And then, F uh, <throat_clearing> NIGHT STAND, is that NIGHT, DEAD, DEAD ZONE. That's one I liked. DEAD ZONE. That was a, That was a real good one. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> I know it. Right, C and then he has some under, F uh, another name. That he's written. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, I think his name was Bachman. He wrote under the name of Bachman. Yeah. He is really interesting. Yeah <breathing>. F Ooh, I wish I could do that <laughter>. Uhhuh. I do, too. I love old, good old, Yeah <laughter>. Right. That's true, C but I, That's, that was one of my favorite subjects in school was, F uh literature. I used to love those old, good, good old books. <Sniffing> I didn't mind doing that at all <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. I liked, F uh, <throat_clearing> F oh, D gosh why can't I think of their names, F uh, <lipsmack> <breathing>, shoot, the one that wrote, F uh, WUTHERING HEIGHTS. No that was another one. Yeah, yeah. F Uh, D well, you know who I'm talking about <laughter>. Yeah, those are good old good old books and classics, that's right. Sure is neat <<faint>>. Yeah. Right. Right. A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays. I know it's, it's really hard for me. I work two jobs and F uh, have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school, myself, C so it's, it's hard for me to sit down and read, C but when I do I just, just love it. <Sneezing>.
