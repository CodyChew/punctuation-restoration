Okay. I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute. <<Takes a deep breath>> D Well, credit cards, A boy, that's an easy topic, isn't it <laughter>. F Oh, yes, yes. I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them. Uhhuh <noise>. D Well, I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want <laughter>. D You know not need, want. There's a big difference there. C But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline. Uhhuh. F Oh, it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way <<Voices>>. At least that's for me. Yeah. C But yeah, I've, I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience C and A kind of knock on wood I haven't yet, not bad. D You know, I just, I'm just shocked at the end of the month, to see what damage I have did, C but <laughter>, I try to keep it pretty reasonable. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. C And then they have bad drawbacks, too. E I mean high interest, it's like paying twice. Yes, C so,. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, yes. F Uh, we used to have, D you know, D like several, C but right now, we're just more or less at American Express, D you know, C and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in. Yeah. Pay fifteen, yeah. Yes, I know, yeah. C And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time. It sure does. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah. D Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. C And maybe we'll get to talk again. Okay, byebye. Okay. Okay. Ye, Yes, it is <laughter>. It's one we all hold dear and near, I'm sure. Yeah, most of mine's been pretty good, although I'm, I guess I'm like a lot of other people, now, I'm trying to, to pay off my credit cards C and, C and, F uh, I've done pretty good at it. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, there is a big difference <<Voices>>. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, F oh yeah, I, I do that, I do that, C but the rest, like I said, the rest of them I've been trying to, to pay off and, F uh, get back on a cash basis, except for gas. It's too easy to, to run into the gas station. C And,. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. D So. Yeah, D well that's, <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I've been pretty lucky in that respect. I don't charge, like I say, I've, I been trying to, to not charge except for emergencies. C And, F uh, C so, C but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards. There's, D you know, they have, F uh, wonderful features, they're there when you need them. D You know, like in emergencies, or whatever. Yeah. It's, it's awfully easy. That's true, that's true, I try to, I did switch to one, F uh, sponsored by the credit union, though. That seems to be a pretty low interest. D Yeah, compared to some of the other ones. C And you don't have an annual fee there, C and that helps. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it instead of saying, D well, I'll just pay on it this month C and <laughter>, Yeah. Takes a long time, that's right. C And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax that's, D you know. Of course it's been going down for a number of years, C but this is the last year you can take anything. C So. D So. D Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. Okay. Byebye.
