Think about, F uh, taxes. You spend what you have C and, Yeah, I think that, the general idea is to s, D you know, spend, F uh, during a time of recession that, D you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy, C but they're running under the assump, D you know, the way they're running it now, they're h, D you know, running it under a deficit spending, D you know, while we're not under a recession, C so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running, C so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, <breathing> keep spending, keep going into debt, you're not going to payoff what you owe, C but, <sniffing> C so, I guess the, the question was more like, F uh, do you get what you pay f, D you know, get what you pay for. Yeah. <laughter> There's, Uhhuh. I agree with that. I guess, I'm, I'm a student right now C and I don't make a whole lot of money C and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, F uh, compared to what I get, because I, D you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school C and, F uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, C so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, D you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long. My parents, I guess, h, h, however, have contributed to that, D you know, for the education side of it and everything, C but, F uh, I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a, Yeah, I am <laughter>. I need it, too, otherwise, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. More taxes you pay. Uhhuh. Isn't, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. D Well isn't, Uhhuh, there's a lot, D yeah, lot of hidden taxes. Uhhuh. The taxes that people don't think about that, yeah, the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess. Uhhuh. There was that, which can, was it Jerry Brown, one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a f, I think a flat percentage, something like that. Uhhuh. Right. Exactly. That's, because until, D like eight, <Laughter>. Up until, D like, eightyfive or something was the, D Well, I think they're a necessary evil. F Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, F uh, businesses operate on C and that is, F uh you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in. D Well, I, <breathing> it just depends. F Uh, F uh, roads are very expensive, F uh, commodity and so is, F uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, F uh, D you know, they need to make a living. C So <laughter>, I think for, for, for many years, F uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, F uh, to a great extent, public servants F uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society. C But, F uh, then again, F uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, F uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments. F Uh, you're very fortunate. <Laughter>. We just try not to pay any more in than we have to, F uh, we pay in a substantial amount. F Uh, We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that, F uh, sometimes, F uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax. C And progressive tax, I think, F uh, does not give people incentive to make more money, C and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay. It should be, I think, a flat percentage C and, F uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount. F Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, F uh, nineteen ninety, ninetyone, whatever, nineteen ninetyone F uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else, C and I totaled them all up C and basically, F uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax. D Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, F uh, taxes on different things. C But, D you know, there's f, there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, F uh, like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax. You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank. C But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes. <Sniffing>. Yeah <<faint>>, if you impl, implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, F uh, to make more money C and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, A now this is just my opinion, okay, F uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes. C And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs. C And so, Based on that, who do you think you're talking to, you're talking to an employer. <Laughter>.
