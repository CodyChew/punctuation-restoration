How would you go about organizing a family reunion? F Oh, gee. F Oh, my. Uhhuh. Yes. With all of you living so close together. Oh. D Well, I come from a very small family. C And we planned a family reunion this spring. F Uh, where we are from Texas C and my family is from Ohio C and we met in Florida. C So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together. C So that's all the family, C so planning our family reunio, reunion was very easy <laughter>, you know. Yeah, D well, we had a wonderful tim, D Well, a, for, I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama. C So whenever I think of family reunions, my family, D like, got together almost every week. C And there would be like thirty people. C So people talk about, D you know, big family reunions C and I think, D like I have a friend who just went to, D like, Wyoming to some big ranch, D you know, where D like there were four hundred people for their family reunion. C And I, C so E I mean, how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my <noise> relatives. C Because I, since I came from, my father has, F uh, five sisters and two brothers C and my mother has four brothers and two sisters. C So I ca, both of my parents had big families, C and we always wer, we always got together, just always. Now it's different because I live here C and I, D you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can C but it's real different. C And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting. Right. E I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's C and, D you know, like I said there would be thirty, D you know, thirty people, C and everyone would just bring things C and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook. C And i, Uhhuh. Yeah, I guess so. It really sounds like it was fun.
