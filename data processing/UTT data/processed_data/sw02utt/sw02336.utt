Okay, D so what kind of car are you thinking about getting? D Well, when you decide to. Uhhuh. C So you like the Ford? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's the, this, the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact, C and, F uh, I loved it, I really did. C But, F uh, F um, I finally decided to go check out what the, F uh, what the, F uh, foreign cars were. C So I bought myself a, a, a Nissan a two forty S X. C But even though I love the car I've got now, I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American, I always have, up until now. I just for one time decided to go outside. C So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, Ford's done a real good job in the last, F uh, D say, ten years or at least the last five to te, six years, so, of really turning around their, F um, quality, I think, F um. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, yeah, those were not good cars. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D You know, the only thing I'm looking, at right now, F um, I just, I just bought, D you know, the Nissan that I've got about, F uh, D say, nine months ago, I guess it was <throat_clearing>. D So the only thing that, that would get me to change cars right now would be if, D see, at the moment I'm single, C and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it. C But, F uh, I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, D you know. F Uh, cars are too expensive right now to, F uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years, D you know it's Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's, F uh, I went to a, a car show down here about, F uh, about two weeks ago, C and, F um, D you know, of course they had the normal, the Ford, the, the Chevrolet, that stuff. C But then you started looking at the, F uh, F uh, they had Ferrari there, they had, F uh, B M W and all these other kinds of cars. C And Ferrari didn't even let you near the car, E I mean, they were, that's how expensive they were. C And then you saw, F uh, hundred thousand dollar cars, you saw eighty thousand dollar cars, C and even, even though I, I, I do enjoy cars, I enjoy, F um, driving them, I enjoy, F uh, riding in them and everything, C but, I can't see buying, E or paying more for a car than I would for a house, D you know. That doesn't seem likely. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think so. That's happened to me once, D So, F uh, Yeah, D like, F uh, I think the one time I did it was on Sau, the Mid, the Mid East, the crisis out there. That was, had a great conversation, C but, F uh, then they came off and <laughter> told us we couldn't do it any more. C So. Yeah. You too. Byebye. D Well, none at the moment <laughter>. <Laughter> No, no, no. I currently drive a, a Ford Taurus. C And I would ima, I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car, a new car, I will go with the Taurus or something similar, F uh, in that regard. Absolutely. I have had it for about two years now C and it's F uh, <inhaling> it's everything it's supposed to be. F Uh, I haven't had a minutes trouble with it C and, F uh, the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus, C but I still feel a little, even after two years, I still feel uncomfortable driving it, because I had a Honda before that C and so it's a little bit larger. C But that's the only, the only difference that I see, really. C But I would, my, my criteria would be, at the moment it would be, F uh, American, F uh, personally, C an, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, my wife drives a, still has a, a Honda Accord, C and it's a very, it's an excellent automobile. And, F uh, but, D you know, price and so forth, I'm not a real car fan. D So, I, I, I do not, F uh, opt for, F uh, something that would be, <breathing> D you know, expensive D you know, I want, I want something that's serviceable, serviceable, something that I can use C and, F uh, C and I, C and with the Taurus, I have a Taurus, F uh, L X, C and it's, D you know, you're talking when you think about price, it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines. C And as I said, as far I'm concerned, it, it has been extremely, F uh, F uh, serviceable and everything I wanted. Uhhuh. F Oh, I think so too. D Now, I, D you know, in travel and renting automobiles F uh, in, I've driven, D you know, Chevrolet automobiles and so for, and Dodge, C and I, if it's Chevrolet, I just will not touch it. F Uh, I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus. I purchased a, <breathing> a Chevy, F um, Citation. C And, F uh, I was ready to get rid of it <laughter> two months after I bought it, C And, F uh, C so I, I shopped around, C and I would, I probably, if I had thought I, F uh, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, F uh, F uh, an Accord or even a, a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota, C and, F uh, C but it was just, I had, I have a friend who, F uh, has a, F uh, an auto shop, C and he purchased one of the first Sables that was, F uh, manufactured for his wife, a Sable station wagon, C and he just absolutely swore by it. C And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, D you know, comparable, comparably equipped, D you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio, and all these other things F uh, it was just, there was no, there was no comparison. F Uh, the only thing that I find, D you know, if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride. F Uh, not, F uh, that's about the only thing I find, D you know, disadvantageous to it. C But, my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something that's serviceable, C and I, D you know, I drive around a lot, C but, F uh, C and it's, D you know, it's very comfortable on the highway. I can drive for, D you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way. C But those are my criteria, C and I, I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again, C and if there's something out there that, F uh, is comparable to what I have now, I'll go ahead and get it. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> I, yeah. In our parking lots, F uh, two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars. F Uh, I, I can't remember what the name is. It's the thirtyfive or forty thousand dollar one, whatever it is, C and it looked, it resembled a Mazaratti <<name of car>> very, very closely. C And <throat_clearing> it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth, C but to pay that much money for an automobile, F uh, is just, I can't, I can't conceive of doing that <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's true. D Well, The difference there is, D too, F uh, is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving. I never have been, since, D you know, my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen. C So I've never really cared. D Now, what I was, D you know, before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do little sports car racing. I never, it was never my own car it was always someone else's. C And that sort of thing I enjoy, C but to go out and drive, F uh, never has really been, had any appeal to me in that regard. D So <inhaling>. D Well I guess we've discussed that enough don't you think. We won't, we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, F uh, system to shut us off, F uh, tonight. That's happened to me almost every time I've, <Laughter>. D Well, it's very easy when you get a top, you get on a topic that, D you know, you enjoy. F Oh, yeah. D Well I was talking to a lady last evening, C and we were talking about fishing, C and, F uh, we were cut off, D well, we were told to quit. Okay. D Well, you have a pleasant evening. Take care. Goodbye.
