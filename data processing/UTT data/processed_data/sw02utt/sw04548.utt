D Well, D actually, F uh, I, I don't think I'm in the, F uh, majority of, in, in Texas I don't think I agree with, No. F Uh, I wouldn't say that. I think I would have said that a few years ago. When I was younger I thought it was, F uh, <sniffing> a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, F uh, capital punishment C but, F um, F uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion. I'm not thoroughly opposed to it. I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment C but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I certainly don't, F uh, advocate turning people like that loose. I'm not sure executing them, F uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail, C but, F uh, <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. That, that's a factor. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I, the cost is something C but it's, C but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, dealing with crime C and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, F uh, none of them have capital punishment C and they they don't have a crime problem either. No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France C and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either <throat_clearing> C and they don't have the crime problems we do. I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two. I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, F uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, F uh, F uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing C and the, that, that bothers me. C But it, C but, F uh, <Throat_clearing>. Huh. Yeah. Huh. D Well D actually I, wha, the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, F uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else. I think it just becomes a, F uh, <throat_clearing> symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians C so I would like for it to be settled once for all and, F uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed, F uh, F uh, Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country. Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that. I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around. F Uh, I guess I'm, I'm, my view of <sniffing>, F uh, my, I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, F uh, that, F uh, F uh, costs and other factors justify, F uh, F uh, executing people. Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, F uh, <sniffing> F uh, than anything else C and, F uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered C and, F uh <Sniffing> I can imagine that, F uh, F uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case. <Baby>. F Oh really. You don't believe in it? <Baby>. Yeah. <Laughter> You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with. She has very, very black and white <baby> opinions, D you know. There's no gray in her opinions, D you know. She, she probably would agree more with you C but, C but I don't know. I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the <baby> opportunity to get out and do it again. I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family C but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done. C And we see that more and more. D Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl D you know, that's fourteen years old. What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult. Yeah. No it doesn't C but, it costs less. C And, yeah, to me it is. E I mean, I work and I pay my taxes C and I lived out in Texas for a little while C and they're C and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia <baby>. E I mean you guys are, are a lot more, F uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia. C But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part. If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine. C But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues <laughter> then I don't like you very much anymore. <Noise>. F Oh, really. Yeah. You might be right. E I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, D you know, I would never in a million years want that job C but I do believe it's necessary C and I, On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing C and I couldn't pull the switch C but, F uh, Yeah. Right. <Baby>. Uhhuh. What what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing <baby>? <Baby>. Yeah. F Oh, gosh <baby>. <Baby> F Oh yes, if it ever touched my fam,
