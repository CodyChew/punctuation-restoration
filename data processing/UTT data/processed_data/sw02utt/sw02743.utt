Okay. Hi Norma. Have you taken anything back lately, F uh, that you've bought? D Well why? Very good. Good. D Well wh, do you think that, F uh, consumer goods, goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality? I do too. I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time, C but I don't, I, I believe that they're better now, D you know, wh, however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixtythree thousand miles on it. <Laughter> C And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at, F uh, on one side. No, I had moved away. I had taken the first one back. I didn't think that it heated well enough. It never did get anything but just moderately warm, took it back C and, F uh, the people told me D well that's the way it's supposed to be C and I fell for it C and, F uh, when I got this one it did, a lit, it heated a little bit warmer C and then after one year it started heating only on one side. <Laughter> Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year. D Now I figure th, F uh, anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an iron that will last a long time, C and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last. D Well without even any question, C but I think it was the store. WalMart. Yes <laughter>. C And, F uh, D well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes? That was poor quality, I think. I wondered if it weren't expensive, C and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever. Yes. You spent that much on your dresses? You're really divulging very personal information. F Oh, of course, I do too. D Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes. C And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you. You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on it all the time. Bye, bye. Hi. D Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants. Shrubbery, that were guaranteed C and we had no problem with it. We got our mo, got our money back. D Well, <<pause>> I believe they're better. I think so. I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy. Electrical appliances I think are pretty good, r, reliable. Right <laughter>. F Oh, did you return it? No, uhhuh. Huh, C so C either you or your husband can be warm but not both <laughter>. Oh. No, huhuh. Did they replace it? Uhhuh. WalMart, I was going to say, it must have been WalMart. <Laughter>. I haven't bought any new clo, D well the last thing I bought was a dress last Summer. C And the buttons turned on it ove, over the winter. The buttons tarnished slightly C and I have not gone back about it. I think it is too, C and it was an expensive dress. Yes it was. That's right, that's what I think too. C And one belt loop, the wo, F uh, D you know, D like the chain link, chain belt loop half of it raveled out. C And that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress C and it was, I think, over a hundred dollars. Yeah, I don't usually, C but I did that one. <Laughter> C But I think it should have been better than that, for that money, is what I mean. <Breathing> <laughter> Okay, I think so. Good talking to you too, I've enjoyed it <laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, we'll be talking to you later. Bye, bye.
