Okay. Where do you enjoy dining out? Yes, do you have children? F Uh. Yeah, that makes a difference, doesn't it. <Laughter> What area of the country do you live in? Yes, I am, too. C But, I did, too. I'm from the Dayton area. Oh. Uhhuh. That's right. Yes. When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids, C and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals C and then that way they can get their burgers and fries C and we can have a salad bar C so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's, because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens, Right, that's right, I know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. D Well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places? Uhhuh. F Oh, we are Little Caesar fans here that's where we always go, Yes, we like Grandy's, too. Oh. Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out, or a big meal? Where do you go for steaks? Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line? That's where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there, C and when we have something to celebrate, we head to Houston's. They don't take reservations, C and you wind up waiting about an hour C but the food is good, C and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink, unless you get there at five o'clock, then you can go right through. C But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks, C so, that's our nice place to go. We don't usually take the kids when we go there, Yeah. Right, That's right. Yeah, that's the way with my husband. He's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends, C and I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere, C so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend. Right. Yes. Uhhuh. Right. Yep. F Oh, I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap. F Uh, we have four, C but most of them are gone now C so there, there might be, C but we were taking, D you know, F uh, four, five and six people out <laughter>. Yes. I'm in Texas. C And we live, we lived in Ohio prior to this. <Laughter>. F Uh, we were up near Cleveland. Yeah, F uh, C but I look for service even at the quickie places type things. F Uh, I don't like to go to the drivethrus because sometimes they get your order wrong C and then you're stuck C and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave C so I really don't like the drivethrus that much. I, I like to go and eat there. C But I would say service, F uh, atmosphere, and whether the food is good, C and on going out, I like steaks. C So, we try to hit those places when we can. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Uh, yeah, C and, in, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and WalMart are their main <laughter>. That's what you find, right, My husband likes, F uh, Dairy Queens. He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs, I guess, C so he's a fan of, of Dairy Queen, C and, C and we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although I'm not that excited about it. C But we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place C but yet I hate to cook food at home C so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe. C Or we eat junk food at home F uh, now my husba, F Oh, we'll go to them all. We sort of take turns. C And we, F uh I sort of favor the ones, if I have a coupon we can go there C and if not we can't, because it's cheaper C so mine is, monetarily, I guess strongly monetarily based. F Uh, we'll go get pizza and, F uh, at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's. Right. C But it's just a lot cheaper than, than Domino's, C so that's. We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say. McDonald's, F uh, we've sort of been off of that for a while C and no particular reason, C and I, maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there C and she never wanted us to show up there C so, I don't, we don't go there that much. A nice meal, F oh, It's usually when we're out of town C and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined C so it's really not in town. No. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. C But D well, we don't go out that much, I gue, D well, I guess we do go out without kids. We're usually picking things up quickly, though we just don't dwell on food too much, C and, F uh, with my husband traveling he can get all he needs <laughter> of that during the week going to those places C so, it doesn't really matter to him. He'd probably just like to stay home. <Laughter>. D Well, I think, I, I never have liked to cook food, C but I think it all began eating out when we had, F uh, the boys in, in different, F uh, baseball on baseball tea, it was mainly baseball teams C and my husband would coach, C so we were never home at the same time. I'm not one that's going to fix, D you know, the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there. If there not there in between five and six, D well, then I guess we don't eat today, *sp C or you go <laughter> D you know you fend for yourself. You go somewhere else. C So that, D you know, that really snowballed when we got down here, when I started to sub, make money, I went F Oh, D well, I'll just sub to, *slash error
