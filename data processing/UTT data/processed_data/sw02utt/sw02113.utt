F Uh, the last movie that I saw, I, I don't go to that many C so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see, C but, F uh, it was AWAKENINGS with, F uh, Robin Williams and, F uh, Peter DeNiro. Have you seen it. It is. I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro. He is one of the best actors I've ever seen. It's, there's a point where, the, F uh, the show is about these, F uh, catatonic type people that, this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less, C but it wears off. C And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, D you know, F uh, it starts off with like a tic, C and then it gets to where he can't, D you know, control his movements at all. C And it was just so realistic. The way, D you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor. No, it was very serious, very se, He's good, he's, he's talented, boy, he is. I know, me too. C But, F uh, D well, what was that show, F um, <barking> Gar, F uh, Garf, I want to say Garfield C but that wasn't it. Yeah, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. He wasn't always funny in that show, was he. I did too. That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part <barking>. Yeah, right. D Well what have you seen? F Oh, I saw it. Yes, the whole way <laughter>. <Laughter> Where did you cry. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah, yeah. I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed <laughter>. F Oh, th, when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him. C And then he, F uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, D you know <barking>. C And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone. You can tell I'm an animal lover, you can hear my dog <barking>. Yeah. It was a beautiful story, it really was. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, I thought it was awful, and so graphic, E I mean I hadn't even imagined it, D you know. I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo. F Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, F uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie. Of course they raise them now, D you know, to eat. C But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that. No it wasn't <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, really. C And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, D you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path, C and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing. I know. Yeah, yeah. F Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, F uh, of, of that movie. It was, they tried to keep it, D you know, as very close to real. E I mean D like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes C and, F uh, they had to teach a wolf how to, to howl. That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves <barking>. Yeah, what, they just don't howl that much anymore. I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off C and that's all they'd have to do <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I think we've made it. I don't know, is it five or three. I'm not either. Okay, me too. D Well thank you. Yeah, you too. Bye, bye. Okay. Yes, uhhuh. No unfortunately I haven't, I heard it's really good, C but. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What does, F uh, is Robby, Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it? F Oh how does he do serious. I've only seen him in funny stuff C and so. Yeah, F uh, GARP, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. I didn't read, see the, the movie, I read the book C but I, Yeah, in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it C so. Yeah. I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES. Good, we've both seen one <laughter>. Did you cry through it? It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice, C but each was about half an hour long, D so. F Um, let's see, when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried. F Um, I cried the first time when the, F um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him. C And, F uh, I think from there on, all the way through the movie. Let's see what else did it. F Um, what other parts. I can't remember any of the other parts right off now. We, I don't remember when the horse got killed. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> Unfortunately we don't have any animals, C so, F uh. It, there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie. What did you think about the buffalo scenes. That was, Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh. Uhhuh, yeah, it's not, Uhhuh, D well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in. F Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful, D like that was great. C And there were so many of them. I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place. D So that was pretty. Yeah. I wonder how they kept up with them, though, it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast. I guess they graze, though, that wouldn't be a problem. No, huhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. I guess they're just not domesticated, C or, C or, F Uh. <Laughter> That'll teach them in a couple minutes, F huh. D Well that's funny. F Oh is that five minutes, is that, Okay, F oh, I'm not sure. Okay, D well I think we're, we're, we've done okay, though. D Well thank you for calling. C And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late, Bye, bye.
