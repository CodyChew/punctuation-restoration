Okay, do you subscribe to magazines yourself? F Oh, I see. I get, F uh, MCCALL'S. Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest. C And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to re, go back to work <laughter>. What I enjoy about staying home. C And, F uh, I read magazines mainly because they're fast C and if I want to relax while I watch T V, <beep> of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once, C and, F uh, I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S. C And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject. Uhhuh. C And then you stopped them all. I find that, F uh, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular C and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING. GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when, F uh, when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, D you know. I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with F uh, on a general basis, C and we travel a lot C so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various D you know, different ones. C And I get into, F uh, newspapers, C so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am. I'm, re, read it fast and put it down <laughter>. Right. D Well, That's what I do. You clip recipes C and you save them forever C and you never really <Laughter> use them. C And then every so often you weed through them C and you think, where did I ever put that recipe. C But, F uh, that's mainly my, F uh, whole idea on D you know, short subject, F uh, reading and things like this. I, I subscribe, like I said, to a few C and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that. C But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, F uh, pertains to my daily life at the present time. Right. D Well, sometimes, if, D you know, if you're in transportation, in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that. C But I think, C and the idea is to, is and good, I can just dump them at the other end <laughter>, C and I don't have to carry them back with me. I do that when we travel. I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we, no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I, Right, al, although now, <Laughter> That's when you really have time. D Now D see your computer ones, I got into computer work somewhat, F uh, we have our own computer system at home C and I tried, F uh, reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it C and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along. It was, D you know, kind of a little bit more than what I needed, C so I never did get into them. I <breathing>, when I bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail. I think they all that, thought, D well, we have a live one <laughter>. She'll subscribe <laughter>. C But they were wrong. I never got into them. C But, C but, Okay? D All right, I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point. It was nice talking with you. Okay. Uhhuh. Bye, D now. I don't, F uh, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, F uh, I need to read that, F uh, I just don't take any at home. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Right. Right. I u, I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, F uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home. C But, yeah, the subscriptions ran out C and I never renewed them. C And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to read them. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. When, when I had my magazines at home, I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, D you know, C and if something caught my eye, then I might read something, C but otherwise than that, D you know, they were, <breathing> F uh, D you know, not too useful to me. D You know I got some good recipes from them sometimes, C but <laughter>, Uhhuh. That's right, that's right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. <Throat_clearing> D Well, since I work with computers during my work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything. C And I have to read the magazines, D you know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these, <breathing>, F uh, magazines such as that, C so I really, <breathing> D you know, just, <<pause>> I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home. Uhhuh. Right. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. If I, if I go on an airplane ride or something, I'll stop in and pick up a, D you know, a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane. C But, F uh, D you know, that's basically just about <breathing>, I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Okay. It was nice to talk with you, too. Thank you. Byebye.
