D Well, Stephanie, what's your position on gun control? Uhhuh. D Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles? Really? C And that didn't help at all? F Huh. Uhhuh. I usually just, I'm trying to think of, I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the, the, D like three, where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns any, by any means, C but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, F uh, D you know, you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and, D you know, right off the shelf. C And C but, Uhhuh, exactly. C And, so, I think that kind of control is, would be good, C but the, F uh, I, D you know, I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and, just to kind of exam it a little bit C and I, I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, F uh, only the guns were in the hands of the criminals, C but how many times, I guess I have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun. C And maybe they just don't report those C or I'm not sure C or, D you know, I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed C but good thing they had their gun on them C and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. True. Did, did you, were you brought up in a family that hunted C or, How about that. F Huh. Uhhuh. F Oh, jeez. Right. Uhhuh. Right. I've also always thought about the idea, D you know, most sports, D you know, which are the N R A and people have their thing, D you know, if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature. Most of that's done with rifles and such. F Uh, though there's, D you know, probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns. C But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous, you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that, you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately, D you know, you, if they had to have a rifle or was, D you know, made it more difficult to get a, a, F uh, a handgun. D Now of course, D you know, in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want. C But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and, D you know, temporarily a little bit, F uh, offset or off keel, I don't know if that's a large percentage of, F uh, crime or not C but I guess it would be some. C But I, I think definitely, D like today they just introduced the, what's called the Brady bill. The seven day mandatory waiting period, on getting any guns. C And I think that, Shoot that's a good idea. F Oh, sure. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, that's kind of, kind of wild. Uhhuh. That is kind of wild. D Well, that's all very interesting <throat_clearing>. D Well, thanks for talking. Goodbye. D Well, on a scale of one to ten, F uh, being ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, F uh, total ban, I probably would lean more towards six or seven. F Um, I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals. F Um, I lived in Massachusetts for two years C and they have a total ban on guns C and I saw that, it didn't stop crime in that state. Any, any kind of firearms. Yeah. F Uh, it's, there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught, F um, with a firearm C and also I think there was a fine. No, I don't, the, the crime is not any better or any worse, E I mean it's, I, I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse, C but it certainly didn't get any better. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I, I agree with that. I, I think that the, the law is on who can buy a gun are, are way too lax. I think that, I think that the, Yeah. F Um, I, Yeah, I, I'm, I'm not really sure, I don't, personally I don't own a gun, F um, C and I don't think I probably ever would, F um, although I would like to know how to handle one, C and I think it's good that everyb, C and I think everybody should learn how to handle one. F Um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one. F Um, No. F Uh, nobody in my family hunted, F uh, my father had, had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts <laughter>. We lived in New Hampshire at the time. C And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns, C so we ended up, F uh, with these guns, C and my, really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right C and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere. C And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns C and it, it kind of scared me. C But I think that if I learn how to use one, I would, I would feel better. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. I would definitely support that. Yeah. I, I, I agree the thing that scares me, F uh, though about where I would, I would wa, definitely want some sort of legislation C and coming from the north east, I'm just not used to seeing, F um, these, C and I, I know this may sound kind of stereo typical C but <<pause>> the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks. That's kind of scary to me that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism. D You know, C and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on, in L A, on the freeways, C and then you come here in, in the Dallas area, F um, I don't, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles. F Um, especially not in the back window, for everybody to see. D Sure you're welcome. Okay, byebye.
