D Well, F uh, let's see, what type of car do I want? D Well, I'd like to have a Corvette. <Laughter> C But my, F uh, weekly wages don't <laughter> apply for me to have that kind of car, C so F uh, I'm engaged to get married C so, I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons. Yeah, C and, F uh, C so, F uh, to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much. C And we have a truck, C so probably a economic size car or, F uh, Right now I have a eightyseven Cavalier. It's a piece of <laughter>, Uhhuh. Right. <Laughter>. C But while we're talking, right <laughter>. Right. F Oh, I know. Right, that insurance does come into play. I forgot about that. What kind of insurance do you have up there C or is it real high up there? Right. Right, E I mean that insurance is high dollars. C But, Right, yeah. <Laughter>. Right. Right, yeah. What's everybody drive up there? E I mean in Wisconsin, they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive C or, do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything? Right, it never snows down here, C so, Really? We haven't had snow yet. We usually only get D like once a year or so. Kind of strange to you all, F huh? <Laughter>. Because, how, it's like seventy degrees here right now. Yep, how, how cold is it there? Really? Huh. Really? Huh. C But, F um, D so what, what is your dream car? Uhhuh. What's your favorite color? Yeah. Blue? Right <laughter>, right. D So, what kind of car do you drive right now? Really? Really? Really? Oh. Yeah. Right, does everybody have their windows tinted up there? Everybody has tinted down here. D So, you been down here before? Really? Did you like it? Yeah, it's different I bet, F huh. Right <laughter>. It's D like, D you know, everybody freaks out when it sn, F Oh, wow. Yeah. Right. What kind of a car do you have now? <Laughter> My car is really old, too, C because, F uh, I drive out of town a lot of the weekends C and, F uh, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage. C And, F uh, same here, F uh, D you know, a nice car, American made C and, F uh, D you know, a, a nice car, C but not too expensive, C because, F uh, I couldn't afford D like a brand new D like Lamborghini <laughter>. I hardly drive, While we're talking, my next car, I'd like to be sporty and, D you know nice, C but, D you know, it's expensive C and then insurance is really high for that, too C so, Something with a, that's not too sporty because of insurance, then <laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, no mine just got lowered because I just turned twentyone C and, F uh, I'm not sure really how much I pay. I just, my mom's helping me out, D you know, because I'm a college, I'm in college C and, F uh, C so I just give her the money <laughter> and take her word for it <laughter>. Yeah, yeah, it is, C so, C And the more expensive the car, the higher it is C so, Unless I win the lottery, I won't be driving, anything too expensive. I don't plan on buying a car for many, many years <laughter> C so, I have to make this one last as long as I can. F Uh, in Kenosha? <Laughter>. F Oh, it just is, Yeah, we, we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because, F uh, because of the snow, you mean C or, <Laughter> D Well, we don't have any snow here now. It all melted. Yeah, there is no snow at all. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah, it is. F Oh, don't tell me that <laughter>. D Well, D actually, it's been warm, it's in the forties. Yeah, C and that's, that's really warm. F Uh, C and it's supposed to rain tomorrow C so we, I've only seen snow once this year. C And it was really bad C and then it all melted D like within the week. C And now there is no snow, C so, F Uh, I haven't really thought about it. I'm not too big on cars. E I mean, I don't know the names and stuff, C but if I were to go to a car lot and D like look at them <Laughter> I would pick out one that, D you know <laughter> looked really nice. F Uh, for a car? Probably blue. D Like if it, D you know, was just an average, middle class car. C But if I were to get a sports car, maybe white or red <laughter>. <Cough> Yeah. F Uh, it's a Sky Hawk Buick. Eightythree, I think. Yeah, F uh, like eightytwo thousand miles. Yeah. I'm afraid it's not going to last me <laughter> that long C and I hope it does, though. It's a two door. I like, I like smaller cars. They're, I find them more comfortable to drive. F Uh, no, I don't see too many cars tinted. F Oh, I'm sure, yeah. I could, I could see why. Yep. F Uh, It was busy <laughter>. Yeah, It was nice. I remember, F uh, swimming on Easter day C and it was D like really cold up here, C but came back with a little tan, C so that was nice <laughter>.
