Do you have any children? Twelve and sixteen. D Well, I have three, C and, F uh, they're five and three and nineteen months. C So we kind of got different ball game C but, F uh. <Throat_clearing> What, F uh, do you feel like you have any time, to spend with them? They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents. <Laughter>. Right. F Oh, uhhuh. Right. Sure. F Oh, D well, that's nice. You're stuck together. No. I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part. Right. C And so that kind of gives him, F uh, time with his dad, then. Gives him a little bit of that individual time. Right, C and they want to be able to spend, F uh. D Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year, C and every day that she's not at school, F uh, she thinks we need to have someone over and play <Laughter> C and that kind of yeah, it's hard, I think, F uh, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should <laughter>. I'm more worried about, F Oh, I didn't this done, I didn't get, the kitchen needs to be cleaned this needs to be done, C and C and I need to re, remind myself to slow down C and it'll still be there tomorrow. C But that's kind of hard to do, D you know. You don't see yourself getting. Uhhuh. Right. Slow down a little bit. F Oh, uhhuh. You can do, F uh, more than than when you travel. This is the first year we're staying home, too, C and, F uh, <throat_clearing> I think it's going to be real quiet C but, F uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games C and, Right. Of co, of course. F Oh, yeah. Wouldn't take it apart after that. That'd be kind of fun. <Laughter>. Right, right. No no. In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V s C and I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication C and the communication that would take place in a family, usually people are not sitting in front of that. Yes, C and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right? Whereas, F uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, D well, I shouldn't say I could not, C but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something. Because they talk so much, isn't that the, You're kind of like, what are you talking about C and, F uh, You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you. They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's, Yeah, I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen. Uhhuh, how about you? Oh. Right <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well. That's true <laughter>. You D actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older, C but it's, of course, still really important. I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old. F Um, I work two nights a week at a, I'm a librarian C and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library. They keep it open, D you know, for kids to do their work C and he, F um, C and then they, the school district hires an aide, D you know, to work for me. D Well, my son is my aide. <Laughter> C So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together C and there's usually not very much business. E I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet. C So. C So we, I have sort of a captive audience, C so I really do spend probably more time with him than, than most, D you know. C But, F uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too. C But his dad's at home pretty much that time. Yeah, that's true, yeah. C But, C but it is hard, once they get that age, E I mean, their friends are the most important thing there is. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah, it's kind of hard. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, that's true. Yes, it is hard to do, right, yeah. D Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, D you know, organized or neat C or, D you know then I think it, it is hard. It's, F um, I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, D you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time D yeah, with family. We have, we often go to Illinois for Christmas, C and we're not this year, C and it's just really nice because we can do, D you know, the things you want to do. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, right. D See, we usually do that, my, my kids even have already gotten out, F um, my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer C but, D you know, C but every now and then, E I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind, D you know, C and he wants to be an engineer, C so he still likes all that kind of building stuff C and, F um, we have the train, C and we haven't had that Lego train together for years, C and, F um, C so he sat down, C and I told him I really wanted him to build the train, C and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together, I wouldn't take it apart yeah, C and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree. C And, F um, C so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school <laughter> was out on Friday, C and, F um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, D you know. D you know, these are kind of things D like during the normal rat race those kinds of things never happen C but. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yes, yeah. Which is, Uhhuh, C and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, <laughter> D you know, they're totally turned off to everything else. The rest of. No <laughter>. That's right. Yeah, yeah, me too. <Laughter> Yeah, I don't watch very much of it at all, e, to, to the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that yeah, they talk about T V shows, C and I, F huh, D you know, how can you watch that, D you know <Laughter> it's the best show on, I don't know. <Laughter>.
