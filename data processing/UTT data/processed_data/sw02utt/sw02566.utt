Okay. Do you have any children? <Laughter>. You don't. Yes, I have, F uh, one. A five year old daughter. Yes, I do. She was, F um, <Lipsmack> at a private, D well, I stayed <Breathing> off work with her for little over of a year when she was born. C And then I had her at a private sitter for, I guess, two, two and a half years after that. F Um, she was referred to me by a couple of people C and she turned out to be wonderful. I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't think. I didn't want to s, send her straight to a day care. C And, even though she was that old, I still didn't want her to go to a day care. C And this lady, you would think it was her own. Yeah. She's real good. <Breathing> Yes. It is. C And, F um, now I have got her in a Montessori school. C And she's really, really doing good and learning a lot. <Throat_clearing> C And, D actually, I've started working up there in the afternoons, too. D So, <Laughter>. Y, D well, yeah. I guess. I'm going to quit as soon as school, the school season's over. C But, F uh, I really enjoyed being with her up there. I hate it for her, she has to stay that much longer, C but, Yeah. They, they go f, F uh, yearround, F uh teach them. Now, in the summer they have D like a lot of field trips. There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one, and stuff like that. It's a lot more lax. C But, C but they still go through all their, F uh, curriculum as usual. F Um, gosh <Laughter>. I ca, my husband and I both went. We kind of give her the third degree <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, we went over to her house, C so we told her, D you know, pro, D well, we didn't tell her, we just told here we'd be over that day. We didn't tell her when. C So, that way I didn't think, D y, you know, the house would be, D y, you know, cleaned or anything for me specifically. C And, F um, she had a daughter, C and I want to say her daughter was like six or seven, right around first, second grade. <Baby> C And, F um, at the time she kept anoth, one other child, F um, about a four year old, I believe. C But it was only like a parttime basis. <Noise> C So, we went over there C and <Breathing> we questioned her about what she fed them and, F um, what she did with them during the day and, F um, D you know, just how she treated them, how, how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and <Noise>, stuff like that <Noise>. C And, F uh, we really seem to be pleased with her. C And, F um, <Lipsmack>, Yes, F Oh, yes. C And she still loves her to death. E I, mean, when they see each other, D you know, they just love each other to death. C And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or, buying her things. C So, we're real, real lucky. C But aft, F uh, C so she stayed with her about, roughly two years, C and she, F um, she had to go back to work, they had some other expenses that came up C so she had to go, I guess, get a real job <Laughter>. Yeah. C So, F uh, D Well, I checked a lot of places out, D you know, the Kinder Cares and the, stuff like that. C And, F uh, I live in Garland. C And, there's this Montessori school that's nearby <Baby_talking> C and, F um, it had been recommended by some friends of ours C but, F uh, it, it's an older place. C And so, I, F uh, checked out all the new places that were near us C and then I checked that place out C and, F uh, even though it was older, it was, it was real comfortable and, I guess, kind of homey. C And they didn't just play all day long. D You know, D like, I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went <Talking> <<Child asked C And then they, almost all of them had a Montessori section. C And I thought, D well, D gosh, that must be pretty good, D you know, if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into, into, their school. C And they made sure they pointed it out, D you know. C But after I looked at this place, and I took Randi with me, F uh, <Lipsmack> I think just about to every place. One place I think I didn't take her. C And, I just kind of let her go, see, see what she felt like doing. C And that place, D boy, if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and, it's hard to drag her away <Laughter>. C So, I felt more comfortable at, that place. Yeah. C And she was real comfortable. C And she has really, really done good. I, I, it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her. C But, she seems to me to be, D you know, pretty quick and smart C and she's already reading and writing and stuff, like that. C And she just turned five last month. D So, Yeah. I think so. E I mean, I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time, C but, <Laughter>. Exactly. Exact, I wanted, to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months, because I know she's going to have to face that <Laughter>. C And, F oh, my God. Here we go, D you know. I just hate that, C but, <Lipsmack> <Breathing> D anyway. C So, you don't have any children. Do you have any l, nieces or nephews <Laughter> then? <Laughter> <Barking>. F Oh, really? <noise> <<Sounds like a child screams in the distance>>. Oh <child_talking>. <Noise> F Oh, really. Just easy <noise> to get them, there and stu, D Well, that's a shame. F Oh, really? That's, scary. Yeah. I w, I was petrified. <Laughter>. E I mean, that's, F uh, I don't know, that's just it. C And that's why <music> I don't mind paying more. F Um, I <music> don't know. I just feel m, Yes. C And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is, because I know what's really going on. C Because you don't know, F uh, C because D like at her school, <music> F um, as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive <music>. They sit C and they have car callers C and, C and some kid goes out and gets the kid C and, it's time to go <music>. D Well, at first that always kind of bothered me. E I mean, not bothered me, C but I thought, D well, D you know, I'd like to see what she's doing, D you, know <laughter>. C But now that I'm there, E I mean, it's, it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. D You know, when their parents come, C and it's hard to get them out, C and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that. C And it's late at night, C so, D you know, now it doesn't bother me at all C but, Yeah. Sixtysix. That one that's, set back in the woods? Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Right. Right. It w, C and that's something I like, too, C because a lot of those places are <lipsmack>, like, D you know the one over here on seventyeight, Skaggs. That little Kinder Care, whatever it is? D You know, it's right there on, which this is on a highway, too. C But it's set back, enough to, I'm scared, I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out, C or C or, if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could, D you know, go, in and get one. Yeah. C And, that was one of the places I had checked out. C And it was, it, it was brand new when I checked it out C and, of course, it was beautiful and, clean and smelled wonderful in there, C but, D you know, I, that, I didn't base everything on that. <Laughter>. That's right. That's exactly right. You get some kids in there C and it's, over quick. C But, F um, I've been real pleased, knock on wood. I'm scared to death her going to public school. I don't know, I, w, I do know why because D you know, d, drugs and, everything else C and, they talk about how soon they start that C and that scares me. E I mean, you're just with them, Yeah. They've, F um, they've <child_talking> had police officers come in and talk to them about it. C But, of course, they still have no concept of, <Laughter> what in the world drugs are, D you, know C but, Right. C But I just think of her, D you know, next year she's going to be five, six years old in kindergarten, in same school with, D you know, F uh, I guess ten year olds. Isn't that, six, sixth, sixth grade, D you know, C and that's a big gap. C And that's, F uh, that, I can honestly see the peer pressure there. C And that, just, terrifies me to death. And stuff, those kids getting snatched C and I'm, I'm probably a little too over protective <laughter> C but, D Well, nowadays you have to be. If, D So, I at first thought, D you know, when I didn't have kids, I was going, D God, how can you be so protective <<Whispers beginning with God>>? D You, know <laughter> C but, it's easy now <laughter>. Yeah. Definitely. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's exactly right C and I do. C But anyway. D Well, are you ever, are you, b, are you, are you married <laughter>? Are y'all planning on having kids? C Or, D Well, that's good. C Because they're really neat. It's just. No. I don't. <Laughter>. Do you? Uhhuh. Did you ever have her in child care? Uhhuh. C And how did you choose that sitter? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Really? It's hard to find people like that. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. D Well, that's neat. Yeah. Do they have classes for them during the summer, too? Huh. Yeah. What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there? F Uh, good <Laughter>, I'm glad to hear that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Did you, did you introduce your daughter to her before you made, your decision? <Breathing>. Really? Yeah. . Yeah. Get a real job, full time. C So, what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. That's, the true test. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. F Huh, that, is good then. No, especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years, in school <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, really <Laughter>. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I have a nephew. He's a little brat. <Laughter> He goes to a really crummy day school. <noise> <<Snapped fingers>> My sister's not real bright, <noise> C so, C but he, he's <noise> <<Snapped fingers>> <child_talking> always sick. E I mean, <child_talking> he has always got some kind of, cold or something. C And, <noise> I don't know, <child_talking> I don't think this place is a very good place for him. It's just kind of convenient C and <noise> she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I don't think she checks things out very well <children> <barking>. Which, really surprises me. It is scary. Yeah. I know. I would be, too <laughter>. Yeah. Too many horror stories out there that, D you know. F Oh, yeah. That's right. I think that's an ideal situation. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's right. Is that where the, over there off of, like, I'm not sure what the street is, is it off of, near Country Club, C and all, yeah. Yeah. I, I, I've seen the signs C but I've never actually seen the place itself, D you, know. It's pretty, set far back, off the road. Yeah. Definitely. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah. There's a difference. Uhhuh. Ye, Yep. That's right. C Or, D you know, C or a car accident. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. No, because that all wears off. <Laughter>. <Breathing> Yep. <Laughter>. Really? I would be, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. It is scary. Do they teach them in school <child_talking> right now where she's at about drugs? Good. Right. Right. C And what to do when they're faced with it. Yeah. It is. Uhhuh. F Oh, I can, see it, too. Uhhuh. Nothing wrong with that <laughter>. Yes. You do. I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Now you understand <laughter>. That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say, when you have kids of your own, you'll understand <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yes. Yeah. We'd like to. Yeah.
