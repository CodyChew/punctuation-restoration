Okay, C so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess? <Laughter> Obviously you have kids. I haven't seen that one yet. F Um, the last movie I saw was, F uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. F Uh, D see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan. C But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be. It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be. Yeah, it was a pretty good movie. I, I'm ready to go. It just, it's, D you know, hasn't worked out that way yet. D You know, it's, F uh, it looks good, D you know if you like thrillers, D anyway. <Laughter>. In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards. C So <laughter>, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, what other movies have you seen then lately? Other than the, I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES. Is that any good, E I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one. C So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon. F Oh, D well, then it won't be too bad. D You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily, C but it was better than it could have been. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's important if you're going, D you know, if you're going, F uh, kids are going to, F uh, parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi, D you know, semi for them too. Yeah. Uhhuh. I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure. Do you take her, E or do you go to a lot of comedy movies C or to, What was the last comedy you saw? The last, F uh, in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw I said that wrong, the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox. D Well, that really wasn't too bad. There were, D you know, he's supposed, D you know, he's this actor, right C and he's playing a cop. C Or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff. I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop. E I mean, there, there were times when he was, D like, he'd be running with a gun or whatever. He didn't look like a cop when he did it. C And I was so impressed with that because, D you know, usually, F Oh yeah, because, E I mean, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to, D you know, to imitate them or whatever. C And, F uh, I thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far. D Now, by the end he was looking more like a cop. C But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, D you know, he was trying to, trying to get it, C but he wasn't there yet. C And you could tell it, C and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, D you know, because I think, or directing job. I think they did a real good job of that. C And James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop. E I mean, D you know, he just, Yeah, C and there were, there were some definite, F um, should I say, tense moments, with him in there. Yes, I, I, I had seen it before Christmas, C but I took a date to it, F uh, about a month ago. C So, I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago. C So. I really enjoyed it. Of course, the bad thing about it was, F uh, the second time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it as much, C and I was kind of surprised at that. I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over. C But before, maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time. I had laughed so hard I was hoarse. I really was, I was hoarse getting out of there. C And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it, E I mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time because I had just gone overboard the first time. I don't know C but, Yeah, E I mean, it was, it was a great movie though. I loved the movie. <Laughter> I love those movies. F Oh, yeah. D Well, you have to see them more than that. I, I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch. E I mean, it's amazing I love those movies I really do. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, isn't it though. D You know, C but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper. That's exactly what, I was going to say. I keep not doing it until after I'm there C and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things. Easily. Yeah, yeah, C And then if you want popcorn and stuff it's just, E I mean, F uh, it's incredible. No, No, nowhere near that expensive. C And, it, it's just the idea that these, F uh, these actors, D you know, live in such lavish style. E I mean, it's as simple as that. Yeah, C and as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to keep paying them. Yes. F Oh yeah. F Oh, that was, that was an excellent movie. No, don't. Don't. That needs the big screen. It really and truly does, because to get the feeling of D like when the buffalos are, when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it. You really truly do. I would, E I mean, I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video, too. C But I'm glad I didn't. I really and truly am. E I mean, that mov, that was one movie I came out impressed. I really and truly did. E I mean, I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars. None at all. Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one, one movie taking all the honors. I wanted him to win best actor on top of it, he was, Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one. C But even though they were okay, the girl in it, they, somebody made an interesting observation, now that I think back on it, I'd say yeah, I can't believe that either. She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times. You know what I mean, D you know. It was just too perfect at all times. That was a mistake that they made. They shouldn't have done it. D Now the best, the supporting actor, he was good, C but from what I heard, the guy who got it was better, C so I, D you know, I can see that. C But, F oh, F Oh, D well there are, there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side. C But, F um, it's it's Okay, no problems <laughter>. It, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides. C So there's, Yeah, C but, D well, C And, C and, of course, C and, D well, yeah, that, and plus, E I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt. C So, E I mean, they are killing buffalos in it. C But they don't stress that very much, they really don't. C And I think it's an excellent movie for, if, if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good. It's, it's, it's a long movie. F Oh yeah. I may have to see the video. I hadn't even thought of that. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, yeah, I kind of like it when they do that, because the video, like I said, there are certain things you can't do with a video C and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea. Because E I mean when you rent a video, videos, of course, are not cheap either C and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea. Because they, they make bundles of money off those things. F Oh, I do too. Yeah, but not enough. Yeah I'm getting to the point where, D you know, I watch, D well I watch NICK AT NIGHT. F Um, a lot, D well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie <laughter>. <Laughter> That's right. Yeah, C but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. That's an excellent movie. F Oh, was that good. I heard, F Oh, okay. D Well, that's good. Yeah. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat. Right. Yeah, it is. Right. C And I do. <Laughter> Really. F Oh, I love them like that. I'm not, E I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies, <ringing> C but I like that where they run tense. I really enjoy, they keep me guessing the whole time. It's really, it was really interesting. Oh. Yes, the new one, of course <laughter>. Oh <<sound drawn out>>. Amarillo. I didn't see the first one. My husband said it was, F um, about the same lines. C So, yeah. Right, right. C And I was impressed with the fact that, F um, it wasn't that childish. You know what I mean. It wasn't, my daughter's five, E I mean she understood everything. She goes to almost all movies with us except, D you know, R rated. C And she really enjoyed it, C but it was on a higher level, D you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did, C and I liked that. Right. <Laughter>. That's right, that's right. It's pretty good. C But we take her to just about every movie, C and, she, F uh, she does really good. We've taken her from real young, C and she does real good. Like I said, we don't take her to R s. C So, if and when we ever get a babysitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it. F Oh, no, no. Yeah, yeah. <Whispering> <<sort of to herself>> F Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw? <<back to regular speech>> F Huh, F huh, F huh. Good question, <laughter> good question. We don't get to go that often, C but something on the tip of my tongue, C and I can't think of which one it was. F Uh. Gosh, I can't remember. Uhhuh. C But that, that sounds good. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, okay. That's neat. The part was hard, to do that. Right. Yeah, Right. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I like him. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE. It was really cute. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Right. <Laughter> Maybe so, maybe so. Yeah, I did, too. I'm looking forward to this summer, F uh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out. I do too. E I mean, they are just slapstick <<word drawn out for emphasis>>. It, you have to see those twice to catch everything. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I do too. I do too. C So I'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious, as they all do. D Well, we <throat_clearing>, we try to go a couple times a month, I guess to see a movie. It, it's just getting so expensive. C But normally we don't think about it until, <Laughter>. I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us. Yeah. I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both. D You know popcorn is not that expensive. C So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke. Yeah. We just keep breeding them. I guess so. D Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES? I haven't seen, we're waiting for the video. No, really? Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh really? Oh. Uhhuh. Right. Everythin, yeah, yeah. Yeah, F oh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You think my daughter would like it? F Oh, okay. She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes. <Laughter>. D See, that's the one, that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie is because I love buffalos for some weird reason, <laughter> C and I know they're fake. Okay, okay. F Oh, that'll be good. We really need some, my husband keeps wanting to. Yeah, C and I heard the video's even going to be longer. They did a lot of stuff that they cut out. Yeah, that's true, they said, Yeah, they said there's a lot that had been edited, because of the length and that they wanted in, C so they're going to put it in the video. C And that way you can watch it at your leisure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. True. <<Whispering>> I know it <<regular voice>>. Isn't that ridiculous. We have cable which helps a lot <laughter>. Yeah, we keep holding out, D you know.
