<Noise> D Actually, I've been involved in electronics a long time. F Uh, in computers C and I have really resisted the impulse to <swallowing> get one for the home. F Uh, up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago, I got one for my son. A, a Macintosh F uh, L C. It's a real easy to use color, F uh, computer C and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it C and he uses it for his school work. Huh. <Lipsmack> Where you going to school? I see. In engineering? C So that explains wha, all the, F uh, computer assignments. D Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work? <Lipsmack> No. No, I just have one for my son C and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing. At wo, at work, F uh, <laughter> I'm a technologist, F uh, C and I, in the past, have done a great deal of, of, F uh, system development just through, F uh, software development programming. F Uh, C but now I find myself using the computer, even the computer at work is primarily a, F uh, word processing system and a communication system. Yes. Emil is, probably pulls down a third a, of all my time. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. D Well I'm a oldtimer. I did my Master's thesis on, F uh, a typewriter. F Uh, I rented an I B M Selectric. C And it was a pretty big deal. Yeah. It, F uh, D well, D you know, it's just, it was just a completely different world then. I like it, yeah. I like it from a distance really. I, I see the packages on it, F uh, that are available C and it's nice. I really don't use it myself. F Uh, I, when I come home from work, I, I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things <laughter>. F Uh, C so I let my son do it C and, F Uh, of course, D you know, there's, F uh, there's an intellectual evolution taking place where, it's sort of a joke C but it's really true, the oldtimers, even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R s and whatnot C and the kids, they just take to it like candy. <Tone> <static> F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I've, I'm currently in school C so I, I've had an I B M clone, I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually upgrading I guess. C And, F uh, I've found, I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it C and I can't really, I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer, F uh, simulation or analysis, C so it, it's pr, very essential for me. Schools have them, F uh, C but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school. It's very easy, it's much more convenient to have one at home. At Georgia Tech. Yeah, C so. Yes, actually. Yeah, it, F uh, F Um, sure. I have some games, <noise> of course, which I play on there C and, F uh, F uh, <noise> I have a program which allows me to access a, F uh, weather data bank C so I can, D like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby. C So, it provides other means other than just strict, F uh, D you know, computations and so on, C so. Have you, do you have a computer for yourself at home? F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Tha, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Do you use Email and like that? Yeah. It's, I, I, F uh, I have modem night computer C so I can log into the sys, the, F uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which is, which can be useful. C But, F uh, yeah that's, that and word processing is while I tend to, E I mean, obviously, I do most of my, almost all of my report <noise> writing on, on my computer, F uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. C So it's, it's really become, I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember, D actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in, in my life to do a, a to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out. C And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high, C so <noise>. F Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah. It must have been tough. It's a little bit strange for me. I, I did my Master's thesis, F uh, last year C and I did that on a computer C and it seems like, I just can't imagine how people did it before. It must have been just so much, so much work <noise>. Yeah. C So, F uh, C so yo, you used your son's Macintosh then? Do you, do you find it, do you like that kind of computer? Uhhuh. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, i, if, if, if the interface is there so that it's D like fun to use C and the challenge <tone> <static>,
