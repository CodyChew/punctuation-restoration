Okay, C so, F um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years? Uhhuh. Really. Uhhuh. D Well, <Laughter> Yeah. Really. Where'd you live up, where'd you live at, F Oh, did you? I'm from, Illinois, C so. How long, how long you been in Dallas? F Oh, really? Yeah, F uh D you know, F uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do. F Oh, yeah, I agree. Yeah, I, I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse, C and D you know, I, I think there's, to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values. D So, C But, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think there's more pressure D like on both parents to work, and things like that than there used to be C and, D So. Okay. C But, F uh, I don't know, that's just, that's one thing I see, I see a lot more, D you know, double income families and a lot more D like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess. Yeah, that's for sure. Yeah, without it hardly, that's right. Yeah. Yeah just because they can't get into one, yeah, that's right. Yeah, the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways, C so. Yeah, that's, that's a good point C so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. F Oh, yeah, I agree. D Well, I hope so, D you know, at some point C but I don't know at what point, Yeah, Yeah. It's, F uh, Yeah, that's right. Do you work at T I? Do you? What, F uh, department do you work in? Are you? I'm in semiconductor division too. D So. How long you been with them, since you moved down here? F Um, I'm over at the Center One building. Are you really. What floor? I'm on the seventh floor. How about that. D Well, it's a small world. C So, C so let's see, second floor, you work with, F uh, linear. Do you. Do you, F uh, do you know Alec Morton? F Oh, you do, F huh. D Well, he comes up and pushes us around C so, F uh, C so I'm pretty familiar with, F Huh? Yeah <laughter>. Yep, you must know him. His reputation precedes him. Yeah, D Well, F uh, he, F uh, boy, he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. They, they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D ers grief, C so I can believe it C but, Yeah, let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about how long, I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess. F Um, been with T I like twelve, C but I started out in Lubbock. Lubbock is, I don't know, I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. Yeah. Yeah, C but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too, E I mean, here in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush. F Oh yeah. D Well, I got some friends that, F uh, seems like he went to school at D like DeVry. Is there a DeVry in Akron? Oh, F Oh, I see, D well, he went to school somewhere in Ohio, C and he's from that area, C and, F uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think C but, F uh, I haven't talked to him in a while, C but, F um, yeah, he, he misses it. He used to go back twice or three times a year, D you know, because he missed it. Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. You still have relatives back there C or, Oh. Really. D Well, let's see, how, how long are we supposed to talk here? <Laughter>. Yeah, D well my kids are probably needing me to go C so all right, D well, it's nice talking to you. Talk to you later. Bye. F Uh, I'm at a little bit of a loss, D you know, I don't know, ten years ago, D see I'm what, I'm about, F uh, twentyeight now C so when I was eighteen, things haven't changed a whole lot. People are being a little more, F oh, I don't know, a little le, a little less bigoted in some ways, I don't know seems to me. I guess I'm like my parents. The younger generation gets away with hell, C but, F uh, D Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted C but that may just be because I've changed. D You know, I used to live up north. Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant C but, F uh, I lived in Akron, Ohio. Oh. F Oh, about eight years. In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think, Yeah, I think it's, crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years, C and maybe that has a lot to do with it. Yeah, that's true. That's true, I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved C but that's more a matter of, D you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school. Hello. Somebody's at the door. Hang on just a second. <Noise> <<talking off phone>>. Okay. Yeah, that's true, it's getting more and more expensive to live. You can't, you can't make it, I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a, get a home and buy house, C and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever D you know, you just don't buy a house, Yeah. Yeah, for me it's kind of hard, I don't know. I think, I don't know, I think the middle class is shrinking and the, F uh, lower class is expanding C and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around. C But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, F uh C so, usually is I think. It's hard for me to say. I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those that gets caught. C But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs to be, be changed. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in semiconductor. Yeah. About eight years, yeah. Yeah, so am I. Two. D Well, Yeah. Yeah, I've probably seen him around. Are you D A D or something up there? Are you D A D or something? Yeah, D well, seventh floor. T A D, D Well. . Yeah, flat, dry and dirty, Yeah, I lived in the country for several years, C and living in the city is a whole different F uh, social structure C but, F uh, I don't even know I haven't been up there in years. No, I haven't been back in fi, ten, fifteen years. Yeah, I do, I just haven't had a chance to get back <laughter>. Catch them next year probably. I don't know, I think we ran out of social, social changes to talk about, C so. Okay, Yeah, All righty, bye.
