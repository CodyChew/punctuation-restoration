<Clicking> D Well I haven't had an awful lot of, F uh, incidents regarding child care. When my two year old was in New Orleans, she got bit on the cheek C and, F uh, C but, F uh, that's about the, the, F uh, the extent of it. C But, C but, C but when, I really am, a, am concerned about is that, F uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, F uh, F uh, D you know, investigation for, for, F uh, D you know, child molestation. C And I, C and I, C and I'm saying to myself, D well, D you know, y, you dump your, your, your little turnip off to, F uh, D you know, this child care place C and they don't pay very much C and w, why, why would they be interested in, in your little turnip unless, D you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is D well that's somebody to molest, D you know. C And, F uh, that's a terrible kind of thing C and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that C but my wife didn't work C and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it. Huh. Huh. F Oh, D well that's interesting. F Oh, my God. D Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that. F Oh, D well, yeah <snorting>. Uhhuh. D Well, not, not all of us. D You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. I'm an engineer. C And, Uhhuh. Yeah. Five hundred dollars a week. For two kids. That's incredible. F Oh, <laughter> F oh. D Well. W, Yeah. D You know, they could, somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare C and D you know, that's a good starting wage C but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care. Huh. E I mean we used <<mispronounced>> to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to babysit. C But mi, mine are twentytwo, twentythree and twentyseven C so D you know, that, I guess babysitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour? F Oh my. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <Hum> <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well I am a working mother <laughter>. I have three children C and my children, since I, F uh, since they were very young, I've had various, F um, different alternatives, child care arrangements C and like most working mothers <laughter> I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel, F uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home C and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune <laughter> over the years for a variety of opportunities. C So I, I, I, e, D you know, it is a problem. C And, C but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities C and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford. When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid babysitter that was wonderful. C And then as they got older, they went to, F uh, I preferred to call them schools C and they were really all day preschools C and they were wonderful. C And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things. C But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune. E I mean we were paying <swallowing> at one point, D well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children. D So. <Laughter> D Well, I mus, I'm a physician. F Uh and, as is my husband. C And, C and I felt, F uh, very good about working. I'm a pediatrician D actually. C So, F uh, C but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children C but, C and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think, <Laughter>. F Oh. D Well I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. C And we had a really wonderful arrangement, F uh, I'm with the university D actually C and they had a wonderful, F uh, program that started at age three C and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. C And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. C And they had wonderful, they had things like gardens and lots of pets C and just, they had a four to one F uh, teacher student ratio. C So that, that sort of an, most of the teachers had degrees. F Uh, <Laughter> Yeah. It was incredible D actually <laughter>. C But it was good. E I mean it was, it, at that time there were two children C and they were in special programs C and each one was a little over two hundred a week C and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra. C But the kids were, E I mean they really had some great opportunities. C But, tha, what you were alluding to earlier is, D you know, women who work for minimal wage an, and, and really have t, feel they have to put their children, sometimes they do put them in, F uh, fairly low paying sit, situations. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, even that, that really, I think, I don't, it's been awhile since I've looked at, my youngest child is eight. C So it's been a little while since I've looked into, D actually daycare centers. C But they are D you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Something like that. D Well, D you know, C but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children. E I mean it has been a real, F uh, th, there have been some good entrepreneurial <laughter> type experiences. C And I think, I think they have captured a certain market. Again the, C but then there are babysitting groups. As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections. As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around <hum>.
