Okay. How do you keep up with current events? Yeah, what what channel do you watch or what station? That's the one I watch. I usually keep up with T V. I don't, I am a student C so I really don't have much time to D like read the newspapers and stuff C so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes <laughter>. Yeah. The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes. The stations I listen to are just mainly music. Yeah. Do you think that T V is, F uh, pretty accurate. E I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized C or, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, it's they mainly go with D like popular topics just not D like basic news. Huh. Yeah. Going, they're, looks like they're going more for ratings <noise> than for D you know actual news. I think, D you know the <popping> probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers they typically have a better. I am from a small town too here in Texas and so that then D like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato C and, Yeah, farm report and oil reports. That's pretty <tapping> pretty sad or who killed who. Yeah. D Well, in, F uh, in Dallas, I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's C and the story was, F uh, Yeah. C And the news covered it D right, D you know, hours after it happened C and they were taping people who were crying who <noise> had everything C and then like three days later this, F uh, local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves. I just thought that was really that's kind of cold, Yeah C and it was just, they were showing D like these dead people C and they were showing people crying E I mean just taking advantage of D you know. . Yeah, it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story, C but just the play on people's emotions <noise>. It's just gotten so, E I mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if D you know C and everything. Yeah. Yeah. What did you think of the coverage of the war? Did you? Yeah. They kept just showing, D you know, how great we were doing C and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's a lot of times D like the news coverage showed all the, D you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties C and they kind of D you know, if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who D you know got really hurt and everything. F Um, D well D actually, usually, F uh, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work, F uh, usually catch the news in the morning. F Uh, N B C. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I usually tend to just, D you know, rely on, D you know, T V, F uh, again, D you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know D like, D you know D like what today's stories are C and I usually D like go out an buy a newspaper if D you know I'm interested in any particular one. Yeah, I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all. D Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to D like national news is just, F uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed C and D you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now D you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have D like the wonderful investigative reports, D you know, is you're kids bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, D you know? Uhhuh. Yeah. Also, also I have the observation of, F uh, with the press is that, D like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press, D you know, which only happened D like ten times in my life D you know first thing D you know for anything of D you know or anything that actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story it's something wrong. Uhhuh. <Tapping> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, the farm report. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <tapping> Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television. Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down C and, Was that D like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh yeah, I have seen that happen lots of times. D You know, F uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage <noise> D you know we were on the scene with our team players C and, Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. They are trying to get the, D you know, most emotional response for, Yeah <tapping>. Yeah, yeah. D You know, I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally D you know F uh, <noise> D you know even the national news I just find it to be D you know very watered down, very, F Uh, I fou, I found it very one sided. F Uh, D you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate. F Uh, D you know, not saying that we shou, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there, C but it just seemed like, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and I really think that D you know in the involvement that the press states, D you know that the the military basically sets the press,
