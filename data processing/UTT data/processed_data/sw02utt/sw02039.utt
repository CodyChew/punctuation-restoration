F Oh, yes. Yes, very much. As a matter of fact, I prefer public television. C And, F uh, I have, particularly enjoy the English comedies, and the English mysteries. Yes. Vociferously. Yes. D Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the only access we have to that of course is public television. I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect C but, F uh, the watching, what I do watch is, F uh, usually news and whatever is on public television. Any kind of, I also F uh, am very fond of great performances, in that regard. C But, F uh No <sigh>, no, no as a matter of fact, F uh, Turner Broadcasting, has been F uh, broadcasting all of the James Bond movies, every night this week, C so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, <Laughter> this week <laughter>. D Well, they're showing F uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment, C and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven. D So, No, no that's true. I was just thinking that today, he did, D well, in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate, in his early movies. Whereas, F uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, F uh, A how would you, F uh, ruddy look, C but F uh, F Oh yes. D Well, D you know he was, A when was it, last year or year before last, he was voted the sexiest actor in movies, or something. <Laughter> E I mean the man is sixtytwo years old. C But, F uh, C but otherwise D you know we, F uh, with P B S and so forth. C And I, I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but F uh, the series, F uh, YES MINISTER? That was about a, the Interior Minister, it was a comedy, the Interior Minister of, in England, with the permanent secretary, and bureaucracy and all that. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I know. D Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher. I, I read as I said, and, F uh, quite a bit. I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff. What, what do you do? What kind of work do you do? At T I? F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. D Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I C and I just wondered. I think that's something we all ca, No, no, I work for G T E. In Maryland, yes. I guess not. How did I hear about it? D Well I work, D you know, they are gathering a data base for voice processing. C And, that's my field of work also. C So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this C and I heard about it, C so I called them and asked if I could participate. C And, F uh, D You know send in the forms et cetera and F uh so forth. We could go back to television shows. <laughter> Yes, I have. D Well, no. That's, F uh, you could interpret it that way. F Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth, C but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably <sigh> F uh, after the what, F uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, <cough> wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek. D Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love. Okay, C so you can have, there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, D you know, F uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing. C So, in, as to those types of interpretations, F uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at. C So that's, D you know, you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true, C but there's too much historical fact involved just from the F uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true. C So, D you know, it depends on how you look at it. You can look at it, D you know, if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way. Yeah, D well, D Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible. D So, C But, F uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy. C But, F uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, C so, F uh. I think so too. Let's just, it's been very pleasant talking to you, C and have a good evening. Good night! Okay, F uh, my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE C and it has been for a long time C but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it. Do you by any chance? You do! D Well, wouldn't you know <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, Yeah, I watch mysteries too. Is that what you're referring to? Okay, yeah. That is good. I like, F uh, do you read? Okay, D well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books. C And, the plots are more, F um, challenging, D you know, than the sitcoms of regular T V. Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah. Me too. Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF? F Oh, that was a scream. Uhhuh, Really. <Laughter>. I used to like him too, he was my hero. In fact, I like Sean Connery to this day. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, he can never cut it <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, he does. Uhhuh, yeah. I liked his accent too. C And, he can even be in movies that are not, F uh, F uh, sexually oriented, C and he still comes off great. He is. Yeah, he had my vote double <laughter>. I don't care <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, what's that about? F Oh, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Right, I, I've seen it several times. It's a scream, C but I have to go to bed, I have to get up and, and work the next morning. I wish they'd put those, that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF. It came on after DOCTOR WHO, on Saturday nights, here at least. C And it should, of course I li really it was, I don't think they should show it during prime time, C but still, it was funny. Uhhuh. Yeah. I'm a Payroll Clerk. Just an accounting clerk. No, F uh, I have a friend who works for T I C and I work for a tire service, here in, I'm from Dallas. Yeah, yeah, it could be T I ers, I think, probably are participating more than anybody else, C but I needed the money. <laughter> This is five bucks here. Yeah, really. Do you work for T I? Really? How did you hear, F oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh! Oh. Right. <laughter> D Well, D you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible? I've heard that it's really against the, D well E I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I guess if you're looking for that, you're, that, F uh, Uhhuh. Really. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Surely we've made it. It was very nice talking to you. You too. Byebye.
