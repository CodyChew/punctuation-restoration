All right. D Well, <noise> F uh, quite a few C and they're varied. They don't, F uh, F uh, encompass, F uh, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing. C But, I do, F uh, quite a bit of wreath making C and my dogs are my hobbies. I do a lot of gardening. I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time. D Now, what do you mostly do <noise>? F Oh, boy <noise> <laughter>. That should be fun. Yeah. How old are they? D Well, I think that's better than having that party at home <noise>. Yeah. C And, the the, the skating rink does the rest practically, I guess. Boy, what a help that is. What kind of, D Well, not that long. F Uh, just since October. We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma. C So, F uh, <noise> we are, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the country. C But, we did spend twenty years in Norman <noise> and Enid and loved it. C But, we needed to get back, F uh to our older parents. C But, I am loving it <noise>. The weather is divine. Yes. F Oh, yes. Very much. Yeah. D Well, my husband was with, F uh, <<tape begins to be much clearer, a lot less back ground noise and fuzz>> University of Oklahoma and, Phillips University in Enid. C And then he went with, F uh, <noise> <<a squealing>> a family corporation that had, F uh, has oil and ranching and varied enterprises. C And, F uh, he just quit a perfectly good job and came, we <talking> came East <laughter>. Yes. Yes. Uhhuh. He's doing, F uh, quite a bit of consulting work and, has been offered a permanent position C and he's contemplating <talking>. He, he's liking this free time D actually <noise>. It's just wonderful after all, these years of working. F Um, <talking> <noise> <lipsmack> a gal who works, F uh, with T I on this project <noise>. <Bird_squawk> I think she's a temporary worker <bird_squawk>.

Uhhuh. Yes. D Well, it's getting, a little hot, isn't it? It, Yeah. It sure does. C Or maybe this evening anyway. Very, much so. Yeah. No. No it doesn't. Enid is, F uh, it's in the northwest. It's, F uh, directly across the straight, F uh, state from Tulsa. F Uh, Sure you have. Yes. D Well, Enid is, not, F uh, an unknown little city. It, F uh an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there. C And it, was, F uh, a very, F uh, selfsufficient, F uh, wealthy <noise>, F uh, town, for a long time, anyway <laughter>. D You know <noise>, until, F uh, everything happened, the bottom fell out. C But, it's beginning to do well. C But, there's a lot of, F uh, <talking> old time wealth there that, has helped to stabilize things. Si, Yes. Something like that. Oh. D Well it's, it's <talking> <<female and children in the background>>, pretty. The weather is wonderful. F Uh, this winter <noise> we, it was just, we had so many wonderful days.

D Well, Carolina, this part, is very much like that, too. Very, foggy and, misty. The moss grows, on the trees <talking> in the woods up, eight, ten, feet. Yeah.
