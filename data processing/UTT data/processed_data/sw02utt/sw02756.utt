C And, F uh, what part of Virginia, F uh? Blacksburg. Okay, I've been, Sounds vaguely familiar. Yeah, okay. I, I hadn't been down in that part of the state really. F Uh, I wish we did <laughter>. F Oh, okay. Where all you guys go? Uhhuh. Uhuh. F Uh. All these places that I've never been <laughter>. F Uh D well, it really depends, E I mean, F uh, <<pause>> seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately, F uh, my, F uh, fiancee's family's from Wisconsin C and so we've been out there a couple of times C and, F uh, I, F uh, went to Purdue for a couple of years, C so I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends C and, F uh, F uh, I'm a real big baseball fan C so I usually try to combine it with, F uh, catching a couple of games somewhere. I'm, F uh, I'm a big Red Sox fan, C but, F uh, I, F uh, F uh, you're a Red Sox fan too? I usually try to catch whoever's in town though, I don't specifically, I, D you know, go to Cleveland to see them play, the Indians or the Red Sox, F uh, F uh, that's about it, we don't, E I mean, we do a lot of little trips around here, F uh, C and, F uh, Not that much. We've gone out to, F um, F uh, a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water. F Uh, have you ever heard of it? Yeah, it's, it's really neat. It's this house built on, on a waterfall C and it's, F uh, really cool <laughter>. F Um, of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there, F uh, the first time we went out there was, F uh, the day after hurricane Hugo had come through <laughter>. C So, E I mean they, they didn't have any power C and it was really cold and, and rainy C and, F uh, we went up about a year later C and it was better but not a whole, lot better <laughter>. C So, F uh, where else did we go, F uh, <<pause>> we've gone to Richland, last year and, F uh, had a good time, down there. F Uh, my girlfriend has with her sisters C but I haven't been, down there. F Uh, I hear that's nice. We're going to get down, probably down Norfork sometime this Summer, just to see why, catch a football game actually <laughter>. F Uh, spend a day and a lot of money <laughter>. Yeah, I've heard, F uh, I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the, of the price attached, to it. We just, we, I, F Uh. F Uh, yeah, we'll, do that. F Oh, okay, C so I can wander around without, F Oh, okay, I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings? F Oh, okay, I didn't know that. Yeah, I think, F uh, they do the whole with, D you know, paying, they really did throw away a lot of money to get, getting one thing or another, C but they had a good time C so. F Uh, F uh, Yeah, I was, F uh, we use it live in California C and, F uh, my, F um, up, up around San Francisco, C and, F uh, there was one year when my father was, F uh, my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles, C so, my father was working down in Los Angeles for like, F uh, six months or so, F uh, D actually I think it was closer, I think to a full year C and, D you know, we'd, he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays, D well, any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles, C so I saw, I went to Disneyland about five times, in one year C and I really have no great urge to go back now. F Oh, it was great, because, F uh, D well, the times that were really fun were when, F uh, we had vacation C but the kids in Los Angeles didn't C so we basically had one of the parks. F Uh, Disneyland, E I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland, C but there was another, F um, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens, F uh, there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times, we just get, get done with them and they go, F oh, do you want to go again, sure. No, I'd like to, sometime C but, Yeah, I've never been, the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte. C So, I, F um, keep wanting to get further, D you know, I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers, ago C but never did it. My, F uh, my sister lives in Charlotte C and they've gone to, Charleston a couple of times and had a real good, time. F Uh, yeah, one of these days we'll get down there, although <laughter>. I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it <laughter> <<pause>>. We're, F uh, we're getting married in about, a year C and, our honeymoon, we're going up to this, F um, F uh, place in Wisconsin called Door County, it's up by Green Bay. It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted, to go, C and, F uh, It's, F um, F uh, I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin C but there's kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, F uh, <laughter> in the Lake Michigan, that's Door County <laughter>. D So, Yeah, they call it the Cape Cod of the, F uh, the Midwest C so, F uh, we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun, she, F uh, she had this, F uh, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide C so, F uh, that should be a lot of fun. Oh. F Oh, boy. F Oh, that'll be fun <laughter>. D Well, yeah, you won't even, notice it though <laughter>. Is that, is that how you got into this, F uh, this, D you know, F uh, data base? F Oh, okay. Yeah, I was, I was just, E I mean most of the people I've talk to are from, are from Texas, C so, when I, D you know, when I heard you were from Virginia I was like, F oh, okay, there's somebody different, C and you said, F oh, I got somebody down in Texas, I go, okay, that the connection, right there <laughter>. F Uh, I, F uh, most people talk to Texas, there's been a couple of other the people, F uh, most of whom are like me that work in, in speech labs that are going to use data base, eventually. C So, F uh, it was fun I, D actually yesterday, I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in. <Laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, that's neat.
