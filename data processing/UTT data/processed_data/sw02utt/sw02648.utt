C So, D well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day, C so. F Um, D well, what do you think is, F uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air? Yeah, D well, that's me too. After, F um, on channel thirteen, F uh, they had some, some programs the day before, C and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday, C but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, D you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people C and, C and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot, C and that actually, F um, as our population increases and, D you know, our, of course, our, our cars, D you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution C and, D you know, they're reg, they're regulation that's placed on them is, E I mean, it's better than it used to be C but it's incredible that they still don't have, D you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air. D You know, I, I just, I can't stand that C and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that, D you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a, we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a plant, F uh, a Pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours, C and I know people that work there that, of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals, C but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, F um, what they do, F uh, to, F uh, make their dough and st, to, clean out the flour and stuff like that, yeah, E I mean, it's incredible. C And, F um, they said that they're, D you know, they have a little creek that runs by them C and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, D you know, shut down everything C and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping, C and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine, that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant I can't imagine plants, Yeah, they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, D you know to, to break the flours down C and then they, they also do testing there, C and I don't, D you know, wh, when you consider, D you know, it's probably not radioactive C but toxic can be, can be anything that's cr, F uh, classified that can damage the Earth. C So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, D you know, that chemical wise that they use to, F uh, that they are testing with, that they're dumping. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think they do the packaging at this plant, C but they do, they do a lot of research C and they do, F um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there C or, I'm not really, what's it called when you do flour, I'm not, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But, E I mean, you think about it, it, D you know, it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just, I'm not really sure C but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean, E or stream or such, C or you can, you can, D you know, do, F uh, testing on the ground itself at that point, C but when they pollute into the air and you've got, D you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off. C So, I don't see, D you know, how they can do some of the te, unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, D you know, like in Los Angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends to get stuck there, you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air, D you know, per, per, F uh, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away, C but, F um, Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, I know out in some, I'm not sure, I can't remember the name of the county it's, it's where Stillwater is or, sweet, no I'm not sure, I know it, I think it's, F uh, I know we have a piece property there, it's called Dublin, it's in Dublin, Texas. I'm not really sure what the county, it's Stephen, no Stephenville. Okay, where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, F um, introduced a lot of dairies there, C so, they have a lot of cattle in the area, E I mean, they've got D like per, per, ya, F uh, per lot, D you know, they've got D like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th, th, it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free, they've got to have them there to be able to milk them. C And they, C and I read in this article, A I couldn't believe it, where, D you know, D like, one cow produces, D like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure. One cow, I was like, my God, C and they, C and this thing says that, that, D you know, it, people think, D well, cow manure is good for fertilizer C but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not, it's not when, D you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it C and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down, C and, C and this, C and this article said that they've got a real problem that, F um, you've got toxins and, and, F uh, bacteria in the manure that is, what it's doing is it's going through, F uh, they don't have a very deep, F um, o, D you know, they're water, they're natural water, F uh, I forget what that's called with, D you know, it's D like a spring, spring water, C but it's below the surface it's not very far down, C and all this stuff is seeping through to the water, C and they're D like, they're afraid that, D you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, they're wa, they're water in that town will be totally polluted, C and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, F um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, D you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth, C and I'm like my God, D you know, just from that one, D you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county. No, not when you figure, I didn't realize a cow, one cow produces that much manure C and they were talking D like, thousands of cows, D you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area. You, D Well, they are evidently. C But, F um, E I mean, ev, evidently a normal cow produces that much too, C but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, D you know, a problem, C but when they get them in these tiny little areas, D you know, and they've got a real big problem, C and they, they said that, that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, F uh, these D like ponds that they had to filter it with, C but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow C and they overflow into the, the creeks and stuff in the area. C So, that just creates, D you know, there, there's, C and, F oh, it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam. People, people stand outside their houses and their, watch the creeks foam brown and all, C and I'm just like, F oh, my gosh, C and the smell is really bad they sa, Yeah, C but I, I don't know it really frightens me though as far as the, when you think about the, D you know, thinking of just air pollution itself C and then, C and, channel thirteen they're really, F um, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, D you know, if we, if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, and, D you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for, F um, just the, the Earth, D you know, what the Earth is receiving back, D you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at. Yeah. The rain forest and all. Yeah. D Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it C and they're synthesizing it for us. Yeah. Yeah, I think we just have to, I don't know personally, D you know, I suppose, D you know, if you just make sure your car is, is working properly C and yo, D you know, they're suppos, nowadays they have the emission controls on them C but, F uh, I think the only, the main thing is just keep on the, legis, your legislators back, D you know, as far as, seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved it, it's really becoming a problem. By the year two thousand there will, what, what are we going to have, what kind of results are we going to have for the environment. C And, C and what will we... Right. I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just, F uh, I think they put off so much C and they're not regulated enough. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. No. Really? F Huh. Oh. Right. I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, E I mean, E or even had chem, D you know, D well, those chemicals would not, Yeah. Right, yeah. Right, D you know, like in, In packaging C and, F uh, D you know, just goodness. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching C but, E I mean, I, I don't know what's, how they do the flour. C But, F um, we, we're on the southwest side of Houston we don't have that much as far as, F uh, aiming in the plants over on this, F uh, the we, east side does. We've got Imperial sugar C but, F uh, C and they're, D you know, they're right there on the creek also C and, F uh, they've been there for years. C And, F uh, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, yeah. Uhhuh. I know that, I worry every now and then, we're still on a well water, we're not on city water, C and I think, D well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, D you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that, Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Oh. It will. Uhhuh, yeah, C and the gr, Right. Right. Yeah, C and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. These are well fed. These are, Good grief, these are well fed cows, F uh, <laughter>, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, D now that's bad. F Oh, <laughter>, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, right. C And then cutting the trees, D you know, that bothers me. As far as, D you know the yes, F uh, we've been wanting to, D well, not me C but, F uh, it's been recommend, E or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here, I'm like, no, D you know, for what's cut down here, D you know, more will be cut down someplace else C and it will just take that longer to grow back, C and trees help so that, F uh, <<very faint>>, I don't, Uhhuh. Right, right, believe me it's just so much better. C So, F uh, yeah, I knew, I think there's lots that be, that could be done to, to improve how things are done now. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right.
