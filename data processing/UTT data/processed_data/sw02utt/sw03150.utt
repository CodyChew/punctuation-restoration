<Static> D Well, it's, I am pretty much against it <breathing> <laughter>. Yeah. How about you? F Oh, good <laughter> we can have a debate. D Well, D like, F um, <lipsmack> I don't know, I c, think that I, one of the reasons that I'm against it is that, F uh, F um, I'm afraid of someone losing their life, for s, F um, wrongly, Right C and, F uh, another reason, one of the arguments, that really, I really D actually have been kind of ambivalent about it, C but one of the arguments that really, F uh, made me feel kind of strongly against it, is that, F uh, <lipsmack> D you know, someone said to me once, D well, imagine if the person you love most in the world, like your mother or something, if someone killed her, wouldn't you want to see them killed <sigh> for the punishment? C But then I thought about it C and I thought, D well, the loss that I would feel at losing my mother <talking> someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were, somebody loves them <laughter> <talking>. How about you? Yeah, that's true. Uhhum. Right. D Well D you know that's true, because F um m b a lot of F um these conversations I've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around F um <lipsmack> criminal D you know justice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C Or D whatever C and most of the time I hear myself saying D well D you know we don't have enough room left in the jails C and people crime is still climbing C and we need to have different punishments D you know. C but I just am scared of capital punishment, I guess. Uhhuh. Right. Especially when it's so far removed. If it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life. Letting him out again <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's true. D You know, I just recently moved to Massachusetts. I'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment C and that was one of the questions C but, F uh, I do know that they are notorious for paroling <laughter> people. Yeah, when they're, when, C and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes. C And, I guess, they said, D you know, sh, do you think it should be restricted? I guess, if it were, if, if, because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense. D You know, violent crimes with no, F uh, with just malicious intent. Yeah. Hang? <laughter>. C And what is he going to do prison to the other people <laughter>? Right. D Well, I was, I saw on a human interest story, or whatever today, there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back, she was off drugs and everything, C but she said, F uh, D you know, in prison you can get <sigh> anything. You can any drugs you want. There's, it, it's just like being outside. D You know, people find ways around. C And there's a power structure that you have bow to C and, C and, it really isn't, for some people tha, who have been there for over, and over, and over, it really isn't, F uh, as bad. E I mean, there's, it's not that bad of a life as it should be b, for the punishment aspect. C But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation C and <swallowing> maybe that's why, one of the reasons why crime has gone up, because it's not so scary anymore. Right. C And what they're going to be doing when they get out <laughter>. Handed it to you? <laughter> <Cough> <<in background>>. F Oh, F oh, I see. <Laughter>. D Well, maybe if they could, F uh, if they had more money or more, more resources to <noise> work more on rehabilitation, E I mean, deep down I think every, every human <static>, <Static> <Children> D So, how do you feel about capital punishment? Really? F Oh, I'm pretty much for it. <Laughter> We'll have some interesting discussion, I guess. Wrongfully. Yeah. Yeah. <Children>. Yeah, it would never be equal, Right. Right. Yeah. D Well, I guess, D you know, I, I guess I can see it from several different perspectives, C but, D you know when I hear about things like, D you know, what they've, what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee, D you know I, I, to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy. D You know, maybe there is, I don't know. C But, D you know, C and, D you know, he's never going to be, to me, a functioning part of society. He's already been C either paroled, C or whatever, for child molestation. E I mean, I don't know, I just, I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko. C And, D you know, for the things he's done, I don't know, I guess it's C either, D you know, put him in jail for the rest of his life, D you know, C or C or capital punishment I guess. D You know an <lipsmack> <breathing> and Uhhuh. F Oh, really. <Bell> <Children>. Right. Yeah. <breathing> D Well I can underst E I I mean you know there there is always that chance C but D you know I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I don't E I mean I don't know C but F uh, D you know, C but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be, D you know you you you really throw a lot on the courts, hopefully that they won't do that D you know for any for any situation really. C But, F uh, D you know, when I, you find somebody just like that situation, E I mean, it was disgusting when I read about it today. C And, C and when you find someone like that, that you know is guilty, he confessed already to killing eleven I, I'd, D you know, I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him, C and D you know. Right. Right. Right. C And trying to rehabilitate him, too, C and, D you know, Right, exactly. C And, F uh, D you know, nobody wants that. D You know, everybody would be just as scared to death, D you know. We, we've had a real problem here in Texas with, F uh, prison overcrowding C and they've been releasing people left and right C and, D you know, they've committed murders and rapes and everything else, C and, D you know, you just think, D you know, where's the justice here. E I mean, D you know, they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, exactly. Yeah. D Well, D you know, that's exactly, E I mean, I'm, I'm not saying I, I think capital murder E or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, D you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know C and I, I think there's a, a shadow of a doubt, D you know, like with this, this guy in, in Milwaukee. E I mean, it, he pretty much confessed to it. E I mean, they, D you know, just everything, E I mean, cannibalism and everything else, F uh, I really would have a hard time, especially if I was on a jury, not wanting him to, D you know, be executed. Yeah. Because, E I mean, that's just awful. Right. D Well, I have a hun, I have a hunch that, D you know, the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway. Either, E I mean, D you know they, I don't know, from, from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live. C But, F uh, I don't know. It's just, Uhhuh. Really. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That, Yeah. D Well, D you know, especially like repeat offenders. It, it just appalls me that they can be out, D you know, they even get a ten year sentence and be out in, in two, or three, or four years. D You know, that's, that's scary because, D you know, I'm not sure, I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're, D you know, going to be committing any more violent acts or not. Right. C And, it, it's, it's really scary <children>. I me, D you know, I, I don't know what the perfect solution to that is C but I know that especially with violent crimes where, D you know, you're nearly a hundred percent <children> convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else, D you know, then, I don't know, I, I guess, I, I just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee, D you know. For instance, E I mean, that's just, I could see capital punishment in a case like that. And, D you know, for, for other people, too, that do things, like that. C But, F uh, when, F uh, my wife and I are both participating in this survey C and she picked up the phone C and when she <laughter> heard the topic, she said, capital punishment, C so she was, F uh, Yeah, <laughter> D well luckily it was for me. Because they want, th, they coordinate the times so it can, only be one or the other. C So, she tried to enter her number C and it wouldn't work C so she said, whew, it's for you. C So, C but, F uh, D you know, I don't know, I, I struggle with it, C but I, I really think that in, in terms of D like this, I'd, I think that it, it might not be <noise> such a bad thing. Because, I don't know that anybody, w, in, I don't know that anybody would feel good, D you know, D like if you let someone like that loose in your community. D You know, I, I, I'm su, you'd have to be scared to death <static>.
