Okay. F Um, I like watching COLOMBO and, F um, MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP, yeah. Uhhuh. F Um, uhhuh. Yeah, that one was. What about, Uhhuh, yeah. F Oh, I, D well I haven't seen either of those <laughter>. Huhuh. F Um, I also like to watch STAR TREK, C but it's on so late here, that I don't always get to see it <laughter>. F Uh, <baby_talking> I haven't seen any of the movies <laughter> because I just barely, just D like in the last year or so got interested in it, C and they're, D you know, already out with number six by now, C but. C So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet, C but I. <Laughter> No. Uhhuh. Yeah, I've seen quite a few of the older ones. I haven't seen really the new generation that much. Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the youn, the newer one? F Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do too. I have a brotherinlaw who really likes the old ones a lot, E I mean, he almost hates the new ones <laughter>. Yeah, C because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something, C but, <laughter> I don't <laughter>. F Oh, I think, Yeah. Yeah, sure. D Well, let's see. F Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing. That's sort of how Matlock is, C but COLOMBO is way tricky <laughter> E I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them. D Well, did you see the one. F Um. F Um, yeah, there's D like one on, D well we see it Thursdays at seven, C and it was, this last time it was about this, F um, movie director, did you hap, did you see that? Really? F Oh, I guess I nev, F Huh. F Oh, I guess I've, I haven't seen it before. Yeah yeah, on the set or something. Yeah, it was. C But, yeah, I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things. C But, F um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though <laughter>. I don't think so. D Well, STAR TREK'S on at five, C but I'm never home C so, Oh. I've heard of it a lot, I've heard of, a lot of people somehow or something <clanking>. They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, D you know. <Laughter> Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, did they end the whole series? Oh. Oh. F Oh, another show I like to watch is MASH. D So, what are your favorite shows? F Oh, really? QUANTUM LEAP? Did you see it the other night? That was, that was pretty good. What do you, with the psychic and everything? Okay. Yeah, I like, F uh, I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, F uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT. You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE? <Baby_talking> F Oh, it's a great show. <Baby_talking> Really? Yeah, we like it, too. Have you seen the movie? F Oh, you haven't seen any of them. F Oh, D well, they're good, they're real good. They're, F uh, they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies, though. Which ones are you watching, the new ones? F Oh, okay. Yeah. D Well, they're, <breathing> they're a lot different. C But, I like, I like the older ones because at that time, D you know, they were really futuristic, D you know. C And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real <laughter> futuristic, too, C but I like, I like both of them. Really? No. Not really. It's not really like a soap opera, C but, C but it's, C but that's true, E I mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff, C but that's the way all shows are now. Yeah. Yeah. <Throat_clearing> D Well, it seems like they always show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though A you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college, C or is this, is there a series on. Okay. Yeah, I saw that one. D See, that was a rerun. Yeah, I wondered if that's D see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what, C but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones, C and then, then they keep showing them over and over. He was a movie director, C and he had that gal killed. Okay. That was pretty good though <laughter>. Uhhuh. No kidding. What is it that, there's something I watch, something I watch on Saturdays, C and I can't remember what it is. D Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS. You never saw that? Yeah, yeah that was a different soap opera. C But, it was, it was a different type of show. I didn't like the way it ended, though. Yeah. Yeah, they didn't, they only did it for, I think, two years. C But it's all over now.
