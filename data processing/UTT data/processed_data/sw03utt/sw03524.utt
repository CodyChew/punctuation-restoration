I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia. F Oh, do they have one? F Oh, I didn't know that. D Well, I learned something already <laughter>. How much time do you spend with your children? Oh <laughter>. What? F Oh, yeah, D well, mine is, F uh, down at U T Austin at college C and the other one is in high school. C So you do spend less time then? C, <Laughter> They want to be with their friends. How old are your kids? Are they married or what? <Laughter>. F Oh, <laughter> D boy, you have a lot of kids. F Oh, D well, that's kind of nice, though. You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, F huh? D Well, that's true. They have to see their other parent, I guess too. I know. What? I know <laughter>. That's what my mother said one time. Right. No, that's true, C and if they force them to, D you know that's not good either. D Well, do they all live in the area? Uhhuh, F oh, wow. Uhhuh. Golly. How did they end up so far away? Uhhuh. Those are the youngest ones? Uhhuh. D Boy, that's, those are a long way. How, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Vermont. C So they wanted to make their homes there. My goodness. Are they, are those two married? They, F uh, just working up there or going to school or what? Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think. E I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T C and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself C so <laughter> it's never too late. Right. Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students. F Oh, yeah, I've seen some people that are really quite up there <laughter> D you know they look like in their very late sixties C and I say that's great, why not, D you know. No. F Oh, yeah, you're really ready to learn finally. E I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen. It was a complete waste of money. Right, right. We, Right C and, F uh, No. We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning <laughter>. We're past, D yeah, we're past that age <laughter>. We know what we can do <laughter>. Uhhuh. What was it, F uh, h, what do the trends in families C and do we approve what other, families do. That's right. A change? I was going to say the same thing. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Are going to have to solve some of the problem, F huh. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, my, yeah. D Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois. Yes, they do. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, let's see, the three questions are what, F uh, Very little. Because they're grown. They're grown and gone. F Huh. Yeah C because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us. F Uh, yes, I have, F uh, two married, two almo, C and then two almost married C and the other two, I'm not sure. D Well, Two s, two, two, F uh, F uh, for sure are single. Yeah, we have, between the spouse and myself we have six. C Because I came with a split family C and she had, D Well, no, there is so much of them are gone C and they're doing their own things C and C and a lot of times they, they've got, D you know, F uh <breathing>, when the holidays, Yeah C and sometimes they want to do their own thing, C so sometimes it's just spouse and me. C And, C and you know what? Sometimes that's okay. C Because, D You know, right, C because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays. Yeah. That becomes a drudgery C and, D Well, let's see, n, got, of the six, we've got four around here. F Uh, D you know, D well, we're talking like north Texas. C And then, one is in Vermont, F uh, Montpe, Mont, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont C and the other one is in Everett, Washington. <Laughter> D Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. C And my second marriage. F Uh, C and, F uh, Yeah, D well, the s, the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, F uh, six are the two that are scattered like that. C And, D Well, they wanted to go, F uh, J R, my, my, my last son E or my middle son, E excuse me, fell in love with Washington state C and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, F uh, F uh, Vermont. C So, Yeah, that's where they've gone to make their homes. No. D Well, F uh, let's see, yeah, I guess you'd say J R is working, going to s, trying to go to school. I wish to God he would go back. Yeah. D Well, I certainly hope so. Uhhuh. D Well, it's, F oh, I agree it's never too late. C And, Yeah, C and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up. Uhhuh. F Oh, my, uhhuh. Yes, why not because that's a, a lot of times, D well, it's, I believe that, F uh, we in that category, C and I'm not in that category quite yet C but, we are seasoned minds. Yes, uhhuh. Yeah, it was, Yeah, settle down, we know what we're wanting to, to, F uh, study C and, F uh we know our limitations. C And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether. At seven, yeah. Yes, we're, we're smarter now. Yeah, right, F uh, C so let's see. C So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here. <Lipsmack> C And so the second question, forgot what the second question, <Breathing>. D Well, F uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing. C But I have seen lately, D yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, D whoops, government can't do it, schools are not able to C and between a person's religion, F uh, their, their faith in their maker w, whether, D you know, F uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever, F uh, C and the family those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal C and, of course, JudeoChristianity, F uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, F uh, F uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing.
