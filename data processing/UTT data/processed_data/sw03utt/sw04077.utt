How do you feel about gun control? F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, don't you think that D you know, just having, D you know, some, D you know almost like a driver's license be required D you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with D you know a gun that is not registered or D you know that you are not licensed to carry. E I mean, It varies from State to State. There is no national, F Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. D You know or on probation or, F uh, D you know, other obvious things like that. F Uh, C and I know, I know that D like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. D You know, be, be obviously insane, C and then, you, D you know C but have your legal right to get a gun. F Uh, yeah, I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five. <Laughter> Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, D you know. Uhhuh <inhaling>. Uhhuh. <Smack> D Well, D you know, F uh, F uh, no, if you are looking at D like D you know country that, F uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, D you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much. D Well E I mean yeah. The, F uh, the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States. F Uh, <inhaling> D you know, E I mean, the problem though, D you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, D you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, D you know, if you were introduced, D you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already. D You know, C so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem. <Inhaling> F Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is. I've, I've not really had that many problems with it, C but E I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up. F Uh. E I mean, I think, D you know, in the te, E I mean I think we have been D like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years. Uhhuh. <Smack> No. I've thought about getting one. If I get one, I think I will probably, D you know, get something. I probably wouldn't get a hand gun. I would probably get D like a shotgun. Just for protecting myself. D You know, from burglar type thing. I do kind of live in the downtown area. D You know C and shotguns are really good because they're, E I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and D you know, use it to mug someone, D you know. F Uh, C and D you know, you, yeah, I just don't understand these people, D you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves. They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through D you know, they are probably going to miss the person C and, C and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, D you know. E I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being D you know a real good defensive weapon. You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of D you know whoever. You pretty much stop them. C And, you don't, then the actual shot doesn't go that far, D you know, a wall will stop it pretty much. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Noise> Uhhuh. <Inhaling>. Yeah, that, that really does scare me. People, D you know, that have guns because D you know, if you ever get in the situation where D you know you are not prepared to shoot, C but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that, that person rushes you. C And D you know, you're pretty much dead D you know. Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then, D You know C and, C and, D well E I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that D you know unless he, unless, D you know that you are a real danger to them C and then D you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, D you know their first reaction is going to be D you know, stop you. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah, the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something? Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, E I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed C but it's going to, a lot of the stuff that, E I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, C But I don't really know, E I mean, unless they do, F uh, just outlaw them, how you can, F uh, prevent that. Yeah, that, D well do you even know what the procedures are now? F Um. C But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it. Yeah. F Huh. I didn't know that. D Well, that's pretty scary. C So, does, D now do they want us to say where we feel about it, D like in rating it one to ten. <Laughter> That's where I would probably be <laughter>. D Well, E I mean, E I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better C because E I mean I do think that some people need them and, D like, for protection and stuff C and I can understand them wanting to have them, C but then again it's just like all those nuts out there. It has? C Because then, F Um. Yeah. D Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta? Yeah I know Dallas is. I don't know if Dallas is in the top three C but. Do you own a gun? Uhhuh. Yeah. That's true. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, D Well, now when I first moved to Dallas, I moved up here by myself C and, F uh, my Dad gave me a gun C but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it C so I finally ended up giving it back to him. I said I don't want it. I don't want to be responsible for it because D you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, D you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it. Yeah. C And they get it from you. Uhhuh. Set them off. Yeah, D well that's why I ended up giving it back to him. I thought D well D you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to oper, D you know, if I don't really know how to use it C and I just didn't want the responsibility. C So. D Well, F uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever? Yeah, right. That kind of E I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns. I would be scared selling guns to people.
