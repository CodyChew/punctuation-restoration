<Laughter> What are you afraid of with them? Yes. <Laughter>. D Well, that's very, can be very, very true. D Well, that's the idea. They figure that, if they give you card, at no charge for a whole year that you will use it C and, Absolutely. D Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month, so that you would be paying interest. I use mine a great deal, F um, for groceries, for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month, for the entire thing, right. That's all right. Sounds like you have a little one there. F Oh, you have. Great. How old are they? F Oh, boy. Those are two very active ages <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, do you, F uh, do you ever use the A T M machines? <Laughter> D Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks, in order to get cash. F Oh, that helps. Right. D Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash C and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on. Yeah right. Absolutely. C Because they, they figure that, that's correct <laughter>. The idea is to use their money <laughter>. C And, F uh, during that whole month and, then pay it at the end of the month. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and, not be tempted. D Well, i, F oh, absolutely, preapproved. That's their favorite word. <Laughter> I think so, you're right. D Well, it's interesting, F uh, that, F uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go. That much stuff. Right. D Well, C and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own, C and, E I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem. That's right. That's right. D Well it's been enjoyable talking with you. Right. D Well take good care. Take care of your little ones. Uhhuh. Byebye. D Well, F um, with credit cards is, me, I, F uh, I try to get maybe just one or two, I don't, I don't like having credit cards for every store. I, I, F uh, I just don't like them <laughter>. What am I afraid of? F Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much. I just, F uh, don't think that I need them, D you know. I, F uh, they are tempting at times, C but I, I just, D you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, D you know, C so, C So, C and th, D you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money C so, Yeah. Uhhuh. That's right. D See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not. <Child>. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's what I do. That's what I do. Just a second. <<Talking to child in background.>> Sorry <Child>. I have two little ones. Yes. Yeah. D So tha, F um, four and two and half. <Laughter> Yes. C So, yeah, F um, I'm, I'm like you I, I use my, only use my credit card for, F um, D you know, when I, D you know, I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check, C and then, C but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month. D So, No, I never do. My husband does at work just to get cash out, C but, F uh, I take the checkbook C so I, D you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him C and he gets it out C and I don't even think I know my number <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's right. D See we, he couldn't do without it, h, but, D you know, since he can just do it right there at work, for nothing. Yeah. Uhhuh. You're right. C And that's kind of silly. Yeah. Your defeating the purpose. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, E I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week. People, t, D you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it. C Because I, Yeah. It's like, I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. D You know. You've already been preapproved. Yes. Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think. D So, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, D you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much, D you know, I'd spent this much money. C And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it. Uhhuh. Yeah, it does because you're, D you know, you, you're, D you know, you're just co, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest, again C so, Yeah C so, Yeah. It's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the same way, C so, D well, You, you too. Good luck. Byebye.
