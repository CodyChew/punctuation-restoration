<Beep>. D So where was your last vacation? <laughter>. F Oh, I, I'd, D well actually I did visit Hawaii once C but I never made it off of Oahu, which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh that's, wow. Yeah. F Oh I've be, <laughter> I've been lots of places. My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess we, that one would count, F Uh, that was about a year and a half ago, C and, F Uh, D well my husband is French C and we were living in France at the time C and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa C and I needed to get that continent since I <laughter>, hadn't been there yet. C And it, it's, D actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go C and they speak French C and, C so, F uh, D you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier C and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. C And, C So we, we didn't really have enough time. We had about, a little bit less than two weeks. C And as always, it don, it seems a bit, F uh, rushed. We do a lot of traveling around. We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere. No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was, D well we were there in the winter. In Jan, F uh, January or February, I don't remember which, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. At wha, at, <cough> E excuse me, at what age did you, F Oh, that's too bad C because, Uhhuh <laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. It was a very interesting vacation. The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas F uh, F um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide C and you, there were some places, where people, defini, there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off, C and we had nothing taken because we knew C and we had things in inside pockets and in, D you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah. The, the worst place was in Marrakech C and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad C and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities C and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide it doesn't matter who it is C and they keep everyone else away from you. C And it's worth it C and it's like ten dollars a day or something C and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you C and you feel stupid doing that C but we did it, C and we were much happier, C and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, F uh, F Uh <laughter>, Yes. No D actually I haven't been all through Europe, like I haven't been to Italy yet. F Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September C and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too. F Uh, my more exciting spots have been, I've been to the Galapagos Islands. Uhhuh, that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had. Yes. If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation. If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest <laughter>. C But it, that was really, really fabulous C and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close, F Um, August, eightyeight. C And then, D actually, after there I went to F um, Hawaii, a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings C and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China, I, I, D actually I didn't go diving. I, I'm a diver C and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips C but, F uh, no I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef. I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Au, Adelaide. It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. The coastline was just incredible. It's huge. Australia. Yeah. F Uh, C but, I don't remember if I had shrimp. I don't think so. <Laughter> F Oh, I like that too. C But, F uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it D like in the van, with a bunch of people. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. C And I was by myself in China too. Yeah. China was a little bit more, F uh, of a challenge. C But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time, C and so I never, D you know, got out by myself, or not much, No, D actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, no maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare C and, C but this is from Hong Kong, C because I was already in Hong Kong C and, F um, C but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there C and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu C and D actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, F uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride. C And that, I had two internal, one, D yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. It was really, Uhhuh. Around a thousand. F Oh, Japa, Japan's ridiculous. C And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels C but I stayed in, they were all completely clean, C and, D you know, they were newly built C and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff. Right. Right. F Uh, C but yeah, that was, tha, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston <laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, C and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China C and she just gave me this woman's name to contact C and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide C and then, F Uh, D actually my last vacation was in Connecticut. F Uh, we went home to visit family. Before that we were in Hawaii. Oh. It wasn't actually. It, w, when we were in Oah, Oahu, F uh, I couldn't wait to get off <laughter>. We, we took a cruise C and we went to four different islands C and it was a really nice, Kauai was nice and Maui was nice. We had, we had a great time. We were there for ten days. Yeah, yes. C So where have you been? Morocco. Really. No kidding. C An, what, what, did you just decide to go there C or, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh I'm sure it was wonderful. Uhhuh. Was it hot? Really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I was born in Saudi Arabia C and, F uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around D you know, in, in Europe and whatnot, C but I was very young C so I don't remember that C and, I was three when we moved back here. C So I don't remember C but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been <laughter>, C and that I was when I was a baby C but C so, Morocco I think would be wonderful C because that's, D you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Really. We, we found that in Jamaica. It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, D well try and sell drugs and things like that C but they, they were so destitute C and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism C and, C and they would come up and ask you, D you know, if, if you want to buy different things C and really, after awhile it really gets annoying, D you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh really. Really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well that's great. Where else have you been? D Well you lived in France, C so you've been all through Europe. No. Really. Uhhuh. Really? Lots of wildlife F huh? Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Now when was that, when were you there? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Did you go on the Barrier Re, did you see the Great Barrier Reef and, and go snorkeling? Uhhuh. F Oh diving. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is it really? Yeah, yeah. Did you have shrimp? I've seen in, D you know, they, they show all this wonderful seafood and, and great big prawns, D you know the big shrimp C and, No? Didn't have shrimp there F huh <laughter>? I remember food <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh you're adventurous. You went by yourself. Really. Really? F Oh wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Was it very expensive? You're kidding! No kidding! Uhhuh. Uhhuh. All for a thousand dollars? Wow! That really surprises me. I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they? Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, C and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're, Yeah, yeah. Wow. F Oh really. Uhhuh.
