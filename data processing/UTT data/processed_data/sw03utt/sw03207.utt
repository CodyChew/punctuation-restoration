F Um, I don't, I am only twentyeight C and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes. I don't, I have never visited any of them C and, F uh, I don't think I've ever even been in one. Have you? Uhhuh. C And it, it takes a lot of care D like twentyfour hours a day someone, has to be, D Well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family. His grandmother too and they're, that hi, her son, his uncle, whatever, D you know, D anyway. He, he has, he's recently retired C and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke C and, C and all the other children are working or whatever. They're all my parents age. C And, F uh, C so he's got, D you know, his retirement though is really twentyfour hours a day. They have a day care two days a week. They call it senior citizen day care. C But she goes in the senior citizen center. C So sh, he gets a break two days a week C but it's only for like two or three hours at a time. C And, D you know, just, you see a lot of things like D you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired, C and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now. C But he refuses to consider any other, I don't, Yeah, C and is that how your parents feel C or, <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I know at this, I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either, D you know. C But I, I really feel bad for the people I see th, not very, I'm not really, really experienced C but like I said I just have that one family, C and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now C and, than he thought it would be. C But, Yeah, C and he's got, D you know, seven brothers and sisters C and, C and, F uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone. C And, F Oh, D well, that's great. That's a good idea. We ought to, Yeah, C and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I don't know what they're going to do. It's really not my family. It's my fiancee's C so I don't, I can't say much. C But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either C and I wonder, I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children C so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for. D You know, C and I'm, I, that's fine with me. I, my fiancee and I both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever. If the, You know what I mean? We feel like, it's our responsibility, C and I feel like I would never put them in a home. C But I wonder how much, D you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something. You think about it C and it's really, I don't know. This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country. C And, It's really more of a, F um, like a respect issue th, that the older, older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people C and, C and they really seem as wise C and, C and in this country nobody really, D Yeah, nobody really pays attention C and they, F oh, the oldtimer made with the old way C and nobody respects the traditions. C And, D you know, it's I, I'm not saying that I do either C but <laughter> D you know, it's just funny C and, C and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security C and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on. D You know, even if they're in good health it's incredible. They don't have any, they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, D you know because we're all going to get old someday. C And so it's a, it's kind of a depressing <laughter> topic though. How old are you? C So it is, D yeah, C and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother. . F Um, D actually I have, F um, I've, I've been in them but, F um, just visiting C and, F uh, we used to g, when we were D like in, in our teen ages we'd go on Sundays and visit, D you know, the older people. C But, F um, I have an elderly grandma that lives with us. C And she's lived with us for D like five years. C So I kind of know how it is to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home C or, F um, D like we, E I mean we've had those discussions, D you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile C and <laughter>, Yeah. It's rea, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Right. To put her in a rest home? F Um, <throat_clearing> D well, D see it's more my grandma that feels that way. She says that when her husband died that he said, F oh, that my uncle had said that he would never ha, put her in a rest home. C So it's kind of, F uh, I don't know. E I mean, I don't, I don't think my parents would C but she is getting pretty bad D like she has to have D like a little toilet right by her bed C and, it's, C and my mom has to take care of her pretty much C so it gets, I don't know. It's, it's a hard decision, C but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally <laughter>. When he retired? Yeah, it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months C and then he has her for three months. C So that, that works out good. Uhhuh. Really? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You think? I, I I'm not really familiar with how other countries, They're seen as senile <laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. I know. F Um, I'm twenty. Yeah, it's, it really is C but, C and she, she drives us craz,
