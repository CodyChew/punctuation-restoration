Yeah, the question was, F uh, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, F uh, F uh, <laughter> I guess, Okay <laughter>. With two little kids I can understand that. F Oh <laughter>. What, F uh, what kind of, F Huh. Oh. Uhhuh. By, F uh, somebody who was there C or, Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, any of the guys that were ground yes. Yeah, I can imagine. D Well, I tell you what, I'm a kind of, F uh, a history nut. I'm trying to think back now, I read an awful lot of, F uh, periodicals and, F uh, D you know, almost what you call reference books. C And, F uh, the last, F uh, I'm embarrassed to say the last, D you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, A I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, F uh, one of the, the Michener, F uh, LONE STAR or the, the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK. F Oh, D well, I've had similar problems. It does tend to, to, Yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there? Yeah, D well, it was a political move. It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, D you know, it was, F uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, F uh, in rebellion against the United States. All the other areas which would, I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, F oh, may have been Kentucky, a few states, D you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves. They didn't emancipate them. Uhhuh. I've got the same problem <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Mayb, isn't much there, was there? Right. They supplied some, F uh, D you know, they were some groups of it, the Vicksburg, if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg, the battleground at Vicksburg, F uh, there's an area there where there was, F uh, some Texas, F uh, groups C and they had an interesting time there. C And down there at Sabine Pass, F uh, I can't think of the guy's name C but he held off, F uh, D you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story. <Laughter> That could be it <laughter>, could be it. C And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde, D you know, over there on the Texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for Mexico C and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at Eagle Pass. C And they didn't get across the river there C so they're, the last, C and that was actually after the war was over C but it was the last, organized battle between the two units was in Texas, C so. Yeah, Texas participation in the Civil War was, F uh, minor at, F uh, <laughter> it's been, Yeah. Yeah, D well, my wife's from Galveston, C so. Yeah. D Well, I'm from New Mexico C so, D you know, I was <laughter>, Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> F Huh. It sounds like Iowa or something. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, on, yeah. F Oh, D well, my sister's living in Illinois right now, C so <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. I've always kind of enjoyed it. I, I used to read a lot more than I do now. Uhhuh. Yeah. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. I just turned around and looked at my brief, at my briefcase, my, F uh, bookcase up here C and I see ARMAGEDDON up there. C And, F uh, the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR <laughter>, F oh, SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE, James Michener. Didn't get very far on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it really the, the books are kind of, F uh, imposing to say the least. No, let's see, here's one called GHOST TOWNS AND MINING CAMPS OF NEW MEXICO D now, not too many people have read that one I don't think. C And there's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY, TEXAS there. I've got, F uh, Yeah, C and I've got, D yeah, C and I've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY, IOWA D Well, C because that's where my folks all came from. <Laughter> C And they had a centennial here awhile back. I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND, that was pretty good. That was part of that trilogy that, F uh, Bruce Canton did. Yeah. Sometimes it's awful hard, some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting, they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, D you know, the, <Laughter>. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh, you're reading DUNE. <Laughter>. That was a movie too, wasn't it? Was it? Yeah, I'd, I didn't see it C but, F uh, yeah. Patrick Stewart was in that. I guess the guy that's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing, F uh <laughter>. F Oh, really? <laughter>. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Couldn't, <Laughter>. Yeah. F Um, D well, some history, books are pretty scary, C but, yeah <laughter>. No. Somebody who, saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen, they didn't sleep all night. Yeah. Yeah, I have, no, F uh, I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about, C so. Okay, yeah <laughter>. C But, Uhhuh, that's the one. Even better than JAWS and some of that? <Laughter>. Yeah. Oh. A, a Freddy Kruger type, F huh? F Oh the worst kind, yeah, yeah. F Oh, I just read for escape. D Well, E I mean it's, Yes. It's that's simple. I read to escape, C and I don't read any PARENTS magazines either. C So. D Well, I just finished, just, I just finished one last night. A great book. It, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien. C And it's, F uh, God I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories. Strange book. Beautifully written. Just beautifully written. Yeah, a guy who was there as a, F uh, foot soldier. C So, he considered himself to be, D you know, a, a true Vietnam soldier. Yeah. D So, what's the latest one you've read? Uhhuh. I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work. Have you, are you a Civil War buff at all? C Because I finished one, I think this is D like two years ago, C and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the Civil War, John Jakes with, C and the novel didn't do that much for me. C But, D boy, the period of time was fascinating. C So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, C or, yeah, I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM. It's kind of like a historical compendium, of the Civil War, C and it's not a story of the Civil War, it's a story of all the politics and, F uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events, that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War. C And it's fascinating because I had always, D you know, been raised on this, D you know, Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War. There was a lot more to it than that. As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, you know what else really surprised me, now I'm married to a native Texan C and I'm not. F Uh, yeah, I'm glad you put it that way. C And I have two native Texan children too. My husband is always, D you know, talked about th, Texas being a, F uh, rebel state. And, A F oh, my God, all this Civil War pride. I kept waiting for, where's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War. They might as well have not even been there. D You know, they weren't a state C and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, D you know, who's going to be going there. C And I keep telling my husband that, C and he keeps saying, F oh, no. I thought, okay. F Oh, I'll bet they did. D Well, D you know, why they actually held them off? None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar <laughter>. D Now, you didn't hear me say that. Outside of, F uh, Yeah. Oh. Boy, don't tell that to a native Texan though, E I mean, my god, they fought and won the whole thing. Oh. That's a beautiful state. That's a beautiful state. See I was raised in the Midwest which, D you know, D hell, we didn't even, D you know, we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was, C and besides, D you know, if corn didn't grow there, it didn't matter. Iowa and Nebraska. Yep. C And then I had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts C so, D you know. What does that make me, an honorary Yankee C or, God knows what. D Well then, she's going to come out well rounded. C But outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that I've really gotten into reading, C and I think this is because the kids are getting to me, is science fiction. D Well, I've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, I get out D like, D you know, two or three books. C And I, I'm trying to think of, F oh, Isaac Asimov, ROBOT series. E I mean, I think I've read all four of them C and I understand that there's a fifth. In the last <laughter> six weeks he's been on the road a lot. D You know, I think I read HAWAII, when I was about ten years old C or C so. Which is about the developmental level that, D you know, you need to be at to read those things, C and I still even then I was so, so disgusted with it I, I tried to read, I don't remember which other one it was, whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller. C And I just, I got about D like a hundred pages through it and realized I had D like a thousand more, I thought, I can't do this. Yeah. No. <Laughter>. Is that a big, thick book? What the, what the hell for? Why Kingsley, Iowa? F Oh, okay. D Well, Now that's one that, That's one I don't know. D See, I had never really been into science fiction that much until, F uh, somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago. I don't know if I'd call it science fiction or fantasy. D Well, I loved that novel. C And then somebody said, F oh, God, this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston C and it was raining all night, C and I had a hole in my roof C and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse, and, F uh, I was reading DUNE. Which seeming rather ironic. C And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out, D you know, D like tengallon buckets of, of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and, reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits C and, I think that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read. C And the movie was awful. F Oh, yes, it was just terrible. It was, it was beyond, F uh, I don't know, I just remember Sting was in it. Yeah, C and if you were trying to follow any type of, F uh, plot, it, it total, even having read the book, and I've read that book probably three times, watching that movie, I couldn't figure out, what they were talking about, at all. I was real disappointed in that. D Well, I'll tell you another good book, do you like scary things? Have you, That's true. Have you read, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? Oh. D Well, D see I, I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book. E I mean the book is, is chilling. Just chilling. Then I won't tell you. It's just that if you're ever, ever really want to just be scared out of your wits, That's the one. Yes. Yes, C because the cat, the, the character that is so horrible is another human being. C And you're just drawn into his, his horror, of him that you, begin to kind of like him. E I mean, No, no. This guy's smart C and he's suave C and he's all the charac, all the, characteristics, yeah, all the characteristics...
