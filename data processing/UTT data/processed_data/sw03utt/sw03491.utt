D Well, F uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE. Yeah <laughter>, yeah. Yeah. I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six. No, I found that out <laughter>. How about yourself? How is it? F Oh, I can't wait. D Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys? No, it's just the old guys still. You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, E no, it was U S A TODAY that they said they weren't going to do anymore. That was it. C But, F Huh. I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was. F Huh. F Oh, that's right. Is that right? He was a doctor still? D Well, yeah, he didn't look too bad, did he? Yeah, that's amazing. C But, did they have some pretty good special effects? Yeah, FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad <laughter>. No, I don't. Why? F Oh, is that right? F Uh, L, Leonard, s, Nimoy, he does a lot better. IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, E or, E no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was. Are, you're a real life Trekkie? I really like them. I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie, C but F uh, F Oh, really? F Huh, did you get to talk to him? It was crowded. No. Yeah. Wow. F Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION. Oh. Right, C so he kind of was a cowboy type, too. Made all the decisions C but, F uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management. What other movies have you seen? F Oh, how was that? Lots of little funny spots, F huh. Did they have Thing C and, Really? How did, I've always wondered how he gets around. C But he's in a box, right? Didn't he used to? Oh. F Oh, that's, D yeah, that's, okay. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. D Well, let me see, what have you seen lately? FIVE? Y, only, only five? <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> D Well, no, didn't need to. <Laughter>. I just saw the latest one. It was fantastic. Yeah, it's, the lines in there were just perfect. E I mean, it was classic TREK. No, huhuh. Yeah, it was just a rumor that that would happen this time. However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might, C but it may not include the entire crew C and it will be a next generation meets this generation <throat_clearing>. D So, I think it's a hundred years. Somewhere in that range. Considering that Spock was on an, F uh, D you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy. C And, Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, D you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, D you know, C and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow. Vulcans age a lot better <laughter>. No, huhuh. Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, F uh, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK <laughter>. Imagine that. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, excellent, excellent special effects. C But I think the script was, D you know, just incredible compared to the last one. D Well, you know why? F Uh, William Shatner wrote it. C And even worse, he directed it. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah, he, in fact, F uh, he didn't direct this one. He produced this one <throat_clearing>. C But he directed the one before, F uh, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that. Yeah, uhhuh. L, I think so <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I've gone to, D you know, one for real live Trek Convention C but, Yeah, I saw James Doohan, D you know, the guy that plays, F uh, Scotty. No <laughter>. Not in a crowd like that. Huhuh. It was like, F uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> It was a pretty crowded place. F Oh, yeah, yeah, I, it's, it's kind of funny. I, F uh, was reading in, F uh, a book. F Uh, trying to think, I can't quite remember the name of the book, C but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style. C And they were referring to, D you know, Captain Kirk, every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell. <Laughter> C And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship <laughter>. Uhhuh <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh, yeah, F uh, it's definitely a lot better <laughter>. A lot more realistic really. F Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week. <Throat_clearing> It was pretty good. F Uh, there were a few things different than the old series, C but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, <breathing> a lot of fun. F Oh, yeah, yeah. F Oh, yes, in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series. E I mean, D you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day. C And he runs around a lot. F Uh, D you know, just finger hopping. <Laughter> No, no, no, in fact, it's funny. He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think. Yeah, he was just kind of walking around. Not really. He was always in the box before. Yeah.
