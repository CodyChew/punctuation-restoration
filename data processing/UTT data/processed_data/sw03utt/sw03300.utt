F Uh, I guess, <laughter> I don't know. It's the first time I've made a phone call on it. Right. I read, F uh, a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, F uh some Danielle Steel. My aunt got me hooked on those <laughter>. C So I, Yeah, they're all novels. I'll read some, F uh, classic, too. F Uh, <breathing> like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck. I'll, F uh, A, A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites. F Oh, C and this, this is more of a play or something that, that it was from, that, that I saw C and I read the book from that. C And, by the way, my name's Bill. I'm from North Carolina <laughter>. F Uh, I, <lipsmack> let's see. What kind of books do you like to read? I really have to be in the mood. I, I read one, like maybe once a year. <Laughter> I'm not as, I've never read anything by him. Yeah. Okay. I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and, and that kind of thing. I found that real interesting. I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now. C And that was on T V. It was, F uh, <lipsmack> <static> during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And, F uh, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, F uh, <noise> Morocco. F Uh, this is when they were having their revolution or whatever C and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a, <static> kind of a crazy man, D you know. <Breathing> Surprised me. I had no idea that he was like that. D Well, just like s, some, one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle, C and it should be a grizzly bear because you, D you know, D like the t, t, grizzly and stuff like that. C So it's, I saw the movie C and that's what made me want to read the book. Candice Bergen was in the movie. I'm a real big fan of hers C so, Uhhuh. I like, I like to read some of the philosophy stuff. Yeah, I think that, I'm fascinated by that. Yeah, I'm fascinated by that. That, C and, C and, F uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses. I like, I'm kind of a doubting Thomas C and I like to read stuff like that. Some of it really freaks me out <laughter>. C And I like to read, F uh, <breathing> I like to read some self help books D like, F uh, I read DIANETICS once, once I got past all the gibberish on it. It was okay. It, it, it, it took me a while to really get into it. It, it didn't help me that much <laughter>. C But, F uh, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in your ways. F Uh, then I, one in, real interesting book I read recently was, when I was looking for a job, I read, HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED C and, it, it had real good tips C and it, C and I got the <laughter> job that I wanted by applying the, the methods that, that, All right, C so, we started recording already? F Oh, C so you pressed one? Okay. C So, I guess we're supposed to start talking. F Uh <noise>, what kind of books do you read? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So it's mostly all novels? Okay. F Oh, like what? Yeah, I like that. I like Steinbeck a lot. I have never read a lot of Faulkner. F Oh, cool <noise>. I'm Doug, I'm from Pennsylvania. F Uh, D well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, F uh, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones. C And, D like, I don't really like the, D you know, six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that. Right? Uhhuh. No, like, I like, D say, F uh, Richard Broudigan a lot. F Uh, Okay. He's, F uh, he's dead now, C but he was really a pretty amazing writer. He wrote books that were, D like, pretty short and pretty easy to read, D you know, D like written at a third grade level or whatever. C But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny. D Like, He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA C So that's, D anyway, C and, F uh, I read a lot of non fiction books, too. F Uh, let's see, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Now what's that? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. What, how crazy? <Breathing>. F Oh, sh, <breathing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Cool, D see, I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things. D Like, <Music> Uhhuh. D Like, let's see, C and even like reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in, D like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY. It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that. Uhhuh, <breathing> yep. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh <breathing>. Right, <noise> definitely <<pause>>. F Uh, F Uh, did you like it? Uhhuh.
