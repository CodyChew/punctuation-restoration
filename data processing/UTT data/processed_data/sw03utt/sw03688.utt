Okay, F um, do you have any pets now? <Baby_talking>. <Baby_talking>. Yeah. F Oh, okay. F Um, that, a matter of choice, or compulsion? <Baby_talking>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, right now <breathing> I'm a student, C and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that <laughter>. No, we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat. Yeah. They're very strict about it. F Oh, I love animals. I was raised, <breathing> our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, F uh, at least one cat in the house. It was al, almost always at least one cat, sometimes, D you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, F uh, always cats in the house. Oh. Yeah. How old are your kids? Okay. One. Our first. He's about te, eleven weeks now. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, originally? West Virginia. F Um, I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country C but, Charleston, West Virginia? Okay, that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway? <noise>. Okay, in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania <noise>. Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown. Yeah, yeah. It's, D well, F um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the MasonDixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far. D So, F Oh, it's beautiful. F Uh, D well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly. F Um, D you know, F uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, F uh, type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops. F Um, not a lot of farmland there. Mostly it's, F uh, E I mean, D you know, there's, D you know, individuals with their own, own f, F uh, growing their own food. F Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, F uh, sheep and cattle. C And even that's, D you know, small time mostly. F Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, F uh, industry. It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants. F Uh, aluminum plants. There's like two aluminum plants. Computer engineering. F Uh, just finished up my fourth semester. Yeah. Yeah, it's a big change. I spent, twenty years as a mechanic C so, Yeah. Yeah. I'm working on a bachelor's degree. I'm working on a bachelor's degree. It'll be compu, Pardon? F Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out. That's considered a pretty good program. It's nice and small, which means, D you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four s, D you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get, it again. C But, F uh, i, it's worth it once you get it. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Most the class are pretty small. That works out real well. F Uh, D well, F um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy. I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs. F Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus. F Uh, had a hamster or two, C and they, they got, to be a lot of fun. F Uh, it's amazing how much character, D Well, we don't right now, no. We've, F uh, I grew up with, F uh, with pets. My folks and I always had a dog and a cat, some, birds, C but, F uh, right now we don't have anything. What about you? D Well, we've just, F uh, it seems like, we've always been at a place <baby_talking> where we'd have to go away for the summer or something C and, F uh, it was, never convenient to have anything. we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house. F Uh, someplace where there, D you know, we can take care of it and everything. We've got, some children who would just really, F uh, enjoy having an animal, D you know, a dog, I think C and, What about you all? F Oh, no. <Laughter> Is that right? C But you like, F uh, you like pets and things? <<Faint>> F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. We, we, enjoyed them. We like, we like pets, C but, F uh, D you know, you've got to deal with, F uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that. C And our kids are, we've got some children C and they're not, not used to it, D you know, on a daily basis. They, they, F uh, F Oh, from fourteen down to seven. You sound like you've got some small ones in the background. Is that right? F Oh, great. Congratulations. Where are you from? Uhhuh. Okay. I've been to Charleston. Yes, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. D Well, that's, D yeah, that's interesting. C So it's really up north in the country, really,. I guess so. Gosh. I see. It's pretty nice country up there? Hills, or what? Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Is it farmland? F Oh, yes. Sure. Uhhuh. Okay. What are you, <throat_clearing> what are you studying there at Heidelberg? <<Faint>> F Oh, yeah. What year? D Well, great. Yeah. I hope that works out well. <<Faint>> Yeah. What's, F Oh, did you? D Well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force. Yeah. Are you, F uh, shooting for a bachelor's now, or a master's, or what? F Oh, okay, good. Hope it's a good program there. Hope it's a good program there. Yeah, good. F Huh <<faint>>. D Well, yes, that's good. C And probably a good, F uh, student teacher ratio and things. Yeah <<faint>>. Good. D Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment C or a house somewhere, what would you get? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. A hamster. F Oh, yeah.
