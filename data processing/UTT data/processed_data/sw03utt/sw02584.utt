Okay. Do you go camping very much? F Uh, we try to go once, maybe twice a summer. F Uh, <Laughter> we, F uh, just, D you know, for D like a short weekend or something. We don't go for the long, D you know, week long thing. C But we usually go to, F uh, a lake area, D you know, where the campsites, are and do that. F Uh, F Oh no, no, no a tent. Me too <laughter>. You're really roughing it. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Are you here in local Texas, E I mean? I'm in Garland. Right outside of Dallas. C So we, F um, we have a five year old, C and we started taking her, she was pretty young when we started, F uh, camping with her. I know. I know, C and then they, C and they, D you know, <sigh> there's no T V, C and they don't have all these modern toys, C and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like, that to play with. C And I like that. It's pretty fun. Uhhuh. Yeah. We, we try to, F uh, go with another couple that have children also. C And, F uh, that makes it a lot more enjoyable. C Plus, D you know, we don't have to go out and buy all the <sigh> equipment and stuff, D you know, we kind of split it up. F Uh, Yeah <laughter>. Because it gets, it really does get expensive if you, if you don't want to rough it all the way. D You know, even the sleeping bags, those are running, D you know, a good thirty dollars a pop, C and, C and so we've built that up. C But, No. Want one bad. Do you? Oh. Yes <laughter>. Yeah, I would too. Would too. We usually, F uh, let's see, we try to go to a lake. My husband and this, F uh, other couple that we go with, her husband, F um, kind of likes, F um, is it scuba dive? C And, so we'll go to a lake and, F uh, <throat_clearing> where they can go do that. We're close enough so they can do that, C and the girls can play on the beach area <whispering>. <<Okay. Whispers this, maybe to someone in background.>> Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. That's fun. <Laughter> Really? Am I pretty Texan? <Laughter>. No, you don't, you don't sound like it to me. F Oh, have you? <Laughter> Yeah. Yes. F Oh, that's true, that's true. I, D see I don't think I do, C but, F uh, C but a lot of people do say I sound like, I guess, I have, I guess more of a twang, to my voice <<faintly, almost a whisper>>. I sure am. I've lived here all my life. C But, any way, F uh, <<almost whispering>>, Yes, yes we went last summer, actually. C Or is there? Okay, D well, we didn't go camping, we just, F uh, we did D like, F uh, we drove down to Houston to visit friends, C and, we went to Galveston and, F uh, to San Antonio and then up to Austin. And, and kind of, F uh, D you know, doing the sight seeing type stuff. C So we didn't go camping. That would be fun though to go. That's one thing my husband wanted to do, was, on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went. C And I said, D Well, I'd love that C but, It does, C and, C and ever once, D you know, on my summer vacation, D you know, my weeklong vacation, I, want to be a little bit pampered, D you know, by a, hotel and a waiter <laughter>. C So, we're hoping to do D like a three day weekend. There's, F um, a thing called Pfeiffer Rim. I don't know if you have ever heard of it? It's, F uh, there's a town called Glenrose. I think it's around two hours from here. C And, F uh, it's, it has D like dinosaur tracks, and stuff like that C and it's got one of those wildlife parks. Yeah. I think that'll be fun. C So we're going to try to do that D like on a three day weekend, go there C and, No, I haven't. Where at? Is it? I've just been up there skiing, C and, D well, we've driven through, C and, D you know, C but, C but not, D you know, camping or anything. C But I would love to camp, in the mountains. That's what my girlfriend says. Yes, she loves that place. She loves that. She says that where we need to go sometime. Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. I love that. That's neat. That's neat. I used to go camping all the time as a, a Girl Scout. <Laughter> All the time. I got real used to it then. I felt like we roughed it then <laughter>. Right. Yes. <Laughter> Exactly. E I mean, we had to make the fires and dig latrines <laughter> and everything. <Laughter> You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff, to really be camping <laughter>. Yeah. D Well do you, you, you say you haven't been in years? F Oh, gosh, bless your heart. <Laughter>. Yes. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all. Years ago it would have been fine C but, Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. I kn, I can imagine. <Laughter>. No <laughter>. I don't blame you, not nowadays. Yeah. Now are you with T I down there? Good. Have you? <laughter>. Okay. Oh. F Oh, that's neat. F Um. It's hard isn't it? D Now, how old are your girls? F Oh, goodness. No, you're not old <laughter>. <Child_talking> <<saying, Who is it?>> You're not old at all. Sure. F Oh, okay. Do you need to go? Yeah. That's very smart. Yeah, me too. C And good luck. How many have you made so far, calls? F Oh, have you? They're all, this is only about my second one I've ever made. I've been a recipient on the others. How many have you had so far, do you know? Four, that's good. Very good. Yes. Yeah. I don't, yeah, you bet, you bet. I know. Yes, I always try to find out where they're from, D you know, C cause, C because it is neat. It really is. D Well then, I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door C and, You, me too. Thanks. Okay. Thank you. Byebye. No, I've haven't gone camping in years. C But it's is something that I've done in the past. How about you? That's, that's pretty average to me <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Do you tent camp C or do you have a camper? That's what I ha, D you know, that's how I camp too. That's how I define camping <laughter>. <Laughter> The rest, the rest of that is re, really not the same. As a matter of fact, my, my, D you know, the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it. F Um, as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother, C and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota. C So, that's, that's really wild. Yes, I'm in Austin, where are you? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, the kids love it. E I mean, they just love it. It's wonderful for them to be outside. Exactly. Yes. D Well, how it, it's really is a, is a good, good family thing, to do. Yeah. C And, Uhhuh. Good planning <laughter>. Exactly. You're right. Do you have a boat? No? F Oh, D well, D actually, I would, D you know what I would love? I would absolutely love a sail boat. That doesn't go along with camping, C but, now that, that, that's what I would like, to have. Yeah. Uhhuh. C And I would play on the beach area too. That's what I would do. <Laughter> Yeah. I'm just sitting here list, listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that. You're pretty Texan. Yes. C But D you know, you know what's really funny? F Um, I've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent, C and, C and E I mean, there is just no way I've not picked one up. I've only lived here about six years. C So, i, i, if I have one, it must be very, very slight. <Laughter> The Yankees can hear it. Uhhuh. Are you a, a native Texan? Oh. D Well, good for you. Have you ever been to Austin? This, how was, I'm wondering, I'm really not that not familiar. I know there are some good places to go camping along the, F uh, the lakes. Uhhuh. It takes a lot more planning. Uhhuh. Right. Exactly, exactly, yeah. No, I haven't. F Oh, that sounds, That sounds great. Have you ever camped out of state? D You know, where you should try, sometime is Colorado. It is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. Estes State Park is fantastic. D See, you need to go there. It is. It's, D you know, it's, it's high canyon C and, F uh, C and there's this little mountain lakes C and it's very peaceful. C And, F um, in, in the early fall time, F um, I can't remember what type of trees they are, C but they, all the leaves turn yellow, C and it's just brilliant. C And, Yes, you would. You'd like it very much. I know you would. I was too <laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, D well we did, D you know, we really did. E I mean, I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V, and parking it and sitting inside and watching T V, and having your microwave <laughter>, It's not camping. Right, right. E I mean that is it <laughter>. Right. <Laughter> Oh. No, I haven't. I'm, F um, I'm a struggling single mom. C and, F uh, <laughter> thank you. F Um, it's, D you know, time is precious, money's precious. F Um, C and i, i, it, it, I think I haven't been able to do it, C and, D you know, what, that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children, D you know, again. C And th, I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women. D You know? I hope, Yes, I, I really now, n, n, I, I have gone on one little vacation, just the girls and I. We drove down to Port Aransas, and rented a little efficiency, D you know, and, and had a marvelous like two nights, C and that was great. C And even at that, it, it was like the first time that I ventured, D you know, out of the city by myself. C And, C and, D you know, I, I stayed in a nice place. C But it's still, it's real different not to have another adult with you. D You know. I'm just a chicken. I know lots of women would do it all the <laughter> time. I haven't quite adjusted, D you know? D Well, I, I was with T I until January. I, F uh, I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money. C So, D well it's, It was a good plan but I haven't yet <laughter>. I got into sales, C and, I'm selling, F uh, telephone systems. C And it's, it's fun C and it's interesting, C but it's also, F um, pretty challenging, C and I haven't, I haven't started making money yet. C So, yeah, it's, it's hard <child>. Eleven and fourteen. Yeah. C So I'm old <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, excuse me just second. <<B speaks to someone>> Honey, I'll be wi, yeah, go ahead. <<Background voice, Okay.>> There's someone at the door. D Well, F um, I'm going to listen. We always check and see if we should answer the door, at night. Yeah C so, D well, I've enjoyed this. C And, F uh, I, I haven't made any. I've been just a recipient <laughter>. I think I've had about four. Ye, yeah. That's four each. D Well, D you know, when I had to sup, this is my, my Gemini nature, D you know, it's like what are you interested in, C and it's like virtually anything. I'll talk about anything to anybody <laughter>. C And it's, it's been real interesting, the different personalities <laughter>. That I run across. Exactly. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, thank you. C And, F um, I enjoyed talking with you. You have a good time camping, when you go next time, think of me <child>. All right. Byebye.
