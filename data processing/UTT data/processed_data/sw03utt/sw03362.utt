Okay, I'll let you start this time. D Well, F uh, even though it's totally out of my, F uh, my degree training, I've been working as, as, in the horticultural aspect, D so the last, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, D so F Uh, I'm, D Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper. <Laughter> No, mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of, C but, F uh, I don't know, I, I guess, F uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, F uh. I have a, F uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything. <Laughter> Okay. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's terrible. Twentythree de, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant. I think the Saint Augustine and, F uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah, those two. Yeah. F Um. Yeah. D Well, I know my folks live, F uh, in Arizona there, C and, F uh, D you know, they just grow rocks C and. That's their gardening there. D So, F uh, I guess as long as you can have, F uh, some grass there. C So. I know I was in, F uh, Houston when I was working for a company once, C and we were taking care of lawns out there, C and, F uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, D you know, it was raining continuously. C And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems. Uhhuh. Are, are you, F uh, able to get, F uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden? <Laughter> D Well, how much do you like lawn and garden work? Oh. F Oh, for goodness sakes. What do you do? Uhhuh, D well, that's interesting. F Um, C so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. D Well <throat_clearing>, I love to work outside, really, C and I enjoy flowers and stuff. I don't do a whole lot of it, F um, at this exact point in my life, F um, because I have two teenage boys, C and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care <laughter>, C but I still take care of the, D you know, flower beds and things like that. I was even planning to go out and to, F uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, D you know, were planted in the ground since last spring C and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me, C and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, F oh, twentythree degrees or something C so the hibi, hibiscus plants no longer exist <laughter>. C And I really feel bad about it, it's a plant that we've had for probably twentyfive years that these were cuttings off of, D you know. C So, they're all gone at this point. Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though. I grew up in Illinois C and, F um, <throat_clearing> Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry, why, D you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land, F uh, <lipsmack> watering system. C And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, F um, D you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water. C But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass C and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack C and <cough>, C and I just think it's ugly <laughter>. When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, D you know, and their grass is fairly green. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter, C but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer. They have to water an incredible amount. C But, F um, those law, those lawns look nice during the winter, C but, D you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb. C But, D you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, D you know, it's sort of like, D well, <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Yes, that's true. Yeah, Houston is a lot, F um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area, that's where Plano is, C and, F um, <lipsmack> C and just humidity D you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid. Yes, uhhuh, I think people do. Yeah. I don't have a vegetable garden, haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually, C but, F um, C but, yes, uhhuh, we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,
