D Well I grew up out in the country and, F uh, was used to having, F uh, guns around the place C and, F uh, I'm, F uh, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, F uh, word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well I, I feel that its, F uh, I think the what was National Rifle Association, F uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, F uh, about if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns then. C And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a gu, a gun, a knife, a, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with, C and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, F uh, we can handle it C but there's an element that can't. They have got them outgunned. There was a an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, F uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower. It had, held D like a fifteen shot clip, which, F uh, would be able, th, they would be able to put down anything that came at them, C but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, F uh, a thirtyeight, F uh, Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good. Yeah. I have lived in, F uh, Illinois at one time C and they, they passed a, F uh, it wasn't really gun control C but it was, you had to register as a gun owner, you didn't have to list your guns, C but you had to have this card, it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition C and that was the first, F uh, this was twenty years ago. C But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect. Pardon? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. We lived in Tennessee for awhile C and I bought a pistol there C and there was a fifteen day waiting period. You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted C and, then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing. No, I think that, F uh, D you know, a, a waiting period, F uh, can make a difference C but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that. C So there's, I don't, think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because, Right, right. Yeah, I'm, <Laughter> We, we're getting into capital punishment now <laughter>. C But I, I agree with you there that, F uh, Yeah. The, F uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be. It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one. C And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands C but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element. F Oh yes. Yeah. <Talking> You don't have to carry one in your car or your, F uh, <Laughter> or your pocket all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well I know what, F uh, I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun. My wife the same thing, F uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have no, not that I have an arsenal or anything, C but we have several guns around the house <breathing> one of these days my grandkids probably. C But I think it's, F uh, you got to have, have the pl, living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot C but, F uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, F uh, they get back up. If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, F uh, showed me. This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle, this was a gentleman in his sixties, C and he took me out with him and, F uh, single shot twentytwo, and taught me how to shoot. We went squirrel hunting C and, C and, F uh, he taught me how to shoot, F uh, a old single shot twentytwo C and, I was probably about twelve at the time, C and I thought that was the neatest thing C and, of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him C and he let me shoot and showed me how. Right. F Oh, <laughter> yeah. <sniffing> D Well that's about all I, we agreed pretty well on this I think. Okay. D Well it's been real nice talking with you. Okay, bye. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself. D You know, I have quite a collection myself C and, D you know, I'm a good hunter C and I started hunting when I was twelve years old. <talking> Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes C and, D you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely C but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either C so, I believe that. <Talking>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah C and it's, D you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons C because everybody that's in drug trafet, trafficking has got them. D You know. Yeah. C So. F Um. Yeah <sniffing>. Yeah, that would be, Yeah, that's, No it's sure not. Huhuh. Yeah. F Um. Yeah. D See in California they, In California they make you register when you buy ammunition. You have to sign a, D you know, they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff, before you can buy any big ammunition. <Talking> Especially for handguns, D now rifles aren't too bad, C but, D you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it, or sign up for it, C so. Uhhuh. Gee. D Gee, that's not a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah, yeah it is. No. Th, the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun. D You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course, i, I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway, I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot. D So. Yeah, <laughter> C but, D you know. It would definitely be gun control <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Myself. Yeah. D Well C and the, they're actually a necessity in life, D you know. They're not, D you know, not everybody needs a gun C but sooner or later I need one. D You know, whether I'm out hunting or D you know, I'm never had to protect my life or, D well I did in the service but not, D you know, not on the street C so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects, No, huhuh. No. C So mine are, D you know, I use mine for recreation, I don't, C and I enjoyed my guns. I have a good time with them C so, Yeah. Probably. Yeah. No, huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I had to explain that to my, I've got a six year old now C and he, D you know, I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, D well they understand now. D You know I've taken time to teach them C and D now the young boy wants to know C and, D you know, D like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, D you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, D you know, C so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows C and I took it away from him, I said now, D you know, C so he's learning the hard way C but at least it was a B B gun not a twentytwo or a four ten or something C so, F Um. Uhhuh. All right. Uhhuh. Yeah. All right. I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one. D You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away, C so. Yeah, I think so. All right, have a good one. Byebye <talking>.
