Okay. F Uh, do you live in a home? Uhhuh. F Oh, did you? Uhhuh. We've lived in ours for about six years. We had it built, actually. C And, F uh, F uh, it's our first home, too. Yeah. F Um, D well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in, C and, F um, that was quite an experience <laughter>. I, I much prefer having my own home and, and, F uh, just the space and, and more privacy. Yeah. F Um, it's, F uh, F uh, it's D like twentyfour fifty square feet. It's a two story. Yeah. How about yours? Is it small? F Oh, really. F Oh, uhhuh. Do you, do you have children? Just one. F Oh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh yeah, yeah. D Well, D like, F um, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh. Yeah, it, it, it, it does, it, it seems about, F oh, probably average. F Um. C But our neighborhood has a, just a wide variety of, of, F um, people, C and, D you know, there's older people here, and, and, F um, people that are our, our age, we're in our thirties. C And, F um, there's a lot of kids, a lot of kids. People across the street have eight. Uhhuh. Yeah, their home just burned down matter of fact, and, F um, last summer, C and they're just rebuilding C and, F um, their house is going to be really big <laughter>. It's. Yeah, they're building a lot bigger. He's, F uh, F um, F uh, F oh, not an obstetrician, an, an orthopedic surgeon. C And, F um, C so since the house did burn, they're, they're going, it's quite different than it was before, C and it's it's a lot bigger. C And, F um, C but ours is about, it's, D you know, it's a nice home, it's definitely not one of the, the smaller ones, C and, F um, it's not the biggest either. C But. F Oh. Yeah. Yeah. You. D You know, that's interesting you say that, because we do have, we have those architectural codes here C and when we, F um, put out house in, F um, they wanted us to have, there was one, we have part siding on, on the two story part and then on the back, C and, they, there was one side where our chimney was, C and just the chimney was going to be brick, C and they wanted us to have more brick, C so we ended up having to go halfway up which, it does look nicer, C and, D you know, we would have like to have had all brick, C but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it, C and, C but, it's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all. C So it's kind of like, they were. Yeah, yeah, C and, I, C and so it was kind of like it's they, ours is the last street that they built on. C So the houses actually on our street are a little bit, they're kind of gone a little bit nicer. Yeah, E I mean, just they, D you know, it's D like the second phase C and, C and so they've kind of changed the, the codes a little bit, C and so that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any. F Oh, uhhuh. Yes. We, we, it's a house we bought, F uh, about two and a half years ago now. Uhhuh. First house. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So what do you think of, of owning a home as opposed to, to renting somebody else's? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Do you have, is it a fairly large house? F Oh, that's pretty good size. Yeah. Uhhuh. It's tiny. It's not much bigger. D Actually we had an apartment, two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is. C So. Yeah, it's, F uh, it's only D like eleven hundred square feet. Just one. Yeah. C But, it, it, F uh, all the rooms are small, E I mean, C but it ends up giving us three bedrooms, which we wanted. And, F uh. Use an extra one for an office which is handy. I'd rather have, have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lot, lots of space, C but, F uh, that ends up costing me. <Laughter>. D Well, they're, it's pretty typical, E I mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood. F Uh, lots of, lots of young couples with, D you know, usu, F oh, I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes and, F uh, lots of kids and stuff, C and, so it, it fits well, in the neighborhood. It's, it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood, C but on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want. Is, is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood C or is it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, D wow, eight kids? F Oh, my gosh. Ooh. I'm sure, with eight, gosh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, new ones, E I mean, they, they tend to, to be real tiny, but that F uh, especially in newer neighborhoods, my, my brother just built a new house. He lives in Wichita, Kansas, C and the, F um, the neighborhood actually fought him on it, C because he, he was, F um, the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood. D Now, that's because he was, he's doing a lot of it himself and, D you know, for example, landscaping and, and lots of the other stuff, C and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots <laughter> in the neighborhood, C but C but they were, they were pretty touchy on it. He was a little surprised. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Kind of depends on when they get in, D you know. F Oh, they have, it's gotten, yeah. Yeah, oh. Uhhuh. F Um. D Well, D see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they, they moved into a neighborhood and bought a, a real nice stone house down in South Austin. C And, F uh, C and, the, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they, they do phase one, C and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled, F uh, codes and, and, and stuff, C and then they come back in, C and, C and then they sell,
