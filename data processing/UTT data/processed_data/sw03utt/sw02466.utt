Okay. Your name is Lynn? Linda. Yeah, I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to. Uhhuh. F Um, D well <static> F um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade, C so most of my books are, F um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books. Uhhuh. What kind of things have you read? Uhhuh. F Uh, I haven't gotten through <laughter> it yet. No. F Um, as far as dealing with divorce? Good self help. D Well, F um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee C and it's one that we use in our work. It's probably one you'd find in D like a Christian book store. I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that. F Um, probably should stay on the topic, C but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read <throat_clearing>. I'm a therapist for Rossa. It's a Christian treatment organization C and because of that I D see, F uh, work with adolescents specifically, C so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems. Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse, C so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues. Uhhuh. D Well, sometimes it's rewarding, C and, C and sometimes it's a struggle. F Um, <laughter> I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, F uh, reading, D yeah, reading just for enjoyment. In fact, Uhhuh. F Um, that's neat. Yeah, I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college F um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much, C but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading. Uhhuh. Yeah, I've got a stack next to my bed <laughter>. I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book C and then I, I get distracted, and, or have to start on another one, <throat_clearing> it's pretty tough to keep up with. I was trying to think of, I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED C but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read. Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of. Uhhuh. F Uh. That's interesting. Uhhuh. Is it? ? F Um. Uhhuh <<pause>>. F Um, not very long. I really just started. My wife has been working for T I. F Oh, uhhuh. It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with. <laughter> C So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read, C and, I don't know when I'm going to get to them all. I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah, a little bit. F Um. Trying to think. Uhhuh. I like that kind of stuff. I think the last novel I read I read, I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year. It was a, F um, last name's, it's called PIERCING, E no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS. It's, F uh, kind of unusual book. It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. D Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly. Yeah, nice talking to you, Linda. Okay, great. Hope you like you it. Uhhuh. You, too. Byebye. Okay, that made a nice ugly sound. C So, Linda. Uhhuh. D So, sounds like you like to read. I don't read as much as I would like to either. I'm, I'm a single mom, C but I have always loved reading. What do you like to read? That what I've been reading lately a lot of. F Um, my interests switch around dramatically. I used to read just, mainly fic, fiction, C and now I, lik, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books. F Oh, I read all kinds of things for, F um, helping people survive a divorce. F Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites. Have you read that? You haven't? Okay, what would you recommend? F Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book. Yeah. F Um, that sounds good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'm writing it down. That does soun, that's sound really good. F Um, what kind of counseling do you do, C or should we stay on the topic of books? . Oh. F Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway, C and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible, as a teen. That's, F uh, that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that. F Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. F Uh, what oth, is, is that just the only type of reading you've been doing, C or do you, have you read any good novels lately? just joy reading. Yeah. I hear you there, that's for sure. F Um, I guess, the last book I've read, my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class, C And I just realized I had never read it growing up. C So, I just finished reading that <laughter> for enjoyment. C And it wa, it was good. F Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much, C so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her. C But I thought it was real interesting. Uhhuh. I know. Yeah. F Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books, C but, I, I keep lists, I must have a list of, F oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I want to read. Just like, I want to read that and I write it down. So do I. F Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE. Yeah. I, I bought that one, C and I didn't get into, involved in that one as well. There's another one he wrote that even sounds better, C and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace, D you know, D like, and communities building communities. Someone just recently said something really neat about that. F Uh, I got involved in, F uh, Beginning Experience Weekends, C and, F uh, it was of the people from there that said that. His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent, C and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects. C And he did, F uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the, D you know, one of the places. C So, I've ha, F um, Yeah, it, it really was. A real fun boo, bunch of books that I read, F uh, the beginning of last year were, F um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEA, SEAGULL I can't think of his name. Pardon me F uh, no, F uh, <<pause>> F oh, it'll, it'll come to me, C but he wrote, he wrote the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER TI, A BRIDGE TO FOREVER. Those are mind expanding books <laughter>. His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of. <<pause>> I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though. C But, F uh, they, they were fun. They were real just books for fun. Have you been involved on the Switchboard long? Uhhuh. How did you get involved? F Oh, I see. I'm a former T Ier. I just recently quit. C And so, F uh, I got myself involved in a sales job, C and right now, my list of books to be read have to do with, F uh, the art of selling. D So. Uhhuh. Never, never there's never going to be enough hours in the day. Even if you took speed reading. F Huh. C So, <<pause>> D well, I'm trying to think of what other kind. Do you like to read mysteries. Do you like Ken? He writes, F uh, spy novels, <<pause>> THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE C and, F uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable <<pause>>. F Um. F Oh that sounds interesting. <Noise> <<sounds like phone knocking against something>> It sounds really good. Hey, you should make yourself a promise that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you. D You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, D you know, self improvement, C and you kind of forget the fun of reading <<pause>>. Yeah, very easily. C So <<pause>>, I think so, too. C And I thank you for calling. C And, F uh, I'll have to check out that book you, told me about. Okay, Thank you. You take care. Byebye.
