Okay <laughter>, what, do you do artistic painting? F Oh, you do? Do you do a lot of it? I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago C and I've done a little, F uh, C But it takes a lot of time <laughter>. D, do you sell your projects? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Where do you work at? D Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique? Uhhuh. <Laughter> That keeps you busy. Uhhuh. Have you tried any of the, D well, do you cut out your own projects? F Huh. Do you, F uh, ever spray your projects with the, E I mean a base coat first C or do you brush it on? Uhhuh. I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, F uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns. C And I do a lot of woodworking C and that's what I bought it for. C But I haven't used it yet. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, fine furniture. Yeah. That's why I brought, bought the sprayer is to finish my projects. That's my worst, <inhaling> worst part of my woodworking. I get so sick of making <laughter>, Yeah, C but spraying does put on a nicer finish. For woodworking? F Uh, let me see, table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers, C and ts about it. Yeah, it is. <Laughter> Yeah, the band saw is really nice. I have an Inca. I don't know if you've ever heard of those. C But it's nice to have the right equipment. Uhhuh. F Uh not, mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts. C But, Making my own furniture. F Uh, just in junior high C and then I just kept on through high school and then <inhaling> got my own equipment, kept up with that. Yeah. Yeah. D Like the shelves and, For your <Throat_clearing> tole painting. <Laughter>. Good. D Well <breathing>, I guess I'll let you go now. F Oh, they do? Okay, C so this is my first one.

F Uh, I've done, F uh, perpetual calendars and <inhaling> cookie jar lids and, F oh, on and on, D you know, just things like that, C but F uh, I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job <laughter>. I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden C so, No, <breathing> I've wanted to do that, F uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that. D So, I have five children of my own, C so it's they, they keep me busy C and tole painting is just a, D you know, something I do in my spare time C so <laughter>, Yes, uhhuh, I have my own saws C and so I really enjoy doing that. I brush it on, yeah, I haven't tried a, a spray varnish. I use just a wood sealer. Yeah. F Oh, uhhuh. Do you? Oh. F Oh, D well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it? Oh. D Now what type of woodworking do you do? F Oh do you? Oh. F Oh, <laughter> C but it's hard to finish it, F huh. F Oh, D well, that is interesting. D So, what kind of equipment do you have? Uhhuh.
