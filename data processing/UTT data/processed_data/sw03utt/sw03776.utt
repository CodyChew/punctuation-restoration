I, F uh, spent four years as a university professor. C And, Yeah. F Oh, do you really? That's great. No kidding. W, I did. I did, F uh, D Well, I was pretty young. I was, F uh, I had never intended to do it C and I was, F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in, in, F uh, F uh, one of the business schools in the California State University system. <Inhaling> At any rate, F uh, the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is, F uh, research the problem from the point of view of, F uh, F uh, what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically. You may be familiar with cooperative learning. Have you ever, D Well, the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools. C And, F uh, what, what it involves, basically, <lipsmack> is the use of peer groups C and the, F uh, teacher becomes a, F uh, a sort of a consultant, resource person to the cooperative learning, F uh, to the learning cooperatives, I guess they're called. C And there are, F uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, F uh, gain a competence with respect to the material. F Uh, I think that the combination of, F uh, technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn. F Uh, I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system, F uh, that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster. F Uh, school systems are, in too many states, dominated by administrators C and, F uh, both teachers and parents, F uh, complain about the, F uh, F uh, the cost and ineffectiveness that results. D So my feeling is that, F uh, <lipsmack> the, the problem is, is, F uh, significant. There are plenty of good people, F uh, available to, F uh, offer people educational experience, C but that we just have to re, reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it C and, F uh, I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research, F uh, F uh, of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance, particularly, F uh, accelerate the, the pace of learning. C And, my feeling is that, F uh, those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually. I don't know what form it will ultimately take. F Uh, F uh, C but, I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for, F uh, inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior, C so it must be the way we're managing the process that, F uh, I, I don't, I don't think it's, it's a matter of, of, F uh, talented people to do it, a, both as, quote, unquote students and as teachers, C but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent, F uh, you must see kids with real significant problems, F uh, in some cases. F Uh, course, I always see the, I don't know how hard, how hard is it, F uh, in the public school system in Iowa City? Is it, is it, F uh, deteriorated a lot. Do the people say, are they pretty happy with it, C or, Right. Even in Utah. D Well, Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe. Yeah, you, C so, you saw a fair number of troubled kids. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh really? I, I spent three years, I'm teaching in public schools and elementary school. Uhhuh. I taught in Utah, C and, F uh, Did you teach in California? Uhhuh. You sound pretty young for a university professor <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well you can, you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in Utah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I see what year saying, yeah, I totally agree. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, I, I haven't taught in Iowa, C but I've taught in Utah, C and, F uh, people there were saying that the way that the schools were going, a lot of people were going away and going to private schools, or else going to home, where they taught their kids at home. Or, D you know, anything but the public schools and the ones that did have, D you know, the kids, Yeah D well, D Well, F uh, maybe it was the area I was in, C but a lot of schools had a lot of transient, F uh, families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side C and, Yeah, E I mean, like you said, how they were, the schools are doing more things for the kids, they thought, than they were thirty years ago. E I mean, they were, the school I was teaching at, the, the year I left, they were considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids. As well as hot lunch C and,
