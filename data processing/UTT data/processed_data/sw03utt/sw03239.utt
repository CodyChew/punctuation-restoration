D Well, do you have any pets? Oh. F Oh, I used to have box turtles, F um, D well, years ago, when I was growing up I, I really like them. Oh. <Laughter>. Yes, F um, we have one dog, a Bichon Frise. F Um, our friends in Houston bred the dogs. I had never heard of them they're, F um, they're all white C and they're small, and, F um, and fluffy, they don't shed. I guess they're distantly related to a poodle, C but they're not very well known in this country, C and they're not, F um, high strung or over bred F um. Ours is, F uh, on the small end, C and she's about ten pounds, C and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds C and they love people, F um, and kids C and that was something we were looking for, F um, our, our love is Golden Retrievers, C and that's what we had intended to get in Houston, C but we had a small yard and a pool C and knowing how they love to dig and love the water, F um, and we thought that was kind of a tough climate C so, F uh, we ended up getting this, C and, F uh, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think <laughter> now he wants a, a good size dog <laughter>. Oh. Yeah. D Well, they really are, F um, they're really sweet dogs. We've, F uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, F um, the family that had them and, and bred them. They had five litters of puppies, C and C and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood C because, F um, It's B I C H O N F R I S E. Bichon Frise. Yeah. They're, F uh, C and they don't shed C so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with allergies, C and they love people, C and they're, F Um, no, not really. Ours, F um, ours barks more than, F um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends house. We used to swap back and forth dogs. they have three dogs. They had a Cockapoo, and, and two Bichons F um, C and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there C and, F uh, now it's funny. She's, she's a good watch dog C and if there's, she'll bark that way, C but she also talks a lot, she F um, has a definite personality C and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because she doesn't want to be left. F Um. No, no, C and they're, F um, they're very smart dogs. The circuses in Europe used to use them F um, for the acts. They, F uh, F oh, they'll dance on their hind legs each F um, C but they're very easy to train C and, D Well, they range, I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper. They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think which I thought was a lot. D Well, she's no longer breeding them C but, F um, C because her dogs, F um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter, C and, F uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem C and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, F um, pets, D you know they weren't, weren't show quality. Ri, F Oh, C but, D yeah, takes a lot of time. Yeah, F um, C but she might have some contacts here, I know origina, I know that the dog's grandmother, F um, was from Plano, F Oh, that's where I live, too. Yes I do. I have a dog named Grisly, who's a ten year old, F uh, mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow. C And I have a pair of box turtles. <Laughter>. Yeah, F Oh, yeah, I do, too. Lucky and Spot, that's their names C and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room, C and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle, and always has his nose all around my turtle box, C so do you have any pets now? No, I haven't either. Oh. C And how big do they get. F Oh, that's interesting. Ye, the water, yes. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh, D well, we've got a good size dog, C and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature Dachshund, C and I miss having a little one D you know, around. The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. Oh. Uhhuh. C And how do you spell that breed? F R I S E. C And how do you pronounce that? Okay. I'm writing it out phonetically, Yes, Do they bark a lot? Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Yes. Oh. Does she ever mess in the house? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, gee. Uhhuh. C And about how much are they? C And how about the, C And how about the person in, F uh, Houston? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Just pets, Yes, that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl. We did that every weekend, Yes, C and it's very expensive. F Oh, that's where I live, Yeah, I'm at Coit and Legacy...
