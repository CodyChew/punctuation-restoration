Okay. You can go first, C or I will. Okay. D Well, I'm going to tell you what I'd have <laughter>. Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp, okay? C And I have, F uh, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that I cook. C And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea, C and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert. Yes. C And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, F uh, D like your rice steamer, your rice cooker. C And, F um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer, C and you put a bay leaf and put some, F uh, red pepper over it. Now, you can C either use, D you know, the kind that comes in the little can C or you can just get some, D you know, regular red peppers. Cayenne? Uhhuh. C And you put a little bit of that over it. Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them. C And you put that in there, C and then you pour two bottles of beer over it. Two pounds. That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells. Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up. C And you pour the beer over the top of it, C and you cover it. C And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil, and the shrimp turn pink. Then you remove it, C and you put it on a platter. C And then you serve it with melted butter. C And, F uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine. C And they can just dip it, C and they shell it as they eat it. C But, F uh, then the mi, F uh, the cauliflower, you, cook that in the microwave. C And what you do is, you just, F uh, wash it, C and you core it. And in a D like a, F oh, A what do you call it? D Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave. Uhhuh. C But it's got to have one that has a cover on it. C And you, F uh, put about two tablespoons of, F uh, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt. C And then you just set your cauliflower in there, C and then you cook it for seven minutes on high. C And you rotate it one time. Uhhuh. Y, F Uh, when you core it, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off. C And, F uh, you just set it in there, C and you microwave it on high for seven minutes, C and you turn it one time. C And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder, C and I mix it all together. C And I shred up some just regular white cheese. C And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it, C and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that. C And you cook it for another three minutes on high, D you know, just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it. C And, it's done. It is good. C But it, it looks, E I mean, what you can do then, see is, D like what I usually do is, I'll D like sit the cauliflower in the middle, C and then I put the, F uh, shrimp around the outside of it, D you know, on my platter. C And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that. C And, D you know, you have all the different seasonings and stuff, C and then I just fix little individual cups for them. C And they have the, garlic bread, C and it makes it a real nice looking, D you know. Huhuh, huhuh. C But it looks like it, D you know <laughter>. You look like you went to a whole bunch, Right. C And, F uh, usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up, and put some color into it, D you know, C and I'll lay those on top of my salad, D you know, to make it look nice and things like that. Okay. F Uh, it usually serves six. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever had crawfish? F Oh. You ought to try some crawfish. They are good. C But D see, that's one good thing about living down here is, usually anybody that comes over, D you know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking. D You know, they want it from down here. C Because, just like now, especially crawfish, it is starting to move out, D you know, C and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is. C But, F Uh, it's similar. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's not exactly. E I mean, it's got a taste of its own, D you know, C but it is, it is similar to, because you only eat the, tails of it. F Um, it looks more like a crab. Uhhuh. C But, No. F Um, let me think of, <sigh> I can't even think of what you, I guess if, it, F uh, it looks like, more like a cross between, F uh, a crab and, F uh, and a lobster. C Because it's small like that C and it's got the pinchers like a crab. C But, D you know, it's, it's similar to a lobster too, because the tail has got the little pleats in it, like a, lobster would. C And we call them mud bugs <laughter>. C But, E I mean, they're fantastic tasting. They are so good. Everybody, it's, it's the season for them right now. Louisiana. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yes. D You know, You buy it, you buy it as a seasoning. Huhuh. Huhuh. I cook mine, D well, do you have a, F uh, D like a black iron skillet? F Oh, okay. D Well, I guess you could cook it in, in that too, C but I don't know. D You know, I never have. I use, F uh, F uh, the black iron skillet to cook mine. Uhhuh. C But it really, it's not, it, it, it doesn't burn or anything like that. The blackening is really the seasoning. E I mean, there is, it's, it's, a blackening seasoning. D You know, E I mean, that is a seasoning. That's really, it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time, or something like that, to get it, C Because, it's called, F uh, what it's called is, Blackening Magic. C And it, it comes in a bottle, C and, F uh, D Well, I'm trying to see. It's got a, a picture of Dom De Luise on it. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah. C But you do have to have it, D you know, you do have to have it hot when you cook it. E I mean, your pan. It does have to be really hot, D you know, when you put it in. C But it's not like it's burned, C and it, what it, what blackens it, is the seasoning. C And it is so good. Oh! <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana, D you know, to visit? Yeah. You ought, to come down. F Um, you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans, D you know, if you want to really get some good food. E I mean, you don't have to go that far south. C But, F uh, of course, the further south you go, the better the food is, as far as I'm concerned. C And fact is, we're going to take a vacation this year. We're going to go to New Orleans, again. C And, F uh, we're only going down there for the food, though <laughter>. F Uh, yeah. We go to the, the French Quarters and stuff like that. C And, F uh, I have some friends that live down there. C And so, usually we go to, we don't go to the tourist ones. We go to the ones that they tell us to go to, D you know. C And we went to this one, it was called The Back Porch. C And, F uh, they were cooking the stuff, D you know, while we were, we went on this boat ride. C And then we came back and ate, out on this, it was like a back porch <laughter>. C And, F uh, usually if you can find somebody, <ringing> <<telephone in background>> Of course now, when you go down there, D you know, E I mean, they've got just, there's no where you can miss. I have never gone to a restaurant, and not just been so full, it's unreal. E I mean, it's so good. The seasoning they, it's just unreal. Gumbo. No, gumbo. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. You can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And I'll tell you what. Do you want to go first? D Well, you go ahead. <Laughter>. Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, it sounds fantastic. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is it cayenne pepper, you mean? Yes. Uhhuh. Yes. C And how much shrimp would you use? Two pounds, okay. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. A glass dish. Uhhuh. Okay, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. C And it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time? Okay. I see. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, that sounds fantastic. <Laughter>. F Um, F um. Uhhuh. Sure. C And it's not much work. That sounds, <Laughter> Yeah, real, I bet it tastes good too. F Oh, yeah. D Now, how many could you serve? Yeah. O, okay. I figured about that. F Oh, that's good. See out here, we have so many, F uh, ethnic people. We have Italians, C and we have Portuguese, C and we have Russians and Polish. C And it depends, out here, D like the type of people you're going to entertain, D you know? C So it's hard, F uh, you, you just have to pick something, for the, the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time. C And, F uh, they're big on finger food here, too. D You know, chicken wings and, F uh, ribs, and that kind of stuff. F Uh, barbecue and, F uh, cooking out in the yard, it, ya, D you know, when it's nice. Barbecue outside, chicken and that kind of stuff. F Uh, no, C but I have had shrimp. F Oh, of course. That's, Yeah. Really? Is it like shrimp? It's similar. Ch, F Oh, it does? Does, it look like a lobster? F Oh, it looks more like a crab. Oh. Are they thin, long or wide? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yep. <Laughter> Oh <laughter>. C And, C and where did you say you were from? Louisiana. F Oh, D well, do you do cajun cooking? F Oh, I love, F uh, blackened, D you know, F uh, the, the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff. F Oh! We have a few places up here that do that. C And if ever I see it on the menu, I always get it. It is so good <laughter>. D Now how do they do the blackened? C But, F uh, do you have to have a certain skillet, or something? No? I did have. I don't have it now. C But I have mostly Teflon. You now, C but, Do, does it have to get extremely hot? Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh, I see. Yeah. F Oh, I see. Oh. F Oh, really? Oh. D Now would, you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would, prepare it any other time? Is that what you're saying? F Oh, uhhuh. C Because, I could have the, F uh, chicken on the skewers, with, F uh, F uh, blackened seasoning. C And, F oh, that is so good. Delicious. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. It is. I, I love it. I, I, in fact I was in Texas for a little while. C And I liked, F uh, the barbecues and the Mexican food. I have a passion for all that type of different tastes. C Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food. C Because my, F uh, parents are Italian and Portuguese. C So we cook a lot of pasta, and, F uh, gravies, and pizzas, and, D you know, roasts, and that kind of thing. That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and have, D you know, trying different things. I would love to. I, Really? Uhhuh. Is that right? Uhhuh. D Now, wher, where do you go when you go there? F Uh, right on Basin Street and those places? Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, I see. F Oh, that's nice. Uhhuh. Really? C And don't they make a lot of, F um, I'm trying to think what they call their soup. I don't know. Yeah, jumbo. Gumbo, right. Is, is, is that with seafood? F Oh, you can? That looks good too. I've seen them d, the chefs on T V do that? C And F oh, it looks delicious. D See we do, F um, F uh, a thing, we call it a sea bake. <<Sound fading>> You, F uh, you take clams,
