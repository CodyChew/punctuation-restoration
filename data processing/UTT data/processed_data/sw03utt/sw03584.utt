D Well, tell me about your home. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. It sounds nice. F Oh, yeah? Yeah. D Well, D you know, these guys that gambled high lost big D you know. C And, F uh I'm insulating myself from that problem. I'm building my own house. C And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up <clicking> today <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. I used to be a builder. C And I retired about five years ago and started college. C And now I'm a college educated builder <laughter>. There's still no work, D you know. C So, F uh, D you know, I decided this summer that, F uh, D you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials C so I did. C And, F uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home. You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house C but you can't borrow the money to build your own. <Static> D Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say D yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home C and then it doesn't sell C and then the bank's holding the bag. D Well. As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right? Hence the savings and loan problem we have. C But, F uh, D you know, my home is, F uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to. Yeah. D Well, I figure it's just me and my wife C but, D you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, C so I want to have a shop. Ten acres. D Well, yeah. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill. C And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. Seriously. D Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy C but, D you know, he's I can just make out his place, D you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north. C And, F uh, Yeah. D Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site <clicking> because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning. D Well, it's got a, a very small furnace. C And a, F uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well. C But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, D you know, these, lo, these many months C and I have not had to use the heat. C Because it's all geothermal. C And with all the, see I've got, on the south side is all glass. D Well, as much as I could get in it, D you know. C And, F uh, the east side is glass. I've got one, two, three, four, five, <<very faint>> six windows in the east side on fortyeight feet. C So it's almost all glass. C And, F uh, F Oh, yeah. E I mean, D you know. There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows. C So, F uh, D Well, not really. It's, F uh, it's on the side of a hill. C So the first, D you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep. C And the side that's on the, F uh, the other side is about six feet high. C So I've got a pretty good grade there. C And then when I put the verandas whi, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop. Exactly. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. F Uh, right now we're living in, D well it's me, my wife and, F uh, two young boys. C And, F uh, right now we're in a, F uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it. C So we don't have a, a big yard. F Uh, C but, F uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us. C So it was enough. F Uh, C and it's, F uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. C Because it's not a full two story. Where, D you know, everything on top is on bottom. C So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house C and the other half is just standard sized ceilings. C And, F uh, it's about a five year old house now. It's, F uh, pretty nice. Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already <laughter>. Yeah. It was a, Landmark is the one who built it. Yeah. That's true. Exactly what happened to them. F Oh, that's nice. F Oh, really. Are you doing it yourself? Wow. F Oh, that's nice. F Oh, I see. F Huh. <Laughter> Yeah. That's great. R, is that so? I didn't know that. D Well that sounds kind of dumb. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Huh. <Laughter> That's right <laughter>. Yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. That's good. Yeah. How big a lot do you got it on? Wow. That's nice. That's real nice. Oh. <Laughter>. God. That's pretty good. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, that's pretty good. Uhhuh. F Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. Wow. My wife would love that <laughter>. She loves lots of windows. <Laughter> That's great. Is it a single story? F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. F Um, I see. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Noise> Yeah, that's kind of like, like a Victorian style? Yeah. I, I've always liked that. The, D you know, I, we don't have much yard C but I built a small deck in the back. C But, D you know, I, I see these magazines where, D you know, dig your, your own deck. I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, F uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
