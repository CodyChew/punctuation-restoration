Okay. Fortyeight. That's a long time. F Uh. Uhhuh. Andrews? D Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet C but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry. F Um, September really was, I'm not sure about October. I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. F Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, if you had it early. Yeah, I think we usually have a frost in October. F Uh, C but, D you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting, C and it has not today, C but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day. Flooding anywhere. I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, E I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, C but, F uh, no, I've not heard of any particular problems this time. Yes. Yes, yeah, we had summer lasting long C and then it, then it, then it became winter like, F uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day. Yeah. . I don't know. Yeah, our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now. I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we, we did, for a time. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Been that this year for the trees for the leaves. F Um. Yeah, that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early. Is that right? If it would came later it would be all right? F Um. C So what do you guys having up there? I haven't been up there since, F oh, D Lord, fortyeight, I guess <laughter>. D Well, no, it wasn't fortyeight, it was, it was, F uh, let's see, D yeah, it was fortyeight. I was in the Air Force. We did an air show out at, F uh, out at, F uh, Boone Greene, E no out at, F uh Andrews, yeah. C So what's it been like up there? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, like September was hot and dry, October. Really? F Huh. It really has been strange here this year, E I mean, this whole ye, course this whole year <laughter> has been a different year in more ways than one. C But, F uh, we had, F uh, D you know, all these, we have all these, F uh, somebody said, D you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather, <laughter> C but. D Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever, C and we had all this rain, C and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool. C But all of a sudden, in, in, F uh, in October, F uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time. C And, F uh, then the end of October it started <laughter> rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, D you know. There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal, C and then F uh, into of November, the first, D like the second week, F uh, D you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze, C and the average, D you know, the average, F uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here C but usually it's not until later <laughter>. It's really strange. Yeah. Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere? It's just kind of, F uh, clou, we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, F uh, which will be, D you know, a little bit more typical, F uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange. We haven't really had an autumn. It's like we went into winter D you know, the poor trees, said what <laughter>, Yeah, F uh, it's, Yeah, there, you, D you know, usually there's, F uh, I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas, C and D you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, D you know, it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, D you know hickories and oaks and stuff, C and, F uh, I was up there last weekend, C and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on, C and they're green, C but they're dead <laughter>. D You know, the, the freeze just got them. They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently, C and, C and we haven't had a typical fall at all. Not much color, D you know, changes have occurred at all. Really weird this year. I'm not sure what that, what that means. C So you, you all actually had some color, F huh? It kind of crept in C and, Yeah, it's usually beautiful up there isn't it? Gorgeous. That's, D you know, I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not, C and you could, D you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same. It's almost, D you know, identical kind of country. Beautiful. Yeah. Oh. <Breathing> Yeah, I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend, C so. Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it. D Well. F Uh, it, there's some trees D like the oaks, D like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy. There's, nothing bothers them. Their leaves are still green, C and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves. F Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, D you know, they got, F uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit, C but they still look pretty good. It just depends on the, on the, F uh, on the tree.
