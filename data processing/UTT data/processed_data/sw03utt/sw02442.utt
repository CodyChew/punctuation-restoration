All right. Yeah, I exercise pretty regularly. I lift weights quite a bit. F Um, I run occasionally. Let's see what else do I do. Play golf some, C and I work out on a, on a hanging bag. I'm brown belt in karate, C so I keep up with that a little bit. How about you. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that's neat. Yeah, I do walk some too. My wife's about five months along C so she's been walking quite a bit, C so that is a good exercise for that. Uhhuh. I, I do it on my own schedule. We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y, stuff like that, C but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis, to drive the distance you have to go. Save the fees, we've, F uh, just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment. C So, Yeah, I've got a weight bench, C and we got my wife an exercise bike, C and I use that sometimes too. It's a little more convenient, C but, you're, I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive <baby_talking> over to do it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I think you really have to be disciplined. I, F uh, I try to work out at least a couple of times a week, C and I think you really have to, at least twice a week, just to maintain the shape that you're in. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah, I understand. Did you exercise between your first child and your second? Yeah. F Um. Gosh. Uhhuh, yeah. Maybe it, maybe it speeded up the process and all that. Uhhuh. Really. D Well, that's good. No, I don't. My, my wife has been working with them. Uhhuh. At least its something you enjoy. I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say, D Well, I don't want to exercise, it's too much work. C But there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards. Yeah, I think we've talked about six minutes or so. Been good talking to you as well. Thanks. Yours too. Byebye. Okay, are you on an exercise program now C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Um, the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking. I've got a nine month old, C and I'm four months pregnant with my second, C and so, at the time, walking seems to be the best. It's something I can do with her, plus, F um, doesn't tax me too physically. I have enjoyed aerobics in the past, C and I enjoy that because I like the group association, D you know, like exercising with other people. C And, F um, C and that's my favorite way to exercise. Oh. Yeah, it's nice to do it together, too, I guess. My husband and I use to walk together, C but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to, C and so, we very seldom get together to walk C but, when you, when you work out, do you pretty much do it on your own schedule, C or do you go to groups C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And then you can do it whenever you want I guess. Uhhuh. I guess it depends on the person, depends on how <laughter> motivated you are. C Because my husband used to work out three days a week with, F uh, at the Texas Instruments gym. C And then I would just go on Saturdays. C But, since the first of the year neither one of us have been going. C So, I guess, like I say, we've been paying these fees and not going, C so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it. Yeah. Yeah. With the walking, I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically <<pause>> beneficial. C And we, I have two friends, that we walk. They have babies that are about the same ages as, as mine, C and we've been walking every morning at, going when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out very easily. C So we, when we go, we have about, do about fifteen miles a week, C but the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been <laughter> real consistent. So <<pause>> it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well, C but C but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me. D You know, I usually do it because I want to, because I know it's good for me, not because, I don't feel obligated to do it. I enjoy it. If I feel too obligated to do it, I start to rebel, C and I won't be as consistent with it. I exercised pretty well up until I found, F uh, until I was pregnant, C and I started having pains. C So I've calmed down everything except, I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the, F um, walking, C And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of <<pause>> painful. C But the T I rec center has an aerobics program for, for, F um, prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing. C And I was going to wait until, F um, about my sixth month and then start that. I did that with the second baby, C and, F um, I went to my exercise class one day, C and then she was delivered the next day. C So, it would seem to be real beneficial. D Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier. C And, C and is this your first that you're having? F Oh, okay, D well, then I don't know how much you've been through it, C but I think parts of it made a lot easier. C And, I've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other, C and they said that they had ex, that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier. C And we've, I had, having both of them natural, the first one was natural and going natural the second, C and, C and it's, it's rough C but <laughter> it's not as bad as I thought it would be, C and I think the exercise helped. C So, do you work with T I? F Oh, okay, D well then she could go if she were interested. I think, that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings. C So she could find out if she wanted to go. <baby_crying> It's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy, C and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process. C And so for us it was educational <laughter> as well as exercise beneficial. C So, That's right. Yeah. <laughter> C And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like, D Well I've done a good job because I got, worked myself to that point. C But I guess that you don't want to overdo. C But <baby> <<pause>>, D well have we reached our limit? I'm not sure how long we've been talking C but, Okay, D well it's been good talking to you. Okay, I hope your baby goes well comes out well. Byebye.
