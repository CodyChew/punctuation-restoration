What type of lawn and garden work do you do? I see. Do you have a garden? We do the same thing. It's, I just have a small plot it's D like ten feet by five feet. I see. Yeah, you do a lot more area than I do. I've, all the rest of my yard, backyard is, F uh, D you know, pool and decking it's all the dirt I have, left in my backyard <laughter>. D Well, I enj, I enjoy fiddling around. It's cheap entertainment. It is, uhhuh. That's right. Yeah. I enjoy, E Excuse me, go ahead. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Takes a lot of room. It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was. They do. D Well, it was very good it just takes up, D you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area. It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic we just do, F oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, E I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that. My wife used to plant a few snow peas. I don't really care for snow peas. D Well, she just plants a few for herself. Yeah. Did you really? F Oh, I see. Okay. We don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, D you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground. Probably so. Yeah, you can get a head start on it. <Noise> <<sounds like ice in glass.>> I guess it, it, might would, yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> D Well it will make, it will make them taste better I'm sure. Sure. You got to inspect it, yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. No. I, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system, C and D boy, it is really nice, it sure beats dragging hoses around. That's right. That's right. It's really nice. Uhhuh. I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard. I, I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard, I just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done. I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, D you know, until I retired C and now I, I've lost my excuse for that so I have to <laughter>, for the last couple of years I've done it myself. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It is kind of expensive, it is. Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too. That's right. If I have a problem discipline, D you know, I think, D now, boy, I really need to get out, D you know, and apply something, D you know, C and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something. That's right. That's right. I'm, I'm kind of bad about that. I enjoyed having a lawn service C but now I have the time C and I really can't, I really don, D you know, don't, want to spend the money for it. Yeah. That's right. I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, D you know, I can do it on most any day of the week. Uhhuh. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. That's coming up here pretty soon. Is it this weekend? It's pretty soon. Yeah. <Noise> <<ice>> I believe it is too. D Well, F Uh, not a whole lot, F uh. I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, D you know. I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it C but then, again, I don't want the bugs eating it upping either. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. That's right. Absolutely. They really go through it, they really do. Yeah. D You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too. Boy, they'll strip, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before, I've got, my garden is shaped that I can, it's kind like this, F uh, box shape, C so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch D like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure C and, D you know, various other things, Raised it up. C And I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have, F oh, I'll have less of a bug problem any, at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, Right. Uhhuh. That's right, you, you have to work on. You, really do. That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, D you know, for my garden C so I had, I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with, No. I don't, I did it by hand, Uhhuh. It wasn't too much of a job, really. Like I say it's just, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It would be handy. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. It might be handy, They're pretty neat little, I've never seen one. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh <Noise> <<Ice rattling>>. Right. Yeah. That would be neat, sure. We've had a garden, D gosh, for years and years and years, of some size, D you know, I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind. F Uh, got, you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom C and, F uh, I've got carrots, E I mea, D yes, I've got a few carrots up C and I've got some radishes up, C and as a matter of fact, I've already done a second row of radishes. C And, F uh, the green onions are coming along. Snow, E excuse me. Yes, I've for the first time we planted them this year. Yeah. We tried to find them last year, we screwed around and waited too long C and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left. C But we've got some this year. Snow peas are up C and, F uh, my wife does, F uh, a small herb garden on the side. They're up and doing fine. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a, let down. F Oh, I bet, they were. That's right. We use a lot, we sure do. Yeah. One nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, D you know, too many. Yeah. Uhhuh. We did that too, Uhhuh. Sure. Makes, F uh, makes a colorful salad too. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. We planted some yellow peppers this year. We've tried it, before C and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year. They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something. Yeah. We enjoy fooling around with it. Beets. Yeah, we've got some beets, uhhuh. Uhhuh. I've never done potato. We used to do it at home when I was a kid, had a huge garden. Uhhuh. It takes a, D yeah, it does take some space. Yeah. Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That will be neat, yeah. Uhhuh. That will be neat, yeah. Absolutely, they're expensive. I don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. I really, don't know. That will be interesting. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. That's interesting. D Well, I'll let you go it's, D Well, I do it all <laughter>. F Uh, yes. I, I try to grow, F uh, F uh, a vegetable garden C and, Yeah. I have two plots, one's ten by ten C and one's D like fifteen by four. It's a long skinny one C and, F Oh, I see. Yeah. I see. Right. Right. Yeah, it's nice to get out in the open air. C And especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever, C but, F uh, sometimes I, E I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space D you know. I grow a lot of things, a lot of food. C And sometimes I, I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like, F uh, D you know, the things that vine D like, F uh, cucumbers, or, F uh, squash or something, like that. Plant one of those C and it takes up your whole space <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. They, they just run all over, the place, don't they, Right. Right. . The basics. Right. Yeah. That's what we do too. Right. Peas I, I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago. The first one, they started them indoors this time. I read it, C And so I, Yeah. I, F uh, I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that, C But, F uh, sure is a heck of a lot of work. C Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered C and I, I don't think I'll do it again <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, I enjoy it. I come home from work C and, C and I usually say hello to wife and kids, and then go out and fiddle, D you know, just walk around the yard and inspect it C and the kids want to swing, C and I push them on swing. C And I wal, I mow my own lawn. C And I do, I don't have a sprinkler system. I, I don't enjoy watering. Especially, F Oh how, Oh. Yeah, you can have it come on just early in the morning. And, and off by the, D you know, by the time you're up and about. Yeah. I, I usually get it started for my wife C and I, C and she moves it around <laughter> ever other day. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, F uh, chemical services to come, out and spray for weeds, and fertilize, and all that and take that one step out of. C But, F uh, they want too much money. Yeah. Right. Right. C But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself. Right C and the weed come up, C and all of a sudden you've got to do something else. Yeah. D Well, if you, enjoy it too, D you know, you, you can get out in the morning when, before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to, Right. When the days start getting a little longer, D you know, you can, I can start doing it in the evening after work. When they, when they switch to, switch, when we get an hour more, when they rollback an hour. I don't know. I really don't know. It just seems like I here it on the news the day before. C And, F uh, I, I think it's coming up here soon. Yeah. Yeah. Are you having any trouble with bugs in, in your garden? Uhhuh. Right. Right. I, I, it seems like they come in spurts. One year I didn't put anything on C and I didn't have any problems. Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever. They were just covered with them, E I mean, I went up, I didn't go out there for about three days, D you know, C because I, C and I went out there one day and the plant was noth, nothing left but a stem, they devoured it that quickly. C And, they, they, have a, you, a good appetite <laughter>. C And they would, D you know, I, I picked off D like twenty of them C and, Ye, yeah. They got that, F uh, what is that safer soap, F uh, B T spray this, year. C And I've been watching them every day C and I've, C and I haven't seen any signs yet. C So, if I see any signs I'm going to spray them, C and, F uh, Right. D Well, the good stuff. Right. Right. Yeah, my backyard is, F uh, is sloping C so I built a box up, D you know had to build the one, the low side up. C And, F uh, I had sandy loam hauled in. I had a dump truck come and dump it. On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do C and then, I had to wheel barrow it in. C But, F uh, D you know, you can improve your own soil there C but the Texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil. Right. C And D you know, if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean <laughter>. Uhhuh. Do you have, do you have a rotor tiller? Small enough, you have a, just do it by hand? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to get one of these little small ones, that you see in all these gardening magazines. C And it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that. My neighbor across the street has one. He always uses it to dethatch his lawn, I see him out there, C and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it. Yeah. Yeah. I have a friend who has one C and, C and he lets me, D you know, no problem borrowing if it's, just a hassle when D you know, to go up C and it's a fairly large one to, heave it up into the back of the van, bring it home and, check it back and just grab it, D you know, if I, just go to my garage and grab it. That would be nice. Uhhuh. What have you got growing right now? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Okay, what kind, what kind of onions do you grow? Do you grow those, those ten, fifteen Y? F Oh, they, they are the best. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, those, I see. Yeah. I, F uh, those onions, I think, we, we planted D like twice as much this year because, D you know, we got, on, onions C and they lasted from, D you know, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until D like October, C and, F uh, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare. She made these onion rings that were so good, C and, C and, C and, F uh, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in, that it's an ingredient, C and, C and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better. Right. Right. We froze a lot of peppers. We let some turn red. C And some we do green C and then my wife puts them on pizzas. And, and chops them up in recipes and things like that. F Oh, yeah. Put them in salad, yeah. You're, you're making me hungry here. <Laughter>. Oh. Yellow peppers, F huh. Yeah. Sounds like you have a real good garden. Just let me see what I got, I got the peas C and I've got some broccoli, F uh, onions some, some radishes and, F uh, F uh, beets. F Uh, C and I planted potatoes too. F Oh, the potato, They were, they're delicious C but they, you don't get, seem to get that much for the space, they, they do. Some beet, F uh, potatoes C and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers, I got to wait for a place to, to, to free up. F Uh, our, our kids love pickles C and we all love pickles C so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year. We've got some good, F um, F um, Hybrid Burpee F uh F uh, pickler cucumbers C and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own C and, C So, because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store? I know it. I said, why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers, D you know? <Laughter>. I guess. C But we're going to try that, and see how that works. An experiment. I'd like to try, D you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before C and, D Well.
