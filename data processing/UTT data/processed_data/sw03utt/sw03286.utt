D Well, I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, D well, if there is a problem, what should we do about it? Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America? Okay. That's interesting. I was, I was wondering what your response would be. I'm a first generation American. C So I'm, from immigrant parents <laughter>. Or an immigrant mother anyway. F Uh, Poland. C And that was, D you know, prior to World War Two. C But it's interesting that, D you know, with the topic I think I agree with you. There needs to be more of an open policy. C And D you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor, D you know, for the railroad, Transatlantic Railroad C and, our Irish came and, D you know, built the towns and, did labor. C But what do you think, are you from Texas C or, Pennsylvania. Okay. D Well, that will be interesting. C Because we have just, had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, A I'm from Texas and have become citizens now. What do you think about that? D Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly. The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey. C So, when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to? <laughter>. C Because Texan philosophy is a little different. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well we, F Oh, D well, then you have first in the experience on immigration. D Well, that is interesting. Yeah. D Well, I wonder, D you know, even with those that were involved with Tienamen's Square. D You know, did we really protect them? Yeah. That is true. That is true. D Well, what do you think about, we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population that has been brought in. What do you think about that? C And these are not the brightest. E I mean we we're talking boat people. We have a lot of boat people in Texas. You're a true liberal hearttoheart. Good for you. <Laughter> I was ready for a fight on this one <laughter>. No, I agree because, F um, interesting, my, when my daughter was in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese C and with his limited English they found out, thr, D you know, that, she was in student council, C and they found out that he was a medical doctor, C So, what do you think about it? Right <laughter>. Yeah, I guess that's so. F Um, F uh, I think there's some problems, C but they're not really big ones. I think that, F um, in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be. That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America. It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that. Okay. F Uh, where did you come from? Okay. Okay, C so where did your parents come from? Okay. C And, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yep. Uhhuh. I'm from Pennsylvania. Yeah. Right, C and, F uh, a lot of, Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, I think that's all right. I, F um, at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing. Do you have an opinion about it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, <laughter> okay. Right. D Well, a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brotherinlaw who's Chinese and immigrated from China. C And, F um, D you know he, F um, got a green card is, and is in good standing in America and China, but only because he was always nice to the Chinese government, and all that, C and he was always on pretty good terms with them. C But, F um, their, my sister just had a baby C and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to D like help care for the kid and that sort of thing. C And it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem. It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, that's, C and I think that's pretty crazy, because E I mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back, C and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China C so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can. <<Very faint>> Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, D See, these are refujees, you mean? Okay. Right, okay. Right. D Well, F um, I don't have any problem with that. F Um, Yeah, <laughter> I guess so <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah.
