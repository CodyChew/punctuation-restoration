D Well, you keep up with current events? Not, Is that right? Yeah, where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania. Where in Pennsylvania? F Oh, do you, D well, great. How's, F uh, D well no, we're not supposed to talk about that. We're supposed to talk about current events. D Well, I'm a current event junkie. C So I, I watch, I try to watch the news, C and I read the newspaper, C and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world. . D Well, I just, pretty, F uh, little, D you know, about everything. C And, not C and then again not everything, C but D you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening. Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, D you know C but, F uh, other than that, F uh, I just, D you know, just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and know, feel like I know what's going on. Now I have to say all three of my children, <laughter> none of them are too interested in current events. C But I always have been C and I stay up with it. C But, F uh, how do you, how do you, F uh, stay aware of most of the current events. F Uh, newspaper? T V news, or what? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, that's good. D Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yes, uhhuh. F Oh, you've been there D well, you would be interested in it then. Yeah, F uh, I follow it, D you know, I don't just read everything about it, C but I'm always aware of what's going on like that C and, F uh, C because it is, it's interesting C and, F uh, I don't know, I feel sorry for those people down there, they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, D you know. E I mean, through Papa Doc, E I mean he was a terrible tyrant C and I think it's been better since he died, C but it's still been bad C but, F uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, F uh, I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself. Yeah, he was pretty, pretty much a, he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, D you know. C But, F uh, It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, D you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them, C but, F uh, C but then again, who, D you know, those people are so used to it I guess it's the only thing that works. I think it's pretty darned good, I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have I really do. D Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme, the media does, C but, F uh, C but, that's kind of understandable, because, D you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, E I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over, C and I listen to the radio C so I, you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, C but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe C but I think the quality of our, F uh, our news is just, F uh, I don't believe it could be better I really don't. I don't think so. I don't think our news could be better. E I, I mean, E I mean, what else could they do to make it better. I don't see anything that they could do. D Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon I understand what you're saying, C But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it. F Uh nothing is perfect. Uhhuh. D Well, that's true, I understand what you're saying, C and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper, that's why we have C N N. C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper. F Um, somewhat. Yeah, somewhat not as well as I would like to probably C but that's the way it goes. What? F Um, State College, I go to Penn State. Yep. Right, exactly, F uh. I see. D Well, what particularly are you interested in? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> I see. Uhhuh. F Um F uh, D well, some of both. I read, I read the newspapers sometimes C and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally C and I read magazines, and such. D Well, yeah, E I mean, not, not that badly anyway, C so I am, I am interested in what's going on, C and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there C and, yeah. Right, exactly. Yep, Uhhuh. That's true. They've never really had a good leader, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah? Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America? Uhhuh. Right, right. Yep. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, D you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better, C but I, would agree that it's pretty good. Yeah. F Um. Yeah, D well, I think that, F um, I don't know. <Laughter> The, F um, Right. Right, I think that, D Well, that may be so, yeah. I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such. Right. Uhhuh. Right.
