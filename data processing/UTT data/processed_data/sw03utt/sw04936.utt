Why don't you start? Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that? Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing? Yeah. I've done both <throat_clearing>. F Uh, F uh, my wife has picked up a couple of things saying, F uh, D boy if we could refinish that, that would be a <noise> beautiful piece of furniture C and, F uh, we've done it a couple of times. I guess that we've been fairly successful with those. That's, F uh, that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess. F Uh, I have a, a, F uh, really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which <laughter> I got because my sister who worked in a hospital, F uh liberated it after a fire C and, F uh, we stripped it all the way down and refinished it C and it turned out to be really nice, F uh, a nice desk. Maple top I think or <throat_clearing> or something of that sort. F Oh, really? F Oh. I'm jealous. Uhhuh. Yeah <throat_clearing>. I, I do do things, F uh, that might be too crude to be called woodworking. I've built my own deck and, F uh <Sniffing> things like that. C And, F uh <Throat_clearing> I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too. My, I, F uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive C and so I do have a band saw and a router and, F uh, things like that out in the garage. C But I can't say I use them very often <throat_clearing>. They're handy, F uh, they they come in handy at the most unusual times. Putting doors in is the time when I'm, F uh, I bought myself a, F uh, template for making mortices and doors C and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel <laughter>. C But I've, also, I've also used them for building drawers where you, F uh, for rabbeting and, F uh, because, F uh, rabbeting on my table, on my, F uh, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain <laughter>. C So, I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it C and now I use it twice a year maybe <throat_clearing>. The big, <Throat_clearing> F Uh, I guess it, <Throat_clearing> The ones that what? F Uh, I have never even s, I have never even looked at one closely. F Uh, the, the little use that I've gotten from my router, E I would say, F uh, I would spend my money on the bits <laughter>. F Uh, I have a, I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router C and the, F uh, <Throat_clearing> It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say threeeighths of an inch at a time. C But the problem is that the, F uh, as with any, any time you buy a, a tool with a, a, as a, as a package the bits that they give you are low end. <Throat_clearing> C So the price of a good set of, F uh, carbide steel, F uh, bits is probably, F uh, E I mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars C and, F uh, F uh, if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it. C Because y, e, F uh, I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself, F uh, they won't last <throat_clearing>. C And I've never had the bits sharpened <sniffing>. C So. That's a thing to consider is to, Yeah. C And they, they dull after awhile. Especially, I did some cabinets in, F uh, ash and oak C and, F uh, that, that wears a bit down. We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets, F uh which had been in the original, remodeling of our kitchen. <Swallowing> C And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth <throat_clearing>. C And, F uh, routing hardwood will, F uh, take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast <sniffing>. C So. Right. That's, F uh, C And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened, right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah <throat_clearing>. D Well I've used mine on treated wood C and now all my blades need sharpening. Because, F uh, treated wood will also chew them up. F Oh, I don't know. I, F uh, I refinished a couple of old, F uh, dressers that were gi, handed down. D You know, nice it's nice tongue and groove, F uh, F uh, construction. F Uh, <inhaling> that's been, I've been pretty successful with that. What? No, I've done some other things too. F Uh, D you know. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to get started. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh <<very faint>> <clink>. Yeah. I, I, F uh, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch. D You know, a kit. Yeah. Still had to cut it and everything, C but it was fun. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I've done the same. D You know, like the trim around the house <laughter> D you know the baseboards and things like that. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah , I'm looking at trying to get a router right now. . <Laughter> I'll bet. <Talking> Uhhuh. Yeah. My br, my brother's used it a lot for making drawers. I don't know, what, what's your opinion of wha, what a good router is like? D You know I, C Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great. They've plastic parts and stuff. That you dial in on the side. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. How strong is it? Don't they, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. They, they really get hot don't they? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Children>. Right. <Talking>. Yeah. I've cut some one by eight oak before <laughter>. Boy was that fun. Big solid pieces of oak are just tough. <Laughter> D Well, that was, D you know, with a, with a circular saw. D Like, F oh my gosh. Is this going to be fun <laughter>? <Children> Yeah. Treated wood can really make you sick too.
