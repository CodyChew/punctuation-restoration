Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel, C and then I'll respond. Yeah. D Well, how long have you been here? D Well, Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good excuse. You need to get into the <laughter> the system a little more and know where to take things. We've been here probably two and a half years, and, and we didn't recycle at all before we came C so I think we're doing well. We, we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now. D Well, the, F um, glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart. They have, F um, in behind Walmart they have bins C and then we usually save up our cans and, and change them in for money. Uhhuh. F Um, there's a place on Parker Road, F um, it's just over the overpass before you get D like to KMart. I think there's a, a service station there. There's usually a semi truck that has a, a person there that will weigh them C and, Now they aren't worth much right now, C but <laughter> it's better than nothing <laughter>, C so C and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now, C and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October. Yeah, C and, <Laughter> I think it's been delayed. I think it was originally scheduled for February, C but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with from what I've read in, D you know, the mail that we get C and I can't wait for that, that will be easy. I get tired of newspaper littering the garage <laughter>. I feel guilty we don't recycle our, our milk containers because they seem like a big waste. Yeah yeah, they fill up the whole kitchen <laughter> garbage can C so, I'll be glad when the bins do come, C and I think that's when I'll, I'll start doing the plastic, too. Yeah. I've gotten used to washing the, D you know, the, F um, salad dressing bottles and <laughter> things like that, it's not that big of a deal, C and it's nicer to just throw them out, C but we can do our part <laughter> take an extra minute or two. F Oh, when we first were, were here, it was like we'd take maybe a, F oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full, C and it would be like two dollars C but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar. Yeah which is understandable, I think, more people are are recycling. That's something we, we don't really make any effort to, C and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, D you know, the, the cans C and that was kind of fun, C but we haven't done that for a long time D so. <Laughter> D Well, the boys think it's fun, plus you get your exercise C and <laughter>, you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest <laughter>, D so C but. D Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month C and that will spur you on, C so <laughter>. <Laughter> All right, D well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, <Laughter> Trying <laughter> that's all you can do D so. F Um, yeah, you can do it as long as you want. They, D you know, if it's been long enough, five minutes is, is when they cut in and say, say, we don't have any more room for recording <laughter>. C So we can say goodbye now. It was good talking to you, C and maybe we'll get on line again. Thanks, Sherry. Byebye. All right. D Well, I'm, F uh, I'm very guilty of, of not doing my part with recycling, I'm afraid. We, F um, recently moved here from North Carolina, C and <inhaling> they had curbside recycling, C and it was very easy to, D you know, to put everything out there, C but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now C and, F uh, C so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to, to take things where take things where they belong. D Well, we've been here since January, C so we, we still feel very new, C but, F uh it's working up to a year now, C so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, where do you take those things? Uhhuh. D Well, where do you do that, C because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir F um, C but I didn't know where to take them. Oh. Yeah. Better than nothing, right. Yeah, I, it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, D you know it's coming in a couple of months, C but <laughter>. Oh. Right. Yeah, it gets to be a bit much to haul it off, C but. D Well, they, D yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway yeah. Right. Yeah, it was real easy with the bins, it really was, it was just no effort at all, F um, no more trouble than taking out the garbage, C so, F um, Right. Yeah. D Well, how much do you earn on the cans, I, I didn't know ho, what kind of an idea to give her for, Uhhuh. Yeah. C So it's gone down. Yeah, Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that sounds like a pretty good project. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Oh. D Well, I'll have to keep myself and, and ge, get on it. My neighbor across the street, F um, is so careful about recycling, C and so I keep telling myself, I'll, I'll get it organized, C but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first. Right, right, I won't have any excuse then, that's for sure. Thinking about it, anyway <laughter>. Yeah, C but, D Well, F um, have you, do they time this thing for us, C or do we, You can't chat all day, F huh <laughter>. Okay. Okay. Byebye.
