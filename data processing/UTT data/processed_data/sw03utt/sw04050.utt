I pressed the button one, C so we're recording right now. I'm sorry <laughter>. Okay, C and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah. Yeah. <laughter> F Um, okay, Bill, we're talking about family reunions. Okay, F um, have you ever had to plan a family reunion? Oh. Uhhuh. C And how did you feel it went? Oh. All this planning and, and getting together and such. F Um, F oh, let's see what else. Uhhuh. F Oh, boy <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. <laughter> D Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together? Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh, C and then did you have a main meal, C or did everyone just bring, it was just pot luck. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, show off a little bit <laughter>. Oh. Oh. Now how old is she? F Oh, goodness. Is she pretty spry, is she, D you know, pretty. F Oh, wow. Uhhuh. Oh. <laughter> F Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age. Yeah. Really. <laughter> D Well that sounds fun. D Well, I <smack> I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago, C and there were, we sent out five hundred, F uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there. C And so that was a real challenge, C and I was president of our family reunion for two years, C and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row, <laughter> C but I found that advance planning was the key to success. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's wonderful, though <laughter>. <Laughter>. Oh. F Oh, D well, that is, that is helpful. Yeah, our family ranges from, F oh, goodness, D well, Australia, I have a brother lives in Australia, to, F uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, F uh, all kinds of places. We are <laughter>. Oh. In. Oh. Uhhuh. Boy. F Oh, my gosh. <Laughter> They must really like it there. Yeah. <laughter> Oh. F Oh, <laughter> you're ready to move on to bi, Hello. That's okay. I'm Bill from Raleigh. F Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas. Right. F Uh, yes C and no, it wasn't really a fa, a planning one, C but it was kind of, F uh, it was a birthday C and I brought a lot of family together then. It went pretty good. I'm, I've worked in hotels, C so I, I kind of know how to do these things. I used to, D you know. Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday, C and C and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family. She has like seven sisters I think. They show up and all their kids. C And then all, she has, F uh, I have D like, F uh, let's see, she has four sons and two daughters, C and they show up and all their kids, C so it's a pretty big reunion, it's about two hundred people, maybe. F Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, D you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, F uh. I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, F um, for the rent, we rented D like a, a rescue squad building or something like that. C And, F uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for D like soft drinks C and C and so nobody D like really got stuck with the bill. C And each person in the family, D you know, brought a dish, or something. It was kind of pot luck. D You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say. Yeah. C And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook. F Uh, she's eightysix. Now she does, she looks probably like she's in her early sixties C and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. My nickname for her is Honey Woman. That's what I call her. F Uh, also one thing that's helpful, C and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever C but most of, all my family lives D like in the same county C so <laughter>, C But it's just kind of like get on the telephone C and, it's so and such days from such and such date C and everybody just shows up. I would say you're spread out, then. F Uh, my immediate family, D you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever, C because my dad was in the Army C and we're we're pretty strung out all over. C But since they've moved back to Carolina's, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County. I live in Raleigh, C and then my, my parents live in Greenville, C and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, F uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville. C So E I mean, we're, we're spread out, C but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro C so. Nobody moves away except us <laughter>. Yeah, I got out as soon as I graduated. Just like this town is too small for me, Goodbye.
