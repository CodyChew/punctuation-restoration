F Uh, we do here. F Uh, D see, what do we recycle? We, they recycle, they have bins C and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, F uh, plastic bottles C and I think that's all they have. What about you guys? Uhhuh. Really? For smashed cans? Uhhuh. F Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute? I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, D okay, just succeed <beep>. F Oh, okay, D well, I guess, I guess, Yeah <laughter>. Okay, D well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can. D Well, when you buy D like, F uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit? Yeah. Exactly C and so it's like they charge you for the deposit, C so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, D like, reimbursed. Type of thing. That's sort of nice, though <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so you guys can actually get ahead <laughter>. C But, F uh, they have sort of D like, F uh, things that you c, you're not D like reimbursed for or paid for. D Like we can recycle, F uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. F Uh, C and milk jugs and, F uh, newspapers, D you know, everyone does newspapers. C But, that, that kind of stuff. C But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, F uh, it doesn't fit in their little containers C and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something. Yeah <laughter>. Exactly, yeah, send it to this address, no <laughter>. C But, F uh, <lipsmack> let's see, they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, F uh, Yeah, that's, Uhhuh. As likely to do it. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's good. F Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because E I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other. C And <throat_clearing> one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops. C And that way, D you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for, C but you, you got the use out of it C and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for. C And so that's something that I've never, I, we're, we're new to Iowa C so <noise> that's something that I hadn't, D you know, looked into before. C But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess. D Well, do you do any recycling? Yeah. Oh. D Well, we, F uh, there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, F uh, aluminum cans. C But, F uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, F uh, places, F uh, they're like unattended aluminum can smashers <laughter>. C And you can go up there and, and, F uh, redeem, we've got one that gives you D like a penny a can, C so if you, Yeah <laughter>. D Well, D actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed. C And, F uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot. Sure. Okay. Okay? D Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time <laughter>. F Uh, no, you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that. F Oh, okay. Okay, no, they don't charge us that extra nickel. Yeah, it, it really is. Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way. C So when we get D like, F uh, F uh, a twelve pack, then that's D like twelve cents back. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, everybody does newspapers. Yeah. D Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, F uh, Pepsi cans and whatever up there <laughter>. <Laughter>. I, I, I tell you what, what really works, F uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, A you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. F Uh, In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good C but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, F uh likely to do it as if, F uh, if you get something back for it. D You know. C And, F uh, C so, D you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, D you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, D you know, to get money or doing your banking. D You know, if it's free, people will use it, if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it. You know. C But, F uh, I know we had a problem down here with, F uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the d, D you know, the s, the drain sewer. C And, F uh, all that, because there was, apparently a lot of people, D you know, every time they change the oil, they just dump all the res, their old oil down there. Now they're starting to recycle that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of places, they, F uh, F uh,
