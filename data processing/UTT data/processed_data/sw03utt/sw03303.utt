Okay, you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or who you think will be doing well this year. Are we talking about, is this the N B A? This is college, College, okay <laughter>. Uhhuh. C And D see that's probably all, all I saw. I, we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas C and there's so many <laughter> colleges and universities in Texas, we haven't really followed them too much C and none of them are our, our alma mater <laughter>, C so, that seems to help. F Uh, I, I follow it especially around the playoffs, C so, course, I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz, C and the Mailman or Karl Malone was, D you know, pretty big thing C and, the Lakers have always been amazing to watch. I, I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks. They've not had any good seasons <laughter> for a long time, and have a lot of problems with, with Tarpley C and, maybe now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it C but, Yeah, I hope they do something. They need to C or they're not going to have <laughter> any of the team left at all. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. Kind of like the Cowboys <laughter>, I guess. Yeah, they, coming out of it this year. We'll see if it's held on. The Bulls? Yeah. They'll probably be pretty good. Course, the Celtics are always really, <throat_clearing> really good, too, with their players. Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the, the N B A players playing on the Olympic team. D So, Yeah. I don't know, how close I'll follow them, though. C And the season hasn't started yet. I'm usually more the end of the season person, C and we need to talk about baseball <laughter> C and so, D Well, It's, yeah, yeah. It is, it is, C and that's why I've, I guess my mind went blank. It's like last season was so long ago C and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet C so, C But, this wasn't a good subject, C but, <Laughter> We'll see how our predictions come true. <Laughter> Okay, it's good talking to you. All righty, bye. F Uh, D well, where I'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference C and, course, we have Duke University that was the national champions last year, C so I'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year. They have a lot of the same players back. No, this is college basketball. Right. We have like Carolina, and Duke, and Georgia Tech, and N C State, teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty. C So, hopefully we'll have a good year. I don't really <throat_clearing> follow the N B A very closely. Do you like professional basketball? Yeah. <Cough>. D Well, that's an up and coming team, though. That's somebody you can get behind and, be patient. Yeah, they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons. C But, I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again. Yeah, uhhuh. That's true. That's true, it will be interesting. It will certainly be different <cough>. <Cough>. <Cough>. Yeah, F oh, my Atlanta Braves. D Well, I really do, F uh, D you know, the basketball season's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks. It's a long season. Yeah. It's a little early. We definitely will. Good to talk to you. Byebye.
