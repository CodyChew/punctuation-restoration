Here goes Sharon. D Well <throat_clearing>, what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars? That's the only thing I found out tonight <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than D like football players would. Wonder because football, C And a lot more games, right? Uhhuh. Beats me. E I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games <laughter>. through the years. We have been talking about this, I tried to call earlier, C and we had made a list of all these, F uh, baseball teams and the cities that they were from, then I started cleaning C and I don't even know where I even put that paper <laughter>. Yeah. I was just cleaning and throwing, <Breathing> D Well, have you ever played baseball? D Well, that's what I did when I was growing up. That was fun. Uhhuh. <<Music in background.>> Do you ever go see the Rangers? Yeah. I think it's fun, I like just looking at the billboards. Yeah, it's nice at night. That's when I've been. D Well, No. C And your going to be able to buy your, what was, D no, wait about the liquor? F Oh, yeah, C so you, D Well, they're trying. Uhhuh <noise>. Uhhuh, right. F Oh <breathing>. D Well, that's the way to do it. You hear that? <noise>. That's my kids turning on their music. . <<Speaks to child in the background>> Holly turn it down. I think it's the Bart man, the Simpsons <laughter>. I wish I could <laughter>. D Well, where are you? Okay, I'm in Garland. Yeah, my h, my husband teaches in Plano. C V A E. I teach, C but I teach for Dallas. For right now. I'm trying to get out. <<Background noises and voices.>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. E I mean it's good because they, they try new things, D you know, C but it's like, they'll try something C and then they throw it out, and get something else, D you know, C and you get tired of that. <Breathing>. Yeah. D Well, C but they can't be though, they don't have as much money. Most of the time. F Oh D man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration, there's so many of them <laughter>. <Laughter> E I mean, somebody walks in the, a classroom C and you don't know what they're there for, D you know, when they're coming, how long they're going to be, D you know, it's just there they are C and they're writing the whole time <throat_clearing>. No. I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything, C and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, D you know, may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, D you know. C Because, D you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report C or, <Cough> C and they'll tell you they've written something down, C and you hope they're telling you <laughter> the truth. No <laughter>, huhuh. F Oh, it is. F Uh, this is my eleventh year. <Laughter> No, actually it's, now my job's good, much better than a lot, because I'm Chapter One, C and all I do is teach reading all day long, C and it's just ten children at a time. No. It's good, C and you've got a lot of federal money, too. Teaching? <noise>. F Oh, yes. Yes, when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my C and I said, D okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, D you know, C so I'll know what I'm suppose to teach C and they go, we don't have one. We don't even know where one is. C And so I go, okay, E I mean, you just, you did <laughter>, what you wanted to do, <Throat_clearing> C and now they tell you what to teach and how long and, D you know, what day, what period. Yeah. No, I know which is worse. <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh. D Well, you can talk for ten minutes C but you don't have to. Yeah, C and no, if you talk to ten then they come ov, on and say, F oh, you've extended your limit, C and please say goodbye within the next five seconds. D Well, D you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio, C and we started talking about gangs, D you know. Yeah. C And, <throat_clearing> everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here. C But, she was real interesting. C And then tonight this woman called, have you taken any incoming calls? Okay. C So hers was the first one I got, gotten C and, F uh, C and she was telling me all her problems, D you know, C and it went over ten minutes. D Well, yeah, we did, C but the topic was boring I thought. What would you serve, F uh, if you were having a dinner party? F Oh yeah, I could go on and on about that. D Ugh, neat. No. The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE, WITH THE WOLVES, WOLVES. F Oh, I enjoyed it. E I mean, it was just more for my money. F Huh. Uhhuh. One is eight C and one is eleven. They usually pick their own. D You know, they've got it all figured out. D Well, and Ninja Turtles. C But most of the time really we watch them on the video. Don't you? Just massive rental. Going to, I know. That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just, plug it in. I know <<Voice in background>>. It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though C and they're cheap C and nobody has got them yet. Unbelievable <sniffing>. <<Background music gets even louder.>> Uhhuh. Do you read? No? D See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night. You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago? D Well, I was reading the book, C and it's called SHOELESS JOE. It was so wonderful. C And then I was, F um, I decided, D well, I like this author, C so I got a, F uh, book of his short stories, C and that's been real good. Don't, don't ask me <laughter>. The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book. Yes, quite a, quite a bit. C But, D you know, in the movie the guy was black, he wasn't in the book, that's one difference. There really wasn't a lot of difference. D Well, do you think we covered baseball? Okay, D well, have a good night. Okay. F Oh, you found that out tonight? I haven't even heard that, that's great. I think he deserves every penny of it. C But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting. F Oh, yeah. C And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too. Yeah, that's exactly right. C But I think, let's see, the teams that were there last year were, <<pause>> D see, somebody from California, I don't even know who won the pennant last year. Yeah <laughter>. Not lately though <laughter>. Uhhuh. Threw it away <laughter>. F Oh, gosh. Let's see. The teams that, I think the A's were in it last year. The Oakland A's, and I think it was, I don't think it was an all California baseball. I played softball. Yeah. Yeah, that's fun <laughter>. That's a whole different sport. Yeah, let's see, C but I think, I think the Rangers need to go C and I think the Pirates will go. C And, F uh, let's see, <<pause>> Rangers have got a new guy this year, I don't even remember his name either. Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there, not very many people out there. It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd. Yeah. B, sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun. Yeah. It is. C And do you know anything about that new stadium, have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there? Yeah, that, that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium C and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it. C And, F uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center out there. Cou, That's, that's in, F uh, Texas stadium where the football players, play C and they're never going to let liquor in there. I know, C but they try every year C and every year they get thrown out. It's so stupid because they let you take it in there, C but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there. C But, F uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice, C and I heard that there's, F uh, that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you, C so. C And it's going to go to the highest bidder <laughter>. Yeah, C so that could be your, D you know, fifteen minutes of fame. Oh. F Oh, God <laughter>. I stay away from them. <Laughter> I bet you do. In Plano. F Oh, you are? F Oh, what's he teach? Uhhuh. D So, what do you do? F Oh, you do? Is that a tough system to be in? Real hard? Yeah, I would think it, Yeah. That's typical bureaucracy though. That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones, I don't know, sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad. Yeah, C but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes. You don't even know who to payoff, F huh? <laughter>. Yeah, F oh, how funny. No communication whatsoever. <Laughter>. Yeah. I know. C And you never see it. That's got to be frustrating. How long you taught, taught in Dallas schools? F Ugh, that's about, F uh, ten too many. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, D well, that's not bad. C But hasn't it changed a lot over the years? Yeah. C Or working in the system. F Oh, God <laughter>. How funny. Yeah, you don't know which is, you don't know, which is worse. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, being told what to do is worse. D So, how long are we suppose to talk for? F Oh, you can? F Oh, I haven't ever talked that long. Uhhuh. He lives in Cleveland? Wow. Yeah. F Huh. Th, yours is my second one. <Laughter>. Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all? Oh. F Oh, gosh, all the other, the one I talked about the other night was good, it was, F um, about movies, D you know, what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that. Me, too, because we go all the time, the guy I was talking to never goes, he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this. I said, I see at least two a week <laughter>. C So, that was real good to talk about that. Have you seen D like, F uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? You've got to go see that. Yeah, we talked about that one too. C And he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long C but I, I did, too. Yeah. I didn't think it was too long at all. F Uh, he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch. The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. C And, how old are your kids? You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids. I bet they do. Yeah, they want to see all the horror movies. Yeah, Ninja Turtles, got to have those. F Oh, yeah, you brin, that's, D well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, F uh, taking them out to the show. Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni, one time. Yeah. Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything, decent. That's true. That's true. We saw, F um, HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight. It was okay, it was kind of slow, C and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end, D you know. It just, it, I don't know, it one of those movies it's not going to be around long, it will be a dollar movie in no time. Not very much, no. I don't have the patience to read <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time. Yeah, sure did. F Oh, really? Who is the, is the author? Oh <laughter>. Shoeless Joe. Was it like the movie? Okay. Right. F Huh. I didn't, D see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie. That's interesting. That was a good movie, too. I think so <laughter>.
