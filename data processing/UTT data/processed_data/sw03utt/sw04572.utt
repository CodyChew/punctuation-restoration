D So, F uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy? F Oh, I don't know. I had a little bit more time to think about it. I was thinking of, D like, F uh, <sniffing> I don't know, I was ju, started to think about all the big, D you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those, D you know, demographics studies that they do that, <swallowing> F um, D you know, have, who knows, how much, D you know, stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere C and <sniffing> I don't know, I don't know how much the stuff actually, what they actually have in there C but I know they use that, E I mean they sell those, <Sniffing> Yeah, that was, that, that was the other one I was thinking of <sniffing>. I think that's, F uh, E I mean I know drugs <noise> are illegal. <Noise> F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Talking> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well <talking> I, I think the, I think that, D you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, D you know, their actions and their behavior C and if they're, D you know, if they're on some kind of, D you know, contol, controlled substance then, D you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, D you know, the supervisor or manager type person, D you know, who is able to evaluate them. I think they should be evaluated that way rather than <sniffing> with a, D you know, a chemical, D you know, <Sniffing> These people that are carriers and don't that don't reveal it? <Sniffing>. <Laughter> Yeah, tha, that would be kind of an extreme. E I mean I've heard of things like, D you know, making them, D you know, marking them somehow or, D you know, or something like that or, D you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of, Yeah. D Wel, I guess it kind of borders on where, E I mean what do you value more. The invasion of, F uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, D you know, other people. Yeah. I guess that's alwa, that's been the big role of government, I guess <laughter>. E I mean generally. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into. I mean that, that particular case. C Because E I mean, there's a lot of people that, F uh, E I mean they could require, D you know, <swallowing> ob, obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because I'm, D you know, there's a huge part of the population, not a huge part C but a, D you know the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do are spreading it. C But, again, to require, D you know, such a test and jus, and then to make, make it is to subject them to, to discrimi, discriminatory practices and other things. I don't know, F uh, I don't know how exactly I feel about that. F Ooh, D well I don't know. What do you think? Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Huh. D Well what about, F uh, required drug testing, F uh, as a, F uh, condition of employment? It thing actually. F Uh, I, F uh, have worked at Texas Instruments. C And, F uh, they instituted a drug policy there. Drug testing policy where they randomly would test, F uh, employees C and D actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about it. I, I hadn't, D you know, it really didn't relate to me. C But there were some things that people brought up like D well what happens if they, they get a false positive, D you know, what recourse do you have. C And, <throat_clearing> also, F uh, F uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity C and yet, F uh, a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's D actually, F oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure. C So <throat_clearing> what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this, although they don't actually e, execute it themselves, it's really the government that. C So, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal. D Well, what about this, F uh, AIDS epidemic now? Where you find that, F uh, F uh, D you know, certain people are actually are, are criminal in their disregard for it, others. Yeah, C and C and, F uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't, it, F uh, it destroys their libido. D Now, F uh, D you know if they ever, C So what about that as an invasion of privacy? C So really, it i, gets to balancing, F uh, personal freedom against, F uh, the general welfare of society. D Well, it, it's supposed to have been. <Throat_clearing> No, it, A growing part. Uhhuh. Maybe chop their weenies off.
