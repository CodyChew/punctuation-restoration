F Uh, what sort of camping do you like to do the most? F Huh, rough type, F huh <laughter>? Okay. F Oh, yeah, motor homes can be a lot of fun. Yeah. F Uh, that can be a lot of fun, too. Yeah. D Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping. This summer we went to, F uh, the Smokey Mountain <noise> National Park. And, F uh, stayed about three or four days in there. It was wonderful. Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable. C And the days were nice and warm C and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days. It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, D what, six months pregnant. C So <laughter>, I don't know, it worked pretty well. It was one of those, F uh, those, dome type pop up tents. Nice and quick and easy to put up. Packs away nice and small C and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto. It was a lot of fun. F Oh, yeah? Wow, that's got to be beautiful territory. Yeah. What, like, Sequoia National Park? F Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Do they still have the, F uh, the scenic, F uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees? Okay. No, so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. D Well, New Orleans and, F uh, Minneapolis. F Oh, yeah. We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. They seem to be trailing out quickly. Yes. I imagine. I would imagine they are. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there? Oh. Place is forested with c, with those concrete trees. Yeah. D Well, I guess that's God's place, too. Anyway, F Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping? Three weeks. Yeah, the whole family, then, was in on this? Yeah. That would have to be a blast. What, D well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area? Yeah. Okay. F Oh, wow. Okay, Big Sur Highway, that's, F uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you? F Uh, D well, I, I do, F uh, real rough type camping. I have a motor home <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. <Laughter> F Uh. Yeah, they really are. They really are. I've, I've enjoyed it. I've never actually done any, F uh, D like tent camping, C but, F uh, one of these days I'm going to try that, too. D Yeah, D like to go visit, F uh, the national parks and state parks and, and, F uh, just get out and see nature. How about you? Uhhuh. F Oh, how great. F Oh, yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. That's great. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that's true, that's true. I guess the last real, F uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago. F Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias. Yeah, it's gorgeous, I love the big trees. Just, just the drive up through, F uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah, I had been there before when I lived in California, C but that's my first trip back in, F oh, goodness, F um, F um, thirty years maybe <laughter>. C But, that is God's country, it has to be. Yeah. F Uh, no, they don't, they, the last one, D well, the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing, C but it has since come down. Yeah. C But, they are huge. If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, D well, there is lots of pretty country further west. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, C and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away. Yeah. Yeah <sniffing>, C because there is lots to see <noise>. There is, course, the <noise> the Grand Canyon C and, F uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, <baby_crying> in a different sort of way. C And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and <breathing>, and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone C and, F uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too. Yeah, Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country. I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now <laughter>. I think it's called a job, I don't know <laughter>. No <laughter>, not around here. Not around here <noise>. Uhhuh, lot, lot of concrete and glass, D you know. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California I took, F uh, three weeks. C And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks. Uhhuh. Everybody <laughter>. Yep. Yeah, it really was, it was great. Uhhuh, yeah. We went, F uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, F uh, F uh, the Grand Canyon, again C and we stopped at, F uh, F uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, F uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast. C And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, F uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, F uh, Sequoia National Park. F Oh, yeah.
