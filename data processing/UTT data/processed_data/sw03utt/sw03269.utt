Real excited when I heard this. So far I've been trying to call all day because <laughter> I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment D so football, I love this. This is great. D Well, we're from Colorado C so we're Bronco fans <baby_crying>. C And, F um, we just moved here two years ago C and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here C and they lost again. That was pretty pitiful, C but they seem to be doing pretty good this year. Oh. <Baby_crying>. Yeah. D Well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year? Two. Yeah. C But they're not doing bad. People are pretty surprised that they, E I mean they beat the Giants. <Laughter>. I bet <laughter> <baby_crying>. F Oh, boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it <laughter>. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, D well, I am, I'm a big football fan. I never wou, my father was a football fan my whole life C and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff C and I just hated it. C And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays. C And, F uh, C so when I met my husband, he was watching football C and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. I couldn't see him until D like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football. C So, Yep. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I do. I just, I love it. It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport. C And, F uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet. We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet. C But, F uh, <Laughter> D Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here <laughter>. That's even harder. C But, No, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. We've only been married for five and a half years. C And, F uh, we have two small children, C and he had a, F uh, just got transferred here to ESystems, <lipsmack> C so. Oh. D Well, I tell you this, the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, D you know, C and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, D you know, there's snow C and it's an adventure <laughter>. C And here, D yeah you've just got to drive down <laughter> to the, to the stadium C and, F uh, Yes. D Well, he's from here. C So, Yeah <laughter>. That's what I hear. Which is rare. Which is good. Yeah. C But, F uh, I, D you know, it's funny in, in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last, I don't know, five <barking> or six years whatever it's been. F Um, they have these songs on the radio. They take moder, popular songs and, and change them to fit, F uh, the Broncos and stuff. C And they had, I was just thinking about one the other day. F Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, F um, C but they did the Johnny Angel. They did Johnny Elway to that. C And, C and I was trying to get my son to sing that. My husband was just having a fit <<trying to sound like her husband>> don't have him sing that song <laughter>. C But, they, they do a lot of fun things. I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. C Because D you know there's just, It's exciting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they probabl, I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, F uh, Te, in Colorado. C Because, F uh, I, I think about that a lot. C But, D you know, when I first moved here was when they, D well, E no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. This interstate seventyfive song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninetyfive and everything. That was kind of a funny song C but they sure do, it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here. Even when they were losing pitifully, D you know, people still support them. We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs, we love the Cowbo, F Oh, yes. D Well, I was from Illinois originally, C and I grew up a Bear fan. C And, F uh, then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans. C And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger Staubach. C And we kind of got spoiled. We expected it to continue forever. I think they're doing pretty well this year though. I think two. I know they lost, D yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia. Yeah, C and wasn't that fun. I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, C and I must say I attracted a lot of attention. People running up saying, F oh, what's the score, what's the score? That's right C and that's exactly what they said, <<trying to sound like a man>> my wife dragged me away from the television. D You know, C but I wasn't, I had forgotten C or I probably wouldn't have been there. Yeah. <Noise>. That's exactly where both of the wives <noise> came from I think. It was, F uh, D you know, it's easier to join them than fight them. C And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football. C And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh yo, did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited <laughter> about, these games. D Well, it takes a little brainwashing first. Yeah. Are you, F uh, transit usually? E I mean do you stay not in one place too long? D Well, it will take you a little while C but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver. F Oh, I know. D Well, if they close it in, D see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing. C But, F uh, Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway. Yeah, that's right, D you know he was one of ours, one of our boys. C So we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Johnny Elway. D Well, there is so much about it to like. D You know it's so exciting. C And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs, C and we all ran out and bought the records, C and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item. Uhhuh.
