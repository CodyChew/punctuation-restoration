<Click> C And you say you have some strong feelings about, F uh, the issue? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I'm a little bit ambivalent. The problem with, F uh, C and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it, F uh, in, in terms of what, F uh, really is driving it. They're not willing to tell the truth. The same way with, F uh, issues of, F uh, race and things like that <throat_clearing>. E I mean right now, F uh, I believe there are two policies that, F uh, that the government uses to modulate immigration. Three actually. One is at the high end, F uh, they always want to be able to, F uh, do some brain draining. They always like to be able to attract the, F uh, Einsteins or the Professor Chou C or, D you know. They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field C and so they can almost always find room for someone like that. At the bottom end, they, F uh, are always willing to, F uh, let in cheap labor <throat_clearing> if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the, powerful people in that area. Those are two things that I think are going on. Although they, I, I don't think the politicians would tell you that. C And then the, third thing is, F uh, the political aspect of, F uh, F uh, letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico <throat_clearing>. They cannot close off the Mexican border. Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be, F uh, F uh, would spill over to this country C so they keep allowing, F uh, the pressure cooker to let off steam. F Uh, <throat_clearing> that's one of the few things I guess <laughter> I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan <throat_clearing>. I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into, F uh, society. They're very difficult, F uh, group to find jobs and, F uh, and, F uh, places for. C And so, F uh, F uh, I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that, F uh, in that they're pretty miserable where they are. C But I'm not to sympathetic about, F uh, letting large numbers of Haitians in. Yeah. Right. C But if you let them, D yeah. If you let them in a million at a time, it wouldn't make that, D you know, it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But po, politically and economically. Yeah, D well I know about it. F Uh, E I mean it's, it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans, F uh, twenty years ago. On the other hand, D you know, <sigh> the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the <laughter> entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant <laughter>. C So there's, F uh, there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in. <Noise>. Right. Sure. <Noise>. Right. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <TV> F Uh, yes I do as far as, F uh, as far as, F uh, as far as immigration as a whole goes. I think that, F uh, we simply must start accepting everybody in the world. F Uh, I, there just is not going to be room for all of us. We don't have jobs now. I, I think, F uh, I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time. F Uh, I hope you're one of the employed right now. I am one of the unemployed right now. I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company C and, F uh, I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings C but they had two thousand applications. C And I know that there are a lot of foreigners, F uh, here, D you know, doing my line of work. C And, of course, I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job. D So, how do you feel? Right <TV>. <Rustling>. <Clicking>. Okay C and I think you're right in both cases. <Clicking>. <Noise> <<sounds like water running>>. <Noise> C And I think probably it's pretty important right there. How do you feel about Haitian immigration? D Actually, D actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here. C And it would have nothing to do with political situations. It would have to do with poverty. F Oh, my gosh. Have you been, have you been to southern Florida? D Well, E I mean C and the two of them together. E I mean we can, it's just as well <laughter> D you know, it's hardly America anymore. C But there's some differences in the immigrants, that, that we're getting now. D Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration. I think, probably your, a great deal of what you say is true about the legals. C But, F uh, the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now, they do not come here to blend into America. F Uh, they, they don't bother to learn our language C and, F uh, first of all, th, they, E I'm sorry, this, I really feel strongly about this. We send a lot of money to Mexico.
