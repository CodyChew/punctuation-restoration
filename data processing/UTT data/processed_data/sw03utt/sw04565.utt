<Music> I, D you know, D actually in this modern day and age, it seems like, F uh, F uh, we have more and more leisure time because, F uh, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot. We don't even have to cook dinner anymore. F Uh, C but I, F uh, I've heard, A I don't know this for a fact, C but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together. That ki, the kids maybe on the average get, F uh, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents. It seems bizarre to me. I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the, the worst thing that's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television. <Throat_clearing> Not so much because, F uh, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming C and I thin, there's also some, F uh, I think, F uh, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time. It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. C So I refuse to have one in the house. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well I'll tell you. Television sure makes child rearing easy on you. E I mean the kids can be a real pest, F uh, C and turning the T V on is almost like magic, D you know, it's like sticking, F uh, an electrode into their pleasure center C and you don't have to worry about them. C But I don't think it's too good. F Uh, C so, D you know, I don't know, I take advantage, I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids, C but I take advantage of, F um, dinner time. We always eat together C and, D you know, whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them. F Uh, I guess our big outlet is music. F Uh our thirteen year old son plays violin C and our, nine year old daughter plays cello C and, F uh, when our son started playing violin, I took up violin C and when our daughter started playing cello, I took up cello. C So there's plenty of, plenty of interactive time in, F uh, practicing. Although neither kid likes to practice. I guess that's not a big surprise. C But I mea, I imagine with infants you <throat_clearing> are, most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although, F Oh, D you know, reading is so good. I, F uh, I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little C and I still try to read to them, although our son is not liking that anymore. F Uh, C but I read, D you know there's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book. Have you ever seen that yet? Yeah, it's called a sleep book C and, F uh, you ought to get it. I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized. F Uh, Yeah. D Well, I think, I think his sleep book is my favorite. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day? F Oh that's great. F Oh, I see. Ho, how old are your kids again? Two and one. Yeah, C so you have your hands full with them, that's for sure <music>. <TV> Yes. Yeah, really. <Sniffing>. That's what I've heard too. F Uh, Yeah. Right. I know it. I've, I tell myself sometimes, just sit down after work, F Oh really? D Well good for you. Good for you. A lot of people, I talk to a lot of people about that C and I've thought about it myself C and I though about it a lot <laughter>. C But, F uh, I still haven't done it yet. D Well that's good. That's true I've noticed that. I don't think so either. Do you keep your kids, F uh, active in sports or anything C or, F Oh, okay. <Child>. Okay. <Child>. <Laughter>. No. Not for kids <laughter>. Yeah. D Well I, I try and read to them C and I take them to the park and stuff C and, Yeah. Yeah. D Well, they get to that stage. Sleep book, no. <Laughter>. We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books. F Oh, really? D Well, yeah I like to, I like to do it C and they enjoy reading. I've, D actually I never read a lot growing up C and I never read until a few years ago I just started picking up books C and so I've found that, D you know, it's really important to me to get to read. To, I like to get away in a book, D you know? C And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids to try and, F Oh, I probably spend an hour or two. My wife works at night, C so she does, F uh, Tupperware, C so she's gone a lot at nights C and so I spend a lot of time with them <sniffing>. They're two and one. Uhhuh. Yeah <TV>.
