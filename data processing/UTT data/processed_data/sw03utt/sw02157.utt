Okay. Who do you think? <laughter> The Dallas Cowboys. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, they're going to get better. E I mean, D you know. Yeah. As long as Troy Ot, Aikman doesn't get hurt again. That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year. D So, I don't, I don't even know who your favorite team is, D actually. Okay. I think I did know that, I just forgot. Okay. Yeah. Has Herschel Walker done much for them? Definitely. D Well, he was a good player. I guess, D well I don't know, he just never, I don't know, for a while there, D Well, he could always get past, D you know, he'd get past D like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. C But, F um, I guess you never could really see him play, because with the Cowboys, while he was with the team, the rest of the team was pretty poor C so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team C and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team. C But, I don't know. Emmett Smith, yeah. N, he's been doing real good. I'm pretty impressed with him so far. Did he, did he actually play in the Pro Bowl. I remember he was D like a backup C and then somebody got injured C and he was supposed to go. Yeah, I kind of, I haven't been keeping up with football, E I mean, in the fall I, I can go on and on about football, C but since it's kind of off season, it's kind of hard to think back about all that. C But, F uh, <laughter> <<pause>>, Yeah. F Um, I have no idea. No earthly idea. How did they end up this year? Did they, did they make it to the playoffs at all? Uhhuh. Kind of like the cowboys, F huh. Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing <throat_clearing>. I don't know about the Vikings <laughter>. Just hadn't heard much about them lately. Yeah. D Well, the Cardinals, I don't know. I think the Cowboys probably have a, a better team. They just, at the end of the season, the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt, because, F uh, Laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all. Of course, he sat along the sidelines all season, he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot. D Well, I'm just saying I shouldn't, I shouldn't blast him like that, say, F oh D well, Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them, E I mean, he didn't get to see much action. But, too bad. C Because now, now, D you know, he had a shot and, and didn't look too good C and so, no one's going to have much faith in him any more. In fact, I think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback. I haven't, F uh, I haven't kept up with it lately, C but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on, or, or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody, C but it wasn't anybody I'd really heard of. C But I heard on the radio this morning, or yesterday morning, that, F uh, Aikman's back in practicing, doing real, real well. F Um, who is it, Michael Irvin he said that, F uh, Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time. C So, sounds like he's going to be all right for next season. They're just trying not to overwork him right now, until he gets his shoulder, F uh, back in shap, it was his shoulder, wasn't it, <laughter> that he had the problems with? I think it, I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on. C But anyway, they're trying to keep him, D you know, keep him, F uh, from reinjuring anything, but anyway <laughter>. Thirty day notice for what? F Oh, really. What. <laughter> F Oh, okay, maybe I'll call you back after, after the recording is finished. D Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes. I can't remember. Really. I usually have, too. Yeah, I've done that once or twice. I didn't look at the clock when we started talking, C so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in. Yeah. D So other than the Vikings, who do you like? F Uh, oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Back when they were in Saint Louis? <Laughter> Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, F uh, all that impressive, I guess. I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan. Other than that, E I mean, D you know, when I've, D you know, when you grow up in a city that has the, D you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it. Yeah. Yeah, E I mean it, it was really exciting, growing up when, when the Cowboys were really big. C Because my parents would always have season tickets, C and they'd go to all the games, C and D you know, the hype were just unbelievable. It's just, D you know, the last, F oh I guess probably since about eightyfour, about eightyfive was when they started kind of going downhill really, C but, D you know, I'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys, and, D you know, Super Bowl, and all this other stuff. C So, I can't, D you know, I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. E I mean, I think they'll pull out of it, C and, D you know, they'll, they'll wind up being good again. They've got some, lot of really good young players that are going to, that are going to, F uh, do pretty good, I think. <<pause>> C But, they're raising prices on their tickets. C So they're banking on doing good next season. I think tickets are, Yeah. Thirty, or thirtytwo for really good tickets. D See, they, they sectioned it out even more. They used to just have D like, F uh, first of all it was all one price. C And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. C And now they're sectioning it off to D like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one, just on the lower levels is the highest price, C and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level, C and then D like from the twenty to the ten yard line. C And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas, C and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end, the direct end zones. C But, F um, they have about four or five different prices now, that they're structuring it with, C but obviously D yeah, they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do. F Um, D you know, I'm not sure, I'm not positive, I didn't, I didn't really think about that. I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section <laughter> but in the little bit cheaper. C But, not that I'll ever go. I hadn't been to a Cowboys game, las, time, last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that, F um, N F L strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there, C and it was the, F uh, Dallas and Washington Redskins game. C And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets, C and they, F um, if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else. C So my dad, I went with my dad to a game that one time. C But that wasn't a real, D you know, it was, it was the scab teams, it was kind of, D you know, it was kind of different, I guess. C And before that it's been quite a few years. I've been wanting to go to a game, I just never, never have gotten around to it. C So maybe this year <static>. Oh. D So, who's your, F uh, favorite team? The Dallas Cowgirls, F huh. D Well, <throat_clearing> they did have a fairly decent year finally this year. At least they're coming around. D Well E I mean, D you know, I think, F uh, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, F uh, they'll do all right. Uhhuh. I'm a Viking fan. C And they haven't been doing too hot, C so. No, in fact, in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal. <Throat_clearing> I've never been over impressed with him. D Well, who's the running, is it Sammy Smith, C or is it, Emmett Smith. Emmett Smith. Yeah. I'm not sure. Who else is, F uh, F oh there's, D you know, Mike, Minnesota Vikings, used to be the general manager starting the World Football League. C So, C and th, C and he was trying to keep, F uh, F uh, <<pause>> I can't even think of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings. Bu, Jerry Burns. Goin, ke, <throat_clearing> he was going to keep him as the coach somehow, C but, F uh, I don't know, I'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow. D Well, they started out really bad, they went D like one and six, C and then they won five or six in a row. C So they were in a shot to make the playoffs C and they screwed up the last couple of games. Yeah, I guess you can, Yeah. C And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb, in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys, C and the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season, C and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys, C so. F Oh, don't made any excuses for him <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I don't know <throat_clearing>. Yeah I think it was. C But, F uh, D well I got my thirty day notice yesterday. F Um, I'm done, where I work. D So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that, C but I just thought I'd throw that in there <laughter>. F Oh, w, I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this. They always say you've talked your ten minute limit. Make sure we get our cash flow. <Laughter>. F Um, D actually, when I was younger, I was a Cardinal fan, too. Remember Jim Hart? Jim Hart was playing. Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals. This was a long time ago. F Um, <<pause>> I don't know who else I've ever. That's about it, I was always a Viking fan. I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit C and, Yes, F oh, of course. Yeah, D well, the Cowboys were th, America's football team, there's no question about that, C so. <Throat_clearing>. Again. What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something? C So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year. That's interesting, I almost lost our electricity here.
