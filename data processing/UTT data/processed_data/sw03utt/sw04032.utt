Okay, Martin, do you do any exercise? Uhhuh. F Um, C so those are more or less indoor sports. How's the weather out there in Georgia? Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, I'm on a exercise program. I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, F um half an hour every morning, C and I'm just about ready to up it to up to fortyfive minutes a morning, C and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time. It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and, F um, has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise. No, huhuh. I, first of all I'd like to get my weight off. I'm about fifty pounds overweight, C and so I'd like to get the weight off, C and then I'd really like to get into that. C And, F uh, we have a, my husband and I have a, a, aerobic video that's called The Firm. I don't know if you've heard of it, C but it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down, C but you're using weights, C and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done. It's it's really fun. Yes, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. F Um, no, E I mean, yes, I am, C but I have never done it myself. Have you done that? Oh. That's the big thing, F huh? Oh. C So how is that? Oh. <Laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Now, if, F um, playing basketball, are you knees, do you have healthy knees? F Oh, dear <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's good. D Well that sounds, you sound just like my husband. He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball, C and, F oh, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy. C So that's what he does, he wears his, his brace and his high tops C and, Oh. Oh,. Wow <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, dear. <laughter> Oh. It is amazing how fast you take off the inches C and I would, once I start my forty, I'd like to do the fortyfive minutes a day on the bike for a week, C and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day. C But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off, C and the muscle builds real fast. F Um, you can start, they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month C and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, F uh, twentyfive pound dumbbells C and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video C and it's a hour long video, C so. It is, yeah, I really enjoy that, C so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy <laughter>. Yes. Yes. Now this one has been quite mild. F Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground. It was quite chilly C but not, Yes, I do. F Uh, I like to, F uh, play basketball and weight lifting. Those are probably the two main things I like to do. Yeah. F Um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis. F Um, I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring, fall, C but in the winter it gets pretty cold. F Um, yeah, C so it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter. F Um, how about yourself? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Do you do, F uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise? Uhhuh. F Huh. Yes, it's, it's, it's aero, it's similar to aerobics with weights C but it's like low impact aerobics, just with weights. Okay, are you familiar with, F um, step or bench aerobics? F Uh, yes, I have. In, in Atlanta that's, F um, most of the health clubs are all, that's the, that's the in thing. At first it was just regular aerobics, C but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over. F Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics, C and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time. C And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good <laughter> workout. C But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees D you know, that and movement of going up on the step D you know, that could create a problem. They, they seem to think that it, it won't, C but you never know. Yeah, I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point. C But, I've, I've kind of taken care of that. I wear high tops and then also an an, a support ankle brace which is very stiff C and, F um, we, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so. Yeah. Yeah, I. Uhhuh. Yeah, I did, I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy. E I mean, it would only take three or four days C and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way. C But, F um, C so how, how successful is your exercise video? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So it's a good workout. Uhhuh. C So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of, it's quite cold and snow.
