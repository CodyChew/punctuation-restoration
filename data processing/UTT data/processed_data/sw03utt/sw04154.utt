D Well what do you feel about the, F um, present situation in the Mideast? Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> Yeah, I agree. I think, I think there's definitely been some changes, F um, C and I think D you know, the, the, F um, end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on, on the situation. F Um, D you know, in that there's, there's not, D you kno, there, D you know, i, D you know, basically since the end of World War two there was always, D you know, that little proxy war going on. D You know, with, F um, the U S funding Israel and, and the, F um, Soviet Union funding the Arab countries. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but on the same token, D you know, Israel has lost a lot of their, D you know, value to the U S in being, D you know, the foothold of capitalism. D You know in, in the Mideast. Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <lipsmack> Yeah, C but on the other hand, D you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the, D you know, they, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. They basically would have, D you know, had a, had a f, they had, they would have had, had to fly through, D you know, two enemies. The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them. E I mean, of course, D you know, public statements can be taken for, <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. D, Uhhuh. <lipsmack> D You know, <breathing> D well, to begin with, D you know, I pretty much question or what, what the U S s motives were in, F uh, in, in actually the original involvement. F Uh, <lipsmack> I, the cynical side of me says that, D you know, it was more for, F uh, the, the domestic political situation than for anything else. D You know, and that, D you know, and for portraying Bush is a strong President. F Uh, E I mean I really, I really think that, that, my gut feeling is that, that, D you know, he pretty much picked, picked the fight with, F uh, with, F um, Hussein. E I mean I'm not, not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge, enter that fight. C But, D you know, I think, I think that, that, F um, we chose to have our official feelings hurt. Where a lot w, <Gasp>. I think, E I mean I thought, I think that, F um, in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen. C And I, I really don't, I really don't think that, I think, I think it was, it was, there were, there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests. F Um, Yeah. C And E I mean in, in, in along this line since, since, D you know it, it really, it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting, getting, F uh, the Iraqis out of Kuwait. I just don't, I just don't, I, I, I d, I, I, I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and, D you know, in, in fighting a second battle. F Um, D you know, over, over the, F uh, over, over what, what probably won't accomplish him, accomplish much for him politically. Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. <Breathing>. <Lipsmack>. D Well, I have, I have very fixed feelings about Israel. F Um, I think that, that for a long while we've, we've had almost a, D you know, ha, t, D Well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is. What do you think, Mark? F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. C And then we'll see what happens when, F uh, they're not funded quite as much. Or supplied with arms the same way. Uhhuh. D Well, I, we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves, D you know, we s, kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them. C But, I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was, D you know, during the war, F uh, in, F uh, Kuwait was, F uh, the fact that they did not retaliate, for the, F uh, scud missiles that were, F uh, launched there. That just seemed to me to be a, F uh, a phenomenal, F uh, demonstration of restraint, C and it must have reflected, F uh, F uh, some awful good, F uh, diplomacy on the part of the U S. I see. F Oh, you don't think they got the codes from the U S already? I see. That's true. <laughter> They can, yet they, Yeah. D Well what do y, what about this situation with the, D you know, the, F uh, continual, F uh, harassment by Iraq right now and, F uh, apparently failing to let the, F uh, arms inspectors have free access. Uhhuh. F Huh, yeah, okay. Sure. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, do you think that, F uh, we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and, F uh, D you know, move on into Kuwait and see what happens? Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, D well may have been. D You know, I'm not saying that that's not the case. F Uh, Right. No. No, it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do, to do much more in there. Even at this point. Yeah. D Well what about, F uh, do you have any, any views on, F uh, Israel's relation to the U S? Do you, think we ought to, D you know, back off on our support of the country C or what do yo,
