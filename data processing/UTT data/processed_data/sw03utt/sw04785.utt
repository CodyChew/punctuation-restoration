Yeah <laughter>.. D Well, twentyseven up. C And we had five. F Oh, yeah. C And how about yourself? Oh. D well. Yeah. D Well, when mine were growing up, I did some traveling and but not that extensively C but I always just made it a point, D you know, to spend about ten minutes with each one of them. C So it was an hour, D you know. C But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them. <Laughter> Six years. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. We look back and wonder how we did it. No, she never did. . D Well, yeah, yeah. Yeah. D Well that's plenty though. Yeah. Right. D Well, D you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house. <Laughter> C And, D you know it, it's tough to find time. E, espec, especially with both of them working. C And you just have to set the time and say, okay this is going to be it. Right. Right. D Well that's good too. Yeah, that's good that way too <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, that, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes a day. C And, D you know, C and as the kids got older I made them, D you know, help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever C and, F Oh, yeah. C And, F uh, D well, yeah, if, <Laughter> Yeah. Just keep them talking that way. C But, F uh, another thing we used to do is have ham, family councils. Every Sunday night. <Cough> Discuss everything that didn't agree with them. C And we'd take turns being president. C And everyone would get one vote. C And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two C but it never worked that way. Yeah. D Well C and we could bring up C and we could bring up stuff too. C And that was always good time. D Boy, we really got to know the kids well. F Oh, yeah. In fact, they were all in, F uh, over the weekend for Easter. D Well, we did too. C And I remember the one daughter saying, we had a, a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree C and she said, D hey I don't make fun <<mispronounced>>, fun of your friends C so why make fun of mine? Kind of r, kind of hit us between the eyes. No. C But that, that was always good quality time for us. C And then never attend, C but if, if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules. Yeah C and boy, they, they'd show up. C And we'd usually take notes C and, D you know, the younger kids, F uh, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another. C And, F uh, C but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us. C And they loved it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C But, F uh, boy, I, I feel for you and your husband. D Well, my, my, F uh, two of my, F uh, kids too? F Oh, you laugh. How many, what ages? <laughter>. F Uh. You've been through the fun part <laughter>. <Laughter>. I have a four and a half and a three. C So. It's, I, I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way it's done now and then. Yeah. Yeah. What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest? C So they were all real close? That's tough. That's a lot of time. Did you both work? Your wife too? F Uh, D well, qualify that. She worked at home, I'm sure <laughter>. C But that's, F uh, D well both my husband and I work C and sometimes I feel like, D you know, by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed, I have very little time each evening. Maybe thirty minutes max. C And D well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking C and then I spend time with them while, D you know, he's doing other stuff. C And, C and, of course, we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend. D You know, there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it C but it's neat, it's straight C and I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids, D you know. D Well, I've accepted that too <laughter>. That's true. It is. Yeah. That's true. D Well, that's true C and, C and we do a lot of that on the weekends, D you know. We try to spend Saturdays together. If my husband golfs, D you know, he'll do it during nap time, things like that where they're not really missing the presence, D you know. C And, C and we do a lot of family things together. We're, we're kind of going the other direction this weekend. We're planning a trip, just he and I. This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago. D Well, I decided that, D you know, you need that once in awhile. That you, you need to plan the quality time C and, C and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twentyfour hours a day. Yeah. Sure. Sure. C And they think that's a family activity, D you know. Yeah. That's great fun <laughter>. My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the laundry? Of course, you can <laughter>. Absolutely. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. C And what would you do, what? Oh. Yeah. C So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week C and then, Oh. I imagine. C And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them. I, F Oh, that's wonderful. D See I was raised in that type of family where, D you know, you don't disobey me, you mind me C but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it, you can always come back and talk to me about it. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh D well. Yeah, yeah. You don't think of it that way do you <laughter>. Now that's good. I like that idea. Whatever was voted on, F huh. D Well I think that's great. Yeah. Yeah. I, I think that's true. I can remember times my parents would say D well what do you think would be a fair punishment. C And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done D you know. C So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves, D you know. F Oh, why is that?
