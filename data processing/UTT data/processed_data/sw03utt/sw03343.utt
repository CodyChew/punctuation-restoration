Okay. When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank. I thought, D Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Of course, <laughter> uhhuh. Right right, just to get you by five years C and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure. Right. Right. C And you usually get what you pay for. We bought some walkietalkies a couple of years ago for Christmas, C and they were D like ten dollars, C and we expected them <laughter> to work nice for the little kids, C and they didn't work worth anything <laughter>. D So we took those back, C and that's about that all that <laughter> were taken back in ages. Yeah. Right. Right. F Oh, really. It's hard. F Oh, wow. Uhhuh, C and it just pertained to that <laughter>. <Laughter> I, at first I thought of food, D you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy, it seems like, C and, F uh, D you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there, C but, C But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one, C so. Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, C so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, C and C and that has saved us <laughter> thousands of dollars, D you know, from to mechanic to anything like that C but, C but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, I, it's hard to say. Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, D you know, makes things break easier, C but I think the technology is better. About quality. Right. Yeah, Yeah. Right. D Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, D so, D you know, for a handcrafted something, C so C so. C So, if we get what we <laughter> what we deserve <laughter>. D Well, I haven't either, F uh, I, I hate returning things. E I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, D you know, take everything back again <laughter>. It's, D you know, it's a game to her, C but I, I do not like to do that <laughter>. I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time. C And so I'm usually, F uh, pretty careful when I shop C and I also, D you know, usually have, have checked over things, D you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, F uh, it has the features in it that I want. <Child_whining> Now we've had one lately, F um, F oh, a, F uh, a <child_whining> Dustbuster Plus that we bought, C and we've had it for a while, C but all of a sudden it just wasn't working, C and it looks like there's a part missing from it. My husband opened it up and whatever, C and of course we don't have the receipt any more, C so we can't take it back <laughter>. F Uh, C but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long F uh, Yeah. D Well, that's true, C and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost <breathing> are just as well off buying another one D you know, if it's, Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name F uh, D you know, if it's a, a good brand, I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, F uh, I think more often than not, you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time, C and, F uh D you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, D you know, too much of a problem with it, E I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do. We never could get it <laughter> declared a lemon, C and the car would go C and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty C and it would stop C and I, there was just, D you know, C and, F oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything, C and they got it finally semifixed, C but it was such a hassle yeah, yeah it, it really is, F uh, C but, gee, <laughter> this is, of all the topics I have had, A I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one. Uhhuh. D Well, I think that's true, C and I, F uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, D you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Ye, I think technology is better, I'm, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better F uh, D you know, I, I, everything is so automated, F uh, C and things can be made without, <laughter> I think a human hand ever touching it, D you know an awful lot of things, C and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, D you know, had some pride in it. D Well, yeah, that's that's true. Yeah, D well, I, I do, F uh, D you know, craft work and sell <child_crying> stuff at shows C and that, C and F uh, F uh, D you know, it's, it's, it's a real eyeopener as far as, D you know, why people charge what they do to, D you know.
