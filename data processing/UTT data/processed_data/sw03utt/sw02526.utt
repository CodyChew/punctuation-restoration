Okay, what kind of car are you thinking about buying next? What year? F Oh, okay. D Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic, C and I'm ready to get rid of it <laughter>. D Actually, No, F uh, D well, I ha, I had an eightyeight that I really liked C and it got wrecked, C and so I bought a ninety, F um, because I, I really liked my eightyeight C and I've had a lot of problems with this one, <laughter> C so, D Well, you, it's, it's kind of funny, F um, I know a lot, Oh. Yeah. It's, it's true, it's definitely true because, Yeah, D well, Honda does too <laughter>, that's why I was really, Uhhuh. Yeah. That's true. That's true. No, not at all. F Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, <laughter>, because I had, F uh, F uh, F uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda, C and it was the worst car I've ever owned <laughter>, C and, F um, that's why, E I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda it was just a wonderful car C and then it got wrecked C and, D you know, I wouldn't even look at another car <laughter>, I just went and bought a Honda, E I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want, <laughter>, C and I really have had a lot of problems with it, <laughter> C but I don't know. <Laughter> D Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty C but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month, <laughter>, it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months <laughter>. Yeah, it was, I was really disappointed because I was, D you know, so, hyped up on Honda, C so. Yeah. D Well, I know this, D Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange, <laughter>, C but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van, <laughter>, I really like those C and I have kids, <laughter> C so. They're a lot, I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van, and the, the new Chevy Lumina van, I don't like those styles, F um, the M P V is more of, F uh, F uh, just, F uh, A I don't know what you, normal, <laughter>, I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type. I, I'm not sure how to explain it, E I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, F uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow, no, what Astro, Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that, C but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think, Yeah, I have a couple kids <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, <laughter>, definitely. C But, I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning, <laughter>, I'm sure you can, F uh, relate to air conditioning <laughter>. F Um, living in Arizona, C but, C and cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it, <laughter>. E I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, really? Sports car <laughter>. I'd like to have a sports car too, C but it's not practical for me, <laughter> C but, Yeah. Whoops. There's some kind of problems. Hello, are you still there? This is, something's wrong. I don't know, it sounds funny though, doesn't it? F Huh. F Oh, at least, yeah, I know, D well, new cars aren't cheap anyway, <laughter> C but, F Huh. <Laughter> Yeah, we have, we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we? <Laughter> What I'd really like to have <laughter>, Yeah. This is strange. Hello, I think, something's wrong with this. I hope it's recording <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, you're right <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, those are nice, yeah, they're, they're cute cars <laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. D Wow, I haven't seen those. Wow. F Oh, yeah, definitely. If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a limited edition, it's usually worth something later on. Yeah. Oh. Really? D Now, D see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that <laughter> for something that's limited edition. C And, D well, they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they? Yeah. That's true. Uhhuh. F Huh. F Huh. Yeah, it really is. Have you seen the new, F uh, Dodge Stealth? The, the, real nice one <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too, D now those are nice <laughter>. Right. Right. The expensive ones, they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand, C but those are pretty stripped, C and there's nothing, there's really, that one's just more for looks, D you know, it doesn't have any, really the performance that the expensive one does. D You know, C but I've seen one of those, C and it's not that great, E I mean, because they really, Yeah, the, D like, E I mean they have, F um, better, it's not quite as nice for a little bit less. Yeah, they're not really that bad C but I don't know, <laughter> like I said it's, it's still not practical for me <laughter>. I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that <laughter>. Right. F Oh, really? F uh... D Well, what a wh, what do we currently have, I have a Subaru, F uh, G O X T. Eightyeight. F Oh, it's not pretty old. D So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of? D Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, F uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together, C so. C But, C but that's one reason I, F uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru, that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, F uh, for, D you know, low maintenance, C so. D Well, really, there's, there's no question C but you have a nineteen, E I mean, I've got to see if, E I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, F uh, D like, F uh, eightyone or eighty, F uh, Celicas, C and those things just keep ticking. E I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them, C and they're still beating on them, C and it's just amazing C and then they got, C and D you know they're not making them like that now, d, d, D you know, D so, C but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el, <laughter>. Yeah, that's a lot. F Oh, well. Anyway, C so, what's your next purchase supposed to be? F Oh, really, if you had a choice of your car, what would you get? I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, okay, yeah. Do you have, F uh, do you have a family? Okay, D well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, D well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college C and, F uh, D you know, I always been looking for something sporty C and I ended up getting, D you know, basically something that I could, D you know, afford. The only gripe I have is performance. I probably, F uh, a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, F uh, D like Mazda R X seven's and stuff C and they're, they're pretty fun to drive, C so, C so, I think that's what, F uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around, I keep, I keep hold, holding off C and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to C but I just, I, it's just such a huge expense C and, C and, F uh, I, I'm just going to keep holding off C but I'm definitely going to look for something, F uh, in the, D you know, nice, perpor, D you know, Yeah <noise>. I'm in, are you still there? <Noise> Hello. Okay. Wonder what happened. F Huh, anyway, F um, C but I'll probably, F um, it just depends, I know that's what I want, C but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money, you're looking at, D you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something, you're looking at twentyfive K or something, <<Very faint>> that like C and so, anyway C but, Anyway my ultimate car though, the, the one that I really want is, F uh, five sixty or so, Mercedes, C so, maybe someday <laughter>. Yeah. That's the only one that I, D you know, I se, D you know, I see, F uh, D you know, early on that, that, that says, <noise>, it says, you there? <Noise> Hello. Okay. I hope it's not my, <noise>, you there? It may be my phone, F um, anyway it's the only car that says, D you know, sporty and class, F uh, C so, F uh, kind of what I'm, C but it's, at the other one my brother's got a Miata C and those are fun. C And, F uh, i, Yeah, D well, he did, he had a, a red <beep> Miata, C and, F uh, he actually, they came out with a European racing, green, F uh, Miata that's a limited edition, they're only going to make D like three or four thousand. C So, he went out C and he traded the other one in and got this one, C and I'm like, F um, C but, F uh, I haven't seen one yet either C but supposedly they have some real wood built in to D like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel, C so, it's, it's very authentic C and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be, may be a good investment. If it, Yeah. Uhhuh. C But, F uh, I think <noise> hello, okay, yeah, I got off my pace or my cordless phone, D anyway, F uh, hope it's not going bad, <<very faint>>, it's going to bump me out. F Um, C but he, I think he, he only spent, D you know, the low twenty's C so, I don't know. D Well, I don't know, I think the demands gone all, down a little bit. I think you can, the prices aren't as high, D you know, C and the, the mu, Miata was first introduced, F uh, Wh, yeah, the demand is so, high that, F uh, D you know, they were going to retail them around D like thir, D you know, thirteen standard, D you know, C and you get your options, your looking at fifteen or si, fifteen C but there were, D you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty, C and, F um, they, they may have gone down a little bit C but I, they're still pretty much in demand. I think there's another car coming in, it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata, C and I can't remember what I read about that C but so, that's, E I mean, I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular, C so. C But, F Oh, yeah. yeah, C and the Mitsubishi, three thousand G T, is the same, same. Yeah, D well, that's, that's, that's the same manufacturer C and st, C so, they just market them. C But, F uh, yeah, those are C and those are supposed to be very performance power, E I mean, they're, there is, D yeah, big time. Yeah. I think the, they're only around, F uh, twentynine K. Yeah. Yeah, I'm being single C and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess, D you know, it's, I can, I can, I've been pretty happy, I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now, that's, F uh, D you know, I could, I could have, D you know, get something nice and upgrade C but I just, F uh, I'm consulting right now, C so, I just made my first job hop about eight months ago, C so.
