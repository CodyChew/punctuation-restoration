Okay? D Well, this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend. Yeah. Down at Lake Texoma lodge. Yes, this is one that's, F uh, the Baker family reunion C and this has been going on at least, F uh, A I would say, at least twentyfive years or thirty, something like that. Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime. First time, I, I married into the family, C and the first time I went was about fiftyseven, I think. C But, F uh, this one has been well organized C and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood, C and now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to. Very important, because, F uh, you'll start losing people if it's too far to go. Yeah. Never get them at both places, Right. D Well, listen, they've, F uh, they've had this one, D well it just, of course, over the years it has, F uh, built up as far as the organization is concerned C but now they, F uh, have a golf tournament on the Saturday. C And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such. Yeah, C and, F uh, everyone, F uh, they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge, C and everyone brings in food C and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in D like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant, C and F uh it really, F uh, has worked out. F Uh, generally, F uh, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people. I think normal's about sixty or seventy. Oh <laughter>. Oh. Yeah. Right. Yeah, D well, our family start, reunion started out my wife C and I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak C and now we go, our children go, C and our grandchildren are going now. C So it's, F uh, wound up that, F uh, we're the old folks now. C But, F um, they have various organized, they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, F uh, to pitch, C and they organize a baseball game for the kids C and several people bring boats, C and there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon, C so it it's a full day. Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend, C and some just come in for Saturday C so, it, F uh, has worked out quite well, C and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year. Yeah, my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia, C and I think we've been to one in thirtyfive years <laughter> or something like that, C so, That's just too far away. Yeah. It's an, all day drive just to get to this area. <Sneezing>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have, each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion C and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president. We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together. C And it takes a lot of planning, and assembling of stuff. Right. That's correct. Yes, it is, I tell you. <Laughter> I don't really care for her to be president again. <Laughter> C But that is, F uh, it's, it's a lot of work, C but it's a lot of fun. We've enjoyed it, C and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma. Yeah, C and this year they're all excited. The show this weekend, this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are, are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song D you know, in jeans and tshirts and such. C So, it's, F uh, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too. F Oh, yes, there have been some really wild shows put on there. They, F uh, really get, F uh, into it. Yeah, D well, F Oh, that generally happens. Yeah. Yeah, D well we've, F uh, had various things over the years, F uh, to raise funds for it C and again, it's not, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such, C but, F uh they've come up with, they've tried passing the hat, C and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds, C and, F uh some people do C and some people don't <laughter>. <Cough> E Excuse me. C But, F um, anyway, that's the family reunion story. Okay. Been nice talking to you. Bye. Yes. F Oh are you really? Where is it going to be? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's marvelous. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be. Uhhuh. We have factions, when it's one part, we, I have one reunion on my mother's side, C and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas, some people come, C and if it's elsewhere, other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like, C so I think we need to find a new place <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, that's a neat idea. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. How many people, Jim, are involved? Wow. Yeah, D well, I guess, F um, ours probably isn't that big. Our family is dwindling, for one thing. C And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died I just have one aunt and my family. C So sometimes when these other families get together, they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids, C and we're kind of off on the sidelines. C But it does remind us that we have family and roots. C So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it. Uhhuh. F Oh that's great. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So there's lots to do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh that's true. D Well, that's neat. I think, think they're really fun. We go to mine regularly, C and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple, C and he has a large family, C so it's, it's fun when we go to that one. Oh. Yeah, yeah that, that is a problem with the distance. The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way C and it's just too much for all of them, all of that group to travel. Right. C But then we have the same attitude when it's out, there, although this year we're going out. They're going to have it at Fort Davis C and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. And choose, some place that everybody's going to like as far as food and all that <laughter>. That's a heavy burden. <Laughter>. No <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I think, Yeah, C and it's, it's good for kids to know that they have other family. F Oh, boy. F Oh, what fun. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Probably lots of laughs. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along. Ours, ours is still kind of loosely organized, C and the same people usually get stuck with doing it. C And, they do it as a labor of love. C So, the officer idea is a good idea. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and it's not fair that everybody not contribute, Uhhuh. D Well, thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you. Bye.
