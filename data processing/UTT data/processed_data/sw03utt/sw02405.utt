Hi, how are you today? Good. D Well as a matter of fact I'm, before we started this conversation I was working on my P C at home. Do you have one? Yeah. Do you have, We have an, F um, D actually it's a T I computer, C but it is the I B M F um, clone. It's not the T I P C from back when. Right. Yeah, that's what we have. F Um. D Well, I really do. I, F um, am an accountant C and, C but I work at home. C So I use it for that quite often. We have, D you know, used some of it for some personal things. We keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it. I, since it's tax season, I'm doing a lot of taxes, C so I do a lot of, F um, a lot of that work on it as well. Uhhuh. F Oh it is. Yeah, you can. Yes, you can, that's right. We really, we deci, we didn't decide to get one until I started working at home. Then, D you know, then, we thought, D well we can use it for, D you know, some personal things. We di, for us it really took, D you know, a business application to justify the expense of it. Really. Right. She could just as easily do those things by hand. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh my gosh. Right. Right. C And D you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make. Right <Child>. I, I think in most cases I'd have to say no. Not unless somebody really enjoys it. Or perhaps is using it for education. I have a four year old son, C and we have some education programs that he likes. A little Sesame Street one C and we have another one that plays music, C and he really likes that one. That's right. C And yeah, on, now I think about it, I guess for, for kids D like, as they get older, especially now when they get to junior high school, high school, and even college. E I mean, my sister went to college, started about three years ago, <child> C and she had to have a, a computer. E I mean, it was like a necessity. She couldn't imagine going through college without a computer. Right. Yeah, any more I don't even know if they have, if a college kid would have a typewriter <laughter>. Probably not even, no. Uhhuh. D Well, D unfortunately in our family, my husband and I went through college together C and then he went on and got his Master's degree while I was working. C And I'm the better typist, of us, C and we just had a regular old typewriter, not even a correcting one back then. It wasn't that long ago, C but I typed his Master's papers and things on a typewriter. F Oh boy, to have a computer back then. At least. E I mean, C and then of course you have some changes to make, and do the whole thing over. You take out a sentence, on a computer you take it out, D bleep, print it out, fine. Take out a sentence on a piece of paper, Right. F Oh, yeah. The first time. That's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about, because people do feel like, F Oh D well, we can just change it. Yeah, use it as a, just a, Right. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. I believe it. Uhhuh. D Well, it's good that she does that, E I mean, bring it to people's attention. <Laughter>. Right, F Oh I have to, Especially when they're in school, I think they would get a lot out of it. Uhhuh. Ooh. Ooh, that still could add up. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, you too. Have a nice day. Byebye. I'm great <laughter>. Yeah. No, I don't have one at home. I work with one on, at work continually, D you know, C but I do not have one of my own at home. What do you have, at home? Uhhuh. Right. From the oldies but the goodies. It's probably pretty close to what I have, because I have the same kind of thing at work. I have a three eightysix S X which is T I computer, C but everything in, is in I B M mode. C So. Do you use it a lot at home? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So you're on it a lot. Uhhuh. I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person C and she works out of her home also. C And the, F uh, software that does the taxes is just incredible. D You know, E I mean, she just, D you know, I expected to go and, D you know, drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later. C And, D you know, she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little P C. It was great. That's wonderful. I have often thought that, that having one at home would be neat. I just don't know if we would really use it that much. D You know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, definitely, definitely. I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, F oh, I guess, probably three years ago for Christmas, C and, D you know, it's got some stuff on it. It's got a nice little word processing software on it, D you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff. C And I don't think she's ever touched it D you know. It just, it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home. D You know, she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer <laughter> D you know. C So. Yeah, just as quickly. Now I know my boss has bought the software, F um, that he can, that his checkbook is on, on on a disk, C and he goes in and prin, and types his checks on the screen and then hits print, C and they print out on the checks, C and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places D you know, C and he just whips, out, D you know, I saw him yesterday morning over there, C and, C and he paid his monthly bills, C and he just, D you know, wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print C and it printed out D like ten checks, C and he just, D you know, they're perforated, C and he just ripped them off. They go through just a continuous thing on the printer C and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes C and there they went. D You know, C and he said, D you know, I can balance my checkbook in seconds, D you know because it's all in the computer, D you know. C So. That's exactly why. He said, D you know, he said, used to be I always sat looking for those, D you know. He said this way there isn't any. D You know, it does it for you. C So. This, D you know, there are some definitely, some, some advantages to it. It's just a matter of, like you say, are the advantages, does it justify the cost, if you're using it strictly for personal business. C So. Right. Yeah, yeah, As he grows up he'll be even more and more too. That'll be great. Uhhuh. Really. D Well, yeah, I. D Well I'm going through right now. I'm, D you know, going part time in the evenings, C and, D you know, I do, yeah, everything has to be typed. E I mean, they require it. You have to type it D you know, C and, C and so I'm up here, D you know, nights and weekends D you know, working on the little p, on the P C up here, D you know, typing stuff. C So I can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home, D you know, if you were going to school. D Well, you, I don't know. No, no, C and they probably used to have it. I just finished a, a major research paper a couple of weeks ago, C and I couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it. I, I don't know what they used to do <laughter> before they, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh C and you had to type all of his papers. F Oh gosh, F Oh, cut your time in half at least. At least. Uhhuh. You do the whole thing over. That's right. D You know, I remember when I was working in high school, D you know, I was working in an office, right after I got out of high school I continued working there for probably another year. C And we did everything on a typewriter everything. C But it's amazing, D you know, then, when, where, D you know, someone would have you type a letter, they did it right, they did it right. E I mean, they were, Yeah, they sit there C and they go, is this really what I want to say, C and you typed it C and that was it, C and now, D you know people just send it back over and over and over and over. D Well, we'll try this out and see what it looks like. Yeah. Yeah, instead of knowing what they want to say before they eve, they just, D you know, play with it, and, which in a way is nice to be able to do, C but, D you know, it, it gets a little out of hand sometimes. I've seen it get out of hand up here, D you know where we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now, and keeping up, D you know, of all the letters I type, how many cha, how many of them do I make changes on. And on each letter, what types of changes. Are they typos? Are they because I couldn't read it C or people just change a, D like, one word because they think it sounds better, or whatever. C And, D you know, she's also keeping a percentage, D you know, what percentage of letters am I retyping for whatever reason. C And there's D like one week, she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed D you know, C and it's like, D you know, it's ridiculous C and that was, that was the high week, C but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types. D Well, that's exactly right. D You know, she keeps, D you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show, D you know, look, this didn't really need to be changed. D You know, this is ridiculous and D you know, changing, add this time to now. D You know, E I mean, that's the kind of things, D you know, that she's keeping and showing, that, this was a big waste of time, it was a waste of paper, it was a waste, D you know to change something like that. D So. Anyway, maybe, D you know, maybe it'll, it'll help in some way, C but I don't know. There, there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative. Without a doubt. Without a doubt. D Well, I would like to get one at home some day. We've got a two year old son, C and so, D you know, some day I would like to get, even just D like the video tell, or something like that, D you know, just to, to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful. D You know C so, F Oh, I do too, I do too. The on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful, D you know, that sounds like such a great idea, D you know, it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it. D So. I know, my father had a P C, C and when we were in high school it was always fun. We could, F um, link in, C and I don't even remember now what it was called. C But you could link in and talk to other peo, talk to people all over the country, D you know. C And, D like, you have your own little code name, D you know, C and you'd type in du du du, Hi how are you, du du du, C and they'd type back and everybody, C and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time, C and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it, C and it was just great fun, D you know, It was very expensive, because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance, D you know. It was like a long distance phone call. C So, we were each limited to D like twenty minutes a day, D you know, C so. F Oh it added up big. D Well, D you know, we, my parents were divorced C and so the time we were D like visiting our father in the summer time, D you know, C so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it. I'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations, D you know. C But when you're doing the guilty father complex, D you know, because he's not there to watch us grow, you can kind of get all kinds of stuff. <Laughter> That's sad. D Well, it was nice to talk to you. Have a, You too. Bye.
