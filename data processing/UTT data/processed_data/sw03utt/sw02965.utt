Hi, my last, F uh, auto repair was my, my, F uh, alternator went out. I have a nineteen eightysix Toyota, F uh, it's a little Tercel <static>. C And, F uh, I have a fri, a friend whose real good with, F uh, repairing cars C so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, F uh, D you know, get a replacement part. C So we went to a, F uh, a, a place called Quality Auto Parts C an, C and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and, and everything C and they're, they're, F uh, very reasonable. C So, F uh, I bought the alternator, we p, put it on the car C and it, it didn't work, C and it blew out all the fuses. Yeah. F Uh, I bel, something like sixtynine dollars, som, something on that order. No, he hooked it up right. It, it was just that the, the part just, just didn't fit the car, C so. I took it back C and, F uh, he, he took the alter, the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator C and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them C and, F uh, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator C so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again C and it still didn't work, C and we took the car up to, F um, a little place called Pep Boys, I don't know if you have them in your area C but, F uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, F uh, car repair place also. C So, F uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, D you know, wouldn't start or anything C and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and, F uh, took them about an, an hour to, F um, figure out what was, what was blowing the fuse, C and it was, it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse. D Anyway, <breathing> ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer C and the only problem was that, F uh, it had to be a genuine Toyota, F uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, that, that, D you know, they sit in there and everything C but there's just some little difference that, F um, causes it not to work an i, Ye, yeah, I guess so C and that was my, that was my last experience. Uhhuh. Goodness, are you able, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, D well my car is, F uh, it's an eightysix C and I really hadn't had any, any trouble with it un, until that C and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it C and, F uh, C and this was just recent, C so I really can't complain about this one. F Um, D well, I used, I used to work, F uh, it was a seventy mile trip everyday, D you know, two ways was seventy miles. No, it was, it was just seventy miles. Yeah. C And, F uh, I did that for about three years C and it really, it really added up. I've only taken, F uh, maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow, F uh, down to Shreveport. C And, F uh, the rest of it was, D you know, it's just basically driving a long ways to work. C And now I drive D like twenty, twentythree miles each way, C so, I'm getting a little, a little, F uh, little relief, C but still I drive a long ways. C But I guess because they're highway miles, D you know, it's not so bad on your car as, as if it, D you know, were just regular street, D you know. Yes I do. Do you? Points. Uhhuh. F Uh, there's a number that you call, it's the same number that you, that you call to make a call. You, you call that number C and, C and, F uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message C and you can leave a message. I know someone that did that, you leave a message C and they'll, they'll call you back. F Oh really. Uhhuh. F Uh, let's see before I had this car I had a, F um, I bought an Audi five thousand C but I bought it, I bought it used. I, I just bought it from a friend who was going to, who just charged me what the dealer was going to give, give him for it for a tradein, C and, F uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it. I, I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it, C an I, C an I did get a couple of good years out of it C and the, F uh, the engine messed up on me C and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut, for the Audi dealer C and, F uh, he took the engine apart C and, D you know, he just said he couldn't fix it C so the engine never got put back together again. I, Wow. I think those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you <laughter>, I don't know, i, Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventyfour. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it's easy to, it's easy, I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars, engines and transmissions C and if you, I guess if you keep trad, changing them out you can keep a car for a long time. Course I guess I could do the same thing with the, the Toyota that I have, I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to, Yeah, I guess so, C but I just think they cost too much in the, in the first place, now a days. Uhhuh <pounding>. Uhhuh. F Oh, no <laughter>. How much was the alternator? Did he, did he hook up the wir, wiring wrong? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, they probably built that in so they could make money. D Well I had a weird, there's a little sensing device, F uh, in front of my, F uh, <<pause>> F um, A I'm not sure, right in front of the f, fan, it's a, it's an air conditioner sensing device. I don't know why, it actually, there's a metal piece that fits through the belts, F uh, C and somehow that broke off C and, F uh, I, I still can't figure out how it broke, C and, F uh, anyway, C so a, this piece obviously, F um, I have a Subaru, C and, F uh, I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera, C so. F Uh, this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks <laughter>. C And, C and I haven't had too many problems with my car, I got a eightyeight Subaru, G L X T C and it, F uh, C and then, D you know just basic maintenance and oil changes C an I, C and I do not do my oil changes C and I will not do my oil changes. I've, I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up, F um, trying to ge, F uh, yo, borrowed somebody else's jack C and I did this C and I went and bought everything, C so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there an, and, F uh, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube. C So that, that's, F um, D you know, <throat_clearing> as far as any maintenance on my car, I, I shy away from the oil changes, that's for sure. How did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years? F Oh, a hundred and forty mile trip? F Oh, thirtyfive miles each way. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you work for T I? Okay. I was going to ask you, D you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now, F um, I don't work for T I C and I'm just, I get these green, I don't know what you want to call them, fake <<pause>> point things, C and, F uh, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash <laughter>. F Oh, okay. Okay. Okay, all right, D well that's good to know. I haven't been doing th, this is the first time I've been called in a long time C and I haven't been doing it C so, C And, F uh, I've done it maybe twelve times. D Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much, C but, F uh, mine is mixed up too, I have to call and get it fixed <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh, F oh D well. I was driving a sixtysix Plymouth Fury. Yeah, yeah, C and, F Oh, tha, that's when they made cars, though, this things was, the body was in good condition C and D you know, it ran fine. It was starting to burn some oil. C And, F um, C but I had to <<pause>>, D you know, ge, D you know, I, after about thr, couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car C so. Yeah, D well, D you know, these, these cars made in the sixties and stuff, E I mean the steel, E I mean, the thickness, E I mean, i, those thin, they're just, th, you just don't see cars like that. C And they last a long time. C And they were simple too, the engines were simple and durable C and some people will still buy them, D you know, they'll, <Yawning> It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it, you're just better off buying another car.
