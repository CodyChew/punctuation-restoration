The way, I'll go ahead and start the way I work, F uh, the way I dress for work is, F uh, this year, nineteen ninetyone has been really suit and tie, C or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day. A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group. Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess. C So, F uh, I, I dress almost the same every day. E I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat. C But, it was very different before. How do you dress? Uhhuh. Yeah, I understand. Right. I understand, that's funny <throat_clearing>. C So, does it change? Your dress, no. C So, C or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that? C So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like, C but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something. F Oh, I see, I understand. F Oh. D Well, that's interesting. Let's see, F uh, what else about this, F uh, it, it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two, D like, two or three levels. That there's the t, upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, F uh, I would, if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research C and I guess you are. That we dress in the jeans C and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing. C But there's not much, It's nice that there's not a requirement for it. F Oh, yeah, right <laughter>. Yeah, I guess you see those once in a while. Sure. Yeah. That's right, that's right. I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress code, something about spaghetti straps, I'm not even sure what they are. F Oh, backless, all right. Okay, C so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation, C but, I think we, we did it <laughter>. Okay, C and, C and your name was Lisa. Great. I am, yes, C and I work in the north building. F Uh, D well, thank you. All right, good day. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, I'm a drafter, C so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes C and I have sweatshirt on today. C And that's pretty much the norm for me. If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked <laughter>. They ask me, D you know, what are you doing in a dress C and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately <laughter>. Ran out of jeans <laughter>. No. No, huhuh. No, huhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in, C but that's for my husband's job and not mine <laughter>. I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him, C but <laughter>, So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Mi, middle of the road. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Sometimes I think there should be. Some of these women around here <laughter> look like they came off of Harry Hines. <Laughter>. <Laughter> C And D you know the, they have the no shorts deal, C and some of these mini skirts, D you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being. C But, F uh, D You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code. Supposedly and backless things C but, I've seen those, too, C but, <Laughter>. F Uh, yeah. Lisa. Are you the Expressway sites? F Oh, okay. Thank you. Uhhuh, byebye.
