I, F uh, try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair. D Actually, F uh, that is really a sore spot with me. I, I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving C but, F uh, D like ten years ago, F uh, reliability of automobiles, at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal C and not only that, but the, F uh, repair capability of, F uh, service departments and dealerships was equally dismal C and, F uh, it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea. C But, F uh, I, Pardon? D Well, at that time, D actually, I had a Volkswagen Rabbit C and, F uh, it was, it was a real lemon. F Uh, subsequently I got a, F uh, Buick Century C and it wasn't as bad. C But, F uh, last year I bought a Honda Accord C and I take it in once every seventyfive hundred miles for its periodic maintenance C and that is it. C And it's wonderful. F Huh. F Huh. F Huh. D So, wha, what do you have? All the more reason to, F uh, have a, a Honda. D, C so you bought a Pontiac? Now thi, wha, how old is the car? F Huh. F Huh. F Huh. C So apparently it was the same one that was on there. Apparently just, F uh, re, re, F uh, probably filled the, the brake fluid up C and that was it. C So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service, F Huh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well that's wonderful. You're lucky. F Oh, really? F Huh. <Noise> <TV> <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. C So do you have a car? Do you have a car? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. We used to have a Honda Accord C and they're good. They're really good cars. Every time I get taken to an auto repair place, D you know, every time I go, I get taken. Bad D you know. Woman goes in C and they go all right, we got a sucker. Let's ge, see how much money we can get out of her, D you know <laughter>. That's what happens every time. F Uh, C so, I have a Pontiac Six Thousand. Yeah. C But our Honda just got old and just wore out. It was, let's see, eleven years old C and it just, <lipsmack> just out of it C so <laughter>. No, huhuh. My hu, F uh, exhusband's, this is, just happened a couple of weeks ago. He's my exhusband C but just a few months ago when he was my husband, F uh, his father gave us this car C and everything is wrong with it. E I mean, the power steering fluid leaks, the oil leaks, the brake fluid leaks, D you know, F Uh, eightyseven. C And he just doesn't take care of things C and C but I was awarded the car C so. There is a man in my church that is a mechanic C and I can trust him. C So he is trying to get, D you know, things fixed on it. C But it's just, D you know, leak, leak, leak everywhere. C But, F uh, D you know, I hate to go into a, a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not, D you know, and charge me twice as much. The last time I took it into a repair shop, the man told me I needed a master cylinder. C So I said okay. C And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars <noise> C and then, F uh, about a month later, a man was looking at my car C and he asked me, D you know, not a man, not a repair man, but just a friend C and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on C and he looked at C and he said that's not a new master cylinder C and I didn't even know what one was. C And, F uh, he showed it to me C and it was old, rusty, just awful. It was no more new than nothing. F Uh, more than likely. That was it, probably. It was ve, I was so irritated. C And that's happened to me more than once or twice. Jus, just, just about every time I've went in somewhere. C And, C and you ju, can hardly find one, D you know. The guy that's doing most of my, my car now, F uh, goes to my church C and that's the only reason, D you know, I go to him because I know him C and I know he will tell me the truth. C Because he doesn't even charge me for, for doing it C so he's not going <<mispronounced>> to, D you know, take me. I just pay for the parts C and he does it so. Yeah. Yeah, I am, C so, I don't know. I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car, they're usually the worst one of all. We took our Honda to the Honda dealership C and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car. Yeah. C And so, idiots as we were, neither one of us knew much about cars, we, D you know, they told us we just had to have one C and we bought one. We didn't no more need no new engine, give me break, <laughter> D you know. C So it was, it was not good C and, F uh <TV>.
