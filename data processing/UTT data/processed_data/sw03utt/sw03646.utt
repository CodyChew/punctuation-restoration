Okay, F uh, D so what do you think about the school system? F Uh, why did you choose a private school? Public school. F Oh, has he? Then how does he like it? C So he's been there all the time. How big of a school is it? A hundred per grade, that's a good size. Kind of gives them the, D you know, I get a little leery of the real small ones <noise> that they don't get much interaction with kids C but, F uh, C So they don't, That's good. Uhhuh. F Huh. Right. Still enjoy the, Right. F Uh, one thing I think I've noticed is, F uh, my oldest is in kindergarten, C so I'm in a little different ballgame. I'm just, starting her, C but, F uh, seems to me that, F uh, kids these days, F uh, <throat_clearing> can really get away with murder C and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected as much C and, F uh, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say. C And, F uh, makes me a little nervous that, F uh, students don't seem to show that respect C and, No! Heavens, no. No, you wouldn't. C And, F uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what I <laughter> understand, F uh, I think that's wrong. I think we need to get back to the, <breathing> show some respect C and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that C but, Right. For other people C and, D Well, how do you think that that's happened? You think our society's just, F uh, stopped talking out, C or this, F uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, F uh, Right. Right. That just isn't coming through is it. No. E I mean, I remember, F uh, D well, it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's. We used to have to wear dresses C and then you had to, a, go to dresses, they had to be a pantsuit C and it was polyester C and it had to be matching C and, Yes. Exactly. Yes. Yes, C so it's really changed. It's, F uh, really kind of <throat_clearing> gone the rounds, C so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree. They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit, C so I, Do, F uh, does this school your son goes to, do they, F uh, re, require to wear a uniform C or, Uhhuh. Yeah, there are quite a few of your s, D Well, I think they're, they're having a lot of trouble right now. I know my son goes to a private school, C but, F uh, I think they're, big city public schools by definition are having a, a tough time right now just from, F uh, probably from budget cuts and, and everything else going on. D Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a, at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school, C so he's, he has been going to private since kindergarten <laughter>. D So, F Oh, he's loved it. He is a senior in high school this year C so he's, Yeah, he's done it the whole twelve and, F uh, so many years C and it's been, F uh, it's been really good for him. F Uh, overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper school, upper four grades, F uh, about four hundred and something C so it's maybe a hundred per grade. Yeah, it really is. Yeah, that was, we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture C and he's done, he's done really well, C and just, he was just ahead at an early age C and I didn't feel like, F uh, in, what was available, particularly in the first three grades C and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program. C And I just didn't think that was going get it. I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, F uh, every day. But yet still be with his peers age wise. You're just getting started. <Laughter>. Yeah, I know. That's a big problem. We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school. Wouldn't have thought of it C and C and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe C and, Yeah, C but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be, basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in, in responsible positions <noise>, have not, F uh, I don't think have, <breathing> had that basic <breathing> upbringing in a lot of cases C and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands. I guess, I, D Well, the world changes, C so E I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be. E I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things. They have a whole lot more, F uh, variety of things they they're, that they see and do at an earlier age, C so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, C but, C but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to, to teach, F uh, basic values and basic, F uh, respectful of, F uh, ness of authority. C And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore, F uh, Yeah, had to wear dresses, didn't you? C And when it was skirts, it was D like, get down on the floor C and we hold the ruler up here C and it's no more than so many inches above the knee <laughter>. C Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time. Yeah, I think that probably does have, have something to do with it, C and it's also, No, they do not do uniforms, although one, where he was between D like second and eighth grade did.
