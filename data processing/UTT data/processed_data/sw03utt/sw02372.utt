D Well, how about you. Do you use P C s? Yeah. You and me both. Huhuh. Yeah. C And so I like the I B M P C, personally. C But that's pretty much everything I've worked with C and, F uh, I've become so accustomed to it that, F uh, it's second nature. What do you use? Yeah. F Oh, huhuh. Huhuh. Huhuh. F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. C So we, F um, we use, it's an I B M P S two also. C And, F um, D you know, every now and then the file gets so big, that, D you know, it moves slower than I'd like C but I, F uh, I do mainly graphic work on it. And, F uh, a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it. C And, F uh, I don't know, I just, I enjoy working with them. There's so many capabilities out there, E I mean, the things you can do are endless. Huhuh. Yeah. Huhuh. We have one at home, C but I just don't find the time that I can use it. Yes. Huhuh. <Laughter> One of the reasons why I got mine, was before I went on maternity leave, they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because, I am pretty much the, like you said, the guru, in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is, C and, F um, C so they didn't know how it was going to work, they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could, in the decks machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so. C But, F uh, D you know, it's, F uh, it's almost like we could become too dependent on them. C And F oh, I, we use a lot of free lance. C And, F uh, that's, F uh, pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things. C And, F um, it, F uh, compared to the way the things have upgraded, Have, F uh, really, what's the word I'm looking for, I'm just totally drawing a blank <laughter>. C But, F uh, the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great. It's remarkable the things we can do now, and compared to, D you know, a few years. Just the power, I'm, I'm trying to, F uh, get an updated machine. Mine, F uh, is just putting along <laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Huhuh. F Um, now that's awful. Huhuh. Okay. F Oh, okay. Right. F Oh, yes. Right. The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers. Yeah. Huhuh. F Um, we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer. C And, F uh, it's just so, the budget restraints and things like that, it's, makes it difficult C and, F uh, Huhuh. F Oh, huhuh. C And we, F uh, got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars. Yeah, I don't remember what kind they were, C but, F uh, we do a lot of transparencies. Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out. C So they just want black and white, which D see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick. Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it. C But, F uh, it, F uh, No, huhuh. If it was a customer presentation then that would be different. We would want to razzledazzle a bit. C But, F uh, it's, F uh, yeah. We have one in the office C and if we want, D well in our area, if we want to use it, we have to, D you know, like you said, you had to change it, put it on a disc, And carry it over to there, and see if they're not using the printer, Right <laughter>. And, F uh, wait for an opportunity to use it. Huhuh. I know, I know, I understand. Huhuh. F Oh, huhuh. Right. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. C So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology. Huhuh. Huhuh. Right. We find it hard to believe sometimes, E or hard to understand when, F uh, we work for a computer company, and, F uh, how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated, That's obsolete C and the guys that, some of the guys that run this place are very tight C and it's like, D Well, why do we need this, can't you do that with, D you know, what we have, C and when we try and then they complain about, this doesn't look good. F Oh constantly. <Laughter> It seems everything I do is computer related. C And if it goes down, then we're stuck all day. Huhuh. Yeah. D Well, I have an, I, I B M P S two, model thirty. It's kind of, kind of getting too slow for me, C but my job, I'm an E D P auditor, C so I audit, F uh, computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level. C And I use my personal computer constantly, not only do I do P C type things like, F uh, using lotus or word processors, I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine. C So all I have on my desk is my P C, C but I'm, I'm getting, not only our local area network, C but I'm getting two separate mainframe machines, also. Huhuh. Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah <<Voice faded>>. Yeah. I've become kind of the P C guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground, C And there's three of us E D P auditors C and one of the three of us has an accounting background C and so she's not real proficient in P C's C and the other just has, not used P C's that much, C so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing C and I'm the administrator for our local area network. C And I need to keep that going C and, So, I, I'm, I couldn't live my life without a P C. I don't have one at home, Yeah. Right now I would rather not have one at home, because I would work at home. F Um, we've got a couple of portable lap top P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot, to do work. If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night <laughter>. <<There are many breaks in the tape.>> Yeah. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Huhuh. Yeah. Right. <Laughter>. Yeah. C And it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip, C but, F uh, I don't know <laughter> if my boss will spring for it. C But I'm determined to brake mine C so he has to get me another one. We think about that a lot. D Well, that's what I do. We had a printer, a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer. C And we had about ten people sharing this printer by, it was attached to D like a central P C C and you had to take your diskette to the P C to print something. C So the first thing <<voice has faded>> when I started working at this bank, is, I said, D well, now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up. C So I talked my boss into investing in a, it's not a, F uh, a F uh, real elaborate local area network, C but we can share the printer C and we can, F uh, send files to each other, C And we can mail, send mail messages to each other, which is good enough, it's what we need. C And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet. C And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it. C But once he bought it, he has been so pleased. It's, it's fast, it's quite, F oh, it has good copy. Yeah. I've got a little, little, F uh, I B M Pro Printer on my desk, C but, C and I can use either the Pro Printer C or I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer. The one that's on the network or my own. C So if I just need something real quick, and I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed, I can just print it in my office. Yeah. They have gotten really cheap. Hewlett Packard makes, it's actually a dot matrix printer C but the quality is almost laser quality. C And I think it's called the desk jet C and they're, A you understand, I think they're about five hundred dollars now. F Oh, really. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C So that's all you need for D like charts and stuff. You don't need them in four colors. Yeah. <Laughter>. You use the sneak, system. Yeah. Yeah, we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer. Until they got off the machine. That was, I was amazed when I came to work, I worked at the, F uh, D well, it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival C and now N C N B C And now N C N B's got a little larger market share, C but it's the only, F uh, D well, it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas. It's the only one that's still alive. D Any way, I work in a big prestigious place. C And I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this, this huge holding company, sharing a H P Rugged Writer <laughter>. I was going F oh, wait a minute <laughter>. Come on guys, this is crummy. Yeah, yeah. We're pushing real hard though. We're, we're trying, D well, D see, the entire bank is not like that. We, the, the bank philosophy is one of innovation and, Lead the market. It's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the, F uh, the senior vice president, over audits, is cheap. C And it's real hard to pry money out of him to, to do these things, C but I was, I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better C and, F Um. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately, the, the, F uh, computer equipment and, and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly, D like for instance, we bought a <<voices have faded>>...
