<Breathing> Jeri? We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it. <Laughter> They're usually pretty broad anyway. Where do you live? Okay, D so, that's a, I'm in Richardson, C so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, F uh, Maceo High School in Dallas. It is, D you know, No, mine are already in college now, C so I don't have to, at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages. That's true. Yeah, D well, I just, I just don't understand how, A of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available. F Oh, my heavens. D Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting <noise> more prosecution. D You know, C because I don't, now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, D you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped, C and people don't do anything. A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper F oh, about a two weeks ago now. C And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help. C But nobody, nobody did anything. D You know, E I mean they heard someone calling for help. Nobody even called the police to say, D you know, I hear a strange screaming I'm afraid, D you know, if you, I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves. Yeah. I just, D you know, it's, it's really <noise> frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons C and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention. Yes. Yeah, D well, D you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just, I don't know, people just don't, I don't know, I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person. C But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today. Yeah <<very faint>>. Let me ask you, getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, he didn't have a license for the gun, correct? Uhhuh. Yes. That's a rather, rather broad topic <laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, we live in Plano. F Uh, C and where you are? Uhhuh. Right. Right, that is so frightening. F Uh, do you have children in school? Yeah. D Well, I have, my oldest is his first year in high school C so we have all this to, to look forward to, C and it is really frightening, F uh, to think that you can't even <breathing> send them to school in safety. E I mean, certainly, D you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas, C but, D you know, <breathing> when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening. C And, F uh, <breathing> I really, D you know, they're coming down on the principal, C but I really don't know <breathing> what they can do. E I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence C and the kids having access to weapons and drugs C and I, I really don't know what, what can be done. D Well <breathing>, I don't either, C but apparently they just really are. F Uh <lipsmack>, E I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, D you know, about as innocent as you could get for <breathing>, for being in a, a large <breathing> area. C But, D you know, my son comes home and tells me that, D you know, he hears kids talk about having guns C and <breathing>, F uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun. C And, E I mean, it just scared me to death C and, D you know, they called the police C and, C and nothing happened, C but my goodness <laughter>, D you know, it, it could have easily. Maybe so. Yeah. F Oh, no. I just can't imagine that. Right. Right, D well, I can see, D you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, D you know, it could be dangerous, C but certainly I can't understand not calling the police. I, Right. D Well I, I think you're right there. I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business, C but I think that's real dangerous C and, F uh, I don't know. I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, D you know C and <breathing>, if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just <breathing> get out of it or call for help, whichever. C But, F uh, Yeah. <Breathing> D Well, maybe this thing with <breathing>, with the child at school, maybe that will <lipsmack> make people think a bit more C and, D you know, take some steps to, to correct it. I don't know, it's, it really is, is frightening. I, F uh, I don't know. E I mean, I don't know the details. This was not a child that was on the team. It was someone that, F uh, show, D you know, just kind of showed up at the field. F Uh, it was a, a student age person, C but I'm not even,
