Hi Diana. Have you all been able to do much as a family these days? Have you all been able to do much as, F uh, as a full family these days, all of you. Yeah. Do you work outside the home? Yeah, I don't either, it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way. Yeah. C So you have a break too. Uhhuh. Yeah, we have family that's far away. It sounds like you might too. Yeah. Right, C and phone calls that's about, <laughter> about it. That's wha, D yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things. Especially since my youngest one is <sneezing>, E excuse me, only fourteen months. She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing, and likes to go places. That's right. F Oh that's a big thrill for them. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Have, F um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place? We ju, we haven't lived here too long C and we went there a couple of weeks ago C and, F uh, <throat_clearing>. F Oh, yeah, we, I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two. We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two. The one we went in had, F uh, the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that, D like a kids place area. That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there. Where's that. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh yeah. F Oh, that does sound like fun. It's a little bit of a ways, That's right. Uhhuh. That's sounds fun too. C And, C and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting, <Throat_clearing> That sounds fun I think maybe we'll try to do that. Uhhuh. Yeah. C Because they can just do, you don't have to have tokens for everything. Yeah. That does sound like fun. D Well I've gotten some good ideas from you <laughter>. Definitely. D Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes C but I'm sure that will be good. It was good talking to you. I really appreciate your suggestions. Okay, byebye, Hi <baby_crying>. Pardon me. F Oh, yes, we've, F uh, been, F um, we've gone other, D you know, all kinds of places, we go out to dinner, we take the kids to the park, C and, F uh, D you know, <baby_crying> whenever we, he, my husband has time off or something, we take them to the zoo, C or we, D you know, we do everything we can possibly as a family. No, I don't. Yeah, it does, C an, C an then, F uh, D you know, my husband enjoys spending time with the kids, D you know, he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them. C So he, they can have time with him an. Right, C so C and we, F uh, we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home, D you know, we have, we try to spend D like Monday nights, we call it family home evening, and, have our kids, F uh, D you know, have little lessons with them, and, D you know, just see, count, see how things are going in our family and, D you know, teach them about their grandparents or something like that. Bring out pictures of them so they get to know them C and, we just do all kinds of fun things like that C an. Yeah, we do, C so they, D you know, the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures. C And, F uh, Yeah, right C and, F uh, D you know, they, we, D you know, we go to the park C or we go in the backyard and sit down C an, Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and with, D you know, me being at home and just having the one income, D you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, D you know, extra things. C So, you, you make more fun than, D you know. D You know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or, D yeah, or, F uh, D you know, go get a bag of M and M's or something like that, they, they think that's a lot of fun. C So we just, we try to spend as much time as we can. We, D you know our, our whole weekends are divi, are devoted to our children except for we might go out, D you know, one evening or something, C but during the day, D you know, it's all devoted to our kids C and they come, go to church with us C and so. Yeah, C so. Yes, yes, that's what. Uhhuh, the kids thought that was wonderful. I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into, it was about a year or so ago, when we went. Uhhuh, yeah. Yeah, yeah they had a lot of fun in there C and, F uh, there's, F uh, there's some petting, D you know, like, F uh, F uh, I think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting, D you know, like a farm that you can go to C and the kids can pet animals and stuff. That's on Plano Road, F uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road, it's D like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road <children_talking>. C And that's a lot of fun. They have tours going through there C and, F uh, the kids think that was a lot of fun, too. We take, D you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz C or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonalds, D you know, they don't go for the food they go for the, to play around C and, There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business, C and it's a indoor fun park C and it has a bunch of different rides for kids. C And parents get in free C and it's D like, during the week, it's D like five dollars admission per child, all day. The petting farm, yeah. Yeah, yeah C and the one in Mesquite is, F uh, Scyene exit. C And it's, it's, F uh, the kids just had a wonderful time there, they, D you know, you just pay that admission, C and then all the, the, the rides are free. D You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, D you know, those little quarter rides, D you know, to, and stuff like that C but, they thought that was lot of fun. You can have birthday parties there C an, I think that was better than D like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do. Yeah, right. C So they had a lot of fun. Yeah. I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, D you know, inexpensively as possible, C so. Yeah, that will be good, yeah. D Well it was good talking to you. F Oh, no problem. D Well, take care. Byebye.
