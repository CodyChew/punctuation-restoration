D Well, how, how do you feel about the immigration laws? Yeah, D well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws. Oh. Uhhuh. F Huh. No, that doesn't make a whole of lot sense. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well, F uh, my, F uh, my family is from, F uh, Europe from, D well, from England and Ireland and, F uh, have been in this country for, F oh, more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years, C so, I don't have any, any, F uh, relatives that I am, E or, E or, F uh, several generations back, that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family. They were all, they were all born here C so I don't have any real strong ties with any, with, with the immigration laws. I don't, because I don't, I don't have any personal feelings about them C and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I, D Well, I agree with that, I, I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted, F uh, not only would, would the United States become over populated, D well, more over populated awfully quickly, I think it, it would bring in a lot of, F uh, people that are, run out of other countries or in trouble in, in other countries. I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their, their brand of crime. I was not aware, aware of that. Uhhuh. Yeah. I think so <laughter>. D Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. Okay <laughter>. Thanks. Bye. At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. F Uh, particularly for, F uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. F Um, I think we should permit, F uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, F uh, particularly the, F uh, <inhaling> the Jewish, F uh, <breathing>, F uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, F uh, several years. C And, I think we have, F uh, F uh, too much restriction on the, F uh, on the Orientals also, C but, of course, that's just my opinion <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, we seem to, F uh, to favor certain, F uh, F uh, countries particularly South American countries. C And, F uh, <inhaling> there is no, F uh, <breathing> F uh, I have nothing, of course, against, F uh, the, F uh, the South Americans or, F uh, or Hispanics, in that sense, C but I think we, F uh, are more restrictive of the, F uh, so called eastern, F uh, European countries than we, F uh, we should be. Of course, that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe, C so <laughter>. C And, F uh, C so I think, F uh, D you know, the, F uh, embargo we placed on the, F uh, on the Russian Jews, although we of, F uh, spent years and years, F uh, lobbying for their release and their ability to, F um, immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred, we <inhaling> simply said that, F uh, <breathing> instead of the, F uh, hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, F uh, two thirds. C So. I do not quite go along with that, C but <laughter>. No. C And I still think, D you know, again, kind of having, F uh, F uh, within this century, come from a, F uh, an immigrant family, or immigrant families on both sides. Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants C so, I'm a little touchy <throat_clearing> every now and then about that <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, my <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I think in a way, though, F uh, F uh, I also have, F uh, an <laughter> opposite point of view, which is, F uh, although I believe we should, F uh, permit, F uh, D you know, constant immigration into this country F uh, I think we should, F uh, primarily for economic reasons, I think we should have, F um, some quotas, of course, my family and I, again, again that was, D you know, my grandparents came over during the time when, F uh, there were quotas. C So they had to wait, F uh, D you know, in, F uh, certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over. C So, D you know, <laughter> C but, F uh I think unrestricted immigration, I think, is not, F uh, is not best, F uh. Uhhuh. D Well, D you know, there's another aspect of this, too. They're also, F uh, F uh, diminishing the, F uh, health restrictions which, D Well, yes. There are, were some, F uh, regulations over, I don't know whether they're laws passed or, or whatever they're called, F uh, just recently, where, F uh, people with certain diseases cannot be excluded, F uh, from, F uh, immigration. Age is one, for example, C and, F uh, recently, F uh, tuberculosis, which at one time, if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country F uh, they dropped that also. C So I think in, in some as, some ways we are, F uh, becoming a little too egalitarian in that, in that sense, C but, F uh, I think we should be a little more circumspect about it. Again, my opinion <laughter>. Think we've talked long enough? <Laughter> All right. I, I, I have talked long enough. <Laughter>. Thank you. Goodbye.
