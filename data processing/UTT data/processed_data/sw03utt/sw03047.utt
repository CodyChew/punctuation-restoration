F Uh, yes, yes, I have a daughter. Yeah. She's only about, F uh, F uh, a little less than two years old. No. Yeah <laughter>. <Sigh> F Uh, <sigh>, no, F uh, F um, no particular school. F Uh, I think that's really a decision th, that, They, D well, help them make in terms of, D you know, what they are, they are wanting to do. D You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and, D You know what, not only what you can afford, but what, what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are. C So, F uh, D you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do. F Uh, University of Mississippi. F Uh, D well, it was, <sigh> D well, it was within the state. C But it, it was not necessarily local, it was, What's the criterion for choosing to go there? F Uh, D well, at the time, I was, F uh, thinking of going pre med C and in the state, F uh, they had the best pre med F uh, curriculum for the, F uh, state institutions. It was choice between there and, F uh, a private college that, F uh, was a bit more expensive. At the time, <sigh> we really could not afford it C so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me. It, F uh, I enjoyed it. No. No, no, it was a six hour drive. I was, F uh, it was like another world. Basically, it was a, D no it was a, did not get home that often, D you know, C and at that age it's, F uh, it's kind of, kind of difficult sometimes. Especially, if you have not been away a lot that extended <sigh>. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, that's true. Yeah, that, that's like, D you know, when I went on to get my, my masters I, F uh, basically was, D you know, it was where I was at the time. D You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled C and I was trying to work. C But, F uh, C so when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go. F Um, F uh, the computer science center. F Uh, north building. F Uh, about three years. F Uh, yeah, I have, F uh, F uh, no D actually, E I mean I came straight from school to here. D So, cause this was the first, first real job after getting my degree. After my masters. My undergraduate degree was not in, not in what my masters was. C So I made a career change basically. Yeah. One day I would like to, F uh, D you know, the, F uh, I, I like the school where I went. E I mean, C and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to. C Or the school where I got my masters at, which, which was a different school. C And, F uh, I liked it almost as well. F Uh, C but, F uh, D you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there. I, D you know, think that's <sigh> If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. <sigh> Although I ca, F uh, would get quite a break on, on tuition <laughter>. Yeah, C because they, F uh, allow for, F uh, F uh, tuition, F uh, break for out of state students who children of alumnae. D Well certain schools do it. This school does. C So, F uh, It's, it, I, I was involved in some, F uh, F oh, alumnae recruiting, F uh, here in town, F uh, recently, F uh, D well last year <sigh>. F Uh, C and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to <sigh> to, trying to get people interested in your school, D you know. C And they were, this was a college night at a, at a high school in Richardson. C And it was, C And there were a bunch of kids, D you know, C and a bunch of schools. There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids. It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, D you know, your, school C And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and had heard of, D you know, our school. And, and were interested in it. F Uh, D you know, we, F uh, situations like that, you don't realize, D you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others. C And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that. That worked out so well. I think so. I don't know offhand C but, F uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there. <sigh> C So, there, There was one mother who, F uh, came by right, even, before we started, who, who obviously was, F uh, very interested in getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something C and she was wanting some more information. C But she was, her, her daughter was, F uh, a, a, ma, ma, dru, a majorette or something. D You know, a baton twirler or something C and she was <laughter> she was, letting us know she, how, how good her daughter was. She had cards printed up, D actually describing, D you know, business cards describing her daughter's, F uh, D you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all this, C and she was, had these business cards she was passing out C and it was <sigh> quite a production. <laughter> I think some parents go a little bit overboard. <breathing> Yes. <exhaling> Do you have children? Do you. How old is she? F Uh, <laughter> I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, F uh, promote a college or anything, F huh. <Laughter> I've got one that's seven and one that's three, C so, we, F uh, we started saving, C but that's all. D So, do you, is there, are you planning to, D like, encourage your children to go to a particular school? That you are going to let them make. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Where did you go to school? Oh. Was that local or, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. C But I, E I mean, so what's,, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D So you, did you commute everyday then C or, F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay, when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour C or, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D So, did you go there, D like, straight out of high school? Yeah. F Uh, D see I did not get my degree until later on, C so I just finished mine a couple of years ago. C And, F uh, D you know, I guess, D you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier C but, Uhhuh. Right. Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. Wh, which group do you work in in T I? F Oh, F uh, where is that at? I see. How long do you work for T I? Did you work somewhere else, D like sounds like you got your masters before here C or, I see. Uhhuh. After your masters or after your, I see. I see. Uhhuh. I see. D Well, let's see <laughter> I, have not D you know, there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, D you know, just like you said. F Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that, C so I, I have not really made up my mind, D you know, whether to encourage them to go different places C or, Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Yeah. F Um, because you went there. F Um. I didn't know that. Yeah. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, your own school, Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. D So did you drum up any interest then C or, D Well, that's good. Uhhuh. C And that, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Yeah it sounds like it. D Well D you know I think Richardson is probably D you know one of the places that would definitely
