D Well, the types of vacations that I usually take, I usually come back more tired after my vacation, then I do, D you know, before I take it. F Um, I need to definitely take a vacation where all, all I do is rest. C And I guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home. C But, F um, the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida. I enjoy the beach. <Laughter> Antibeach. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter> You might be like I am. I enjoy, I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas, C but I really don't like to get in the water, the ocean. I prefer a swimming pool <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. I can understand that. Uhhuh. That would be nice. Uhhuh. I know I've taken several vacations to Colorado, C and I used to live in Colorado, F oh, sometime ago for a couple of years, C and I really enjoyed that. Uhhuh. Yeah. I've never been up to the Yellowstone area. C So, That's right. That's right. You got that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, you have, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to <laughter> then. <Laughter> Right. That's right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It would be sort of, I feel like it would be confining. D You know I would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself. Uhhuh. Yes. I, I agree. I can, I can do that too, C and, F uh, D you know, I think if I had, if I had the money, I would probably go to Europe every year. C Because, D you know, I think that they have, they have it all over there in just a few tiny, two, two miles. D You know, there's mountains C and there's beaches C and <laughter> it's all right there. C So, Uhhuh. <Laughter> Oh. Right. <Laughter>. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, <laughter> I am, after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach. Uhhuh. We went to, F uh, Cape Hatteras. D Well, we, we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland, C and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days. C And, F uh, F uh, the, the waves were huge. I've never quite seen waves like this one C and, F uh, I was standing in water not more than, in barely above my ankles C and, F uh, D you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles. C And I was standing there talking to my daughter C and this really big wave came and totally threw me, C and one foot did not come out of the sand, <laughter> C and it tore the ligaments in my knee <laughter>. C So I'm never going to another beach again, <laughter> ever. I'm ma, D Well, I, I love to go and play around. At least I always did but although D actually, <breathing> my, I like the mountains. I, F uh, <breathing> I don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about living here. C And I basically, <breathing> don't want to go to a hot place <laughter> on vacation <laughter>. Oh. I, my dream vacation is Alaska. This is just someplace I've always wanted to go C and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation <laughter> up there. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'd, I'd like that. F Uh, I haven't been to Yellowstone for a long, long time C and I would, F uh, we've been talking about going there next summer <breathing>. F Uh, I don't know we'll have to, to, It's been a long time. C But D you know, it seems when your family is, is different places, a lot of trips involved <laughter> going to visit <laughter>. F Oh, I'm, we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from. C And my mother and his mother <breathing> live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here <breathing>. C And, F uh, <breathing> we've got one of our, our kids lives out on the east coast C and so we have to, D you know, go to those. D Well, I know C but I'm tired of them <laughter>. I want <laughter> to go someplace different <laughter> up there. F Uh, my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, F uh, <breathing> A money be no object. D You know, C so just absolutely, D you know, first class fly where I want to, rent a car if I want to. F Uh, D you know, just the, really the nicest hotels <laughter> and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, D well, let's take this little side trip, D you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, F um, <breathing> D you know, <laughter> again we, we fit that in there or not. C And, F uh, that, that's what I, F um, D you know, that's what I would like to do. I have no interest, for example, in taking a cruise. To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is <laughter> mind boggling. Yeah. Uhhuh <noise>. Yeah, I just, F uh, that, that does absolutely nothing for me. <Noise> C But, F uh, I don't know I can say that I think my, my favorite spots are still to go, to go where there's mountains and, and a lot of trees and, and wildlife to view C and, C and, F uh, <noise> I like that kind of stuff. I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Noise>. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, I, I guess I've never really thought about it that way. Our, F uh, <laughter> we have <breathing> a daughter who's almost thirteen C but she's, F uh a very picky eater C and our, our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is, D you know, D gee, Holly would starve to death if we, <laughter> D you know, we took her <Laughter> into the country C so <laughter>. C So, <laughter> C but I, I would like if, D you know it was anywhere in the world to go, I guess, even though it's hot, I would like to go to Africa.
