C So, Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research? I'd agree, too, C but, E I mean, it seems like it just makes economic sense in that, D you know, F uh, D you know, it would have made even better economic sense to, to, to have had a lot more research than a l, l, longer ago. D You know, C because, D you know, C because, F uh, the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients. Uhhuh. I think they cover AIDS, C but what they do is, F uh, if, D you know, you apply for, for to get a, a insurance policy they'll, F uh, check to see if you're H I V positive C and if you are, not only will they not give you, F uh, a policy, C but they'll, F uh, they have D like, there's D like, D you know, a database of people that have tested positive, C so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again. Yeah. I think a lot of it was, was just that, D you know, becau, because of, of the, audi, D you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about. That, Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah, F uh, yeah, one, one, one h, one humorous retort I heard, heard someone, D you know, who claimed that, D you know, AIDS was, D you know, God's punishment was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people. C But, F uh, <Laughter>. D So, F uh, F Uh, do you think, d, you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough right now to, Private organizations. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. E I mean, it seems that, D you know, it's just, D you know, of, it's just going to reach a steady, a steady state a let, a lot, lot higher point than it will if we, D you know, we'd nip it in the bud to q, quote Barney Fife. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I would probably agree with that. F Uh, C so do, do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of, F uh, people? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think it's, I think it stands a really interesting question of, F uh, I think we need, we definitely need more of it, definitely. F Oh, yeah, yeah, for certain. Exactly. Exactly. Does, does D like, d, do health insurance policies, D like, for companies and things, do they cover diseases like that? Uhhuh. F Um, D well, that's, C but that's why they should have s, started doing stuff before. E I mean, still, D you know, since it's dormant for such a long time, there's still probably a lot of people, D you know, before the tests ever really came out who are, who are draining a lot of money right now. D You know, Right. Right. Right, C and all these Godfearing people were like, D well, D you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera, et cetera. F Uh. <Laughter> Yeah. Boy, that's a good one. <Laughter>. Yes? No, I really don't. I did, I did D like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff, C and, F uh, really we're not doing much at all, E I mean, most of what gets raised, E I mean, it's not really federal movement, most of what gets raised, gets raised by, F uh, F uh, D you know, conscious, D yeah, communities and things like that, D you know. D Like, F uh, San Francisco has a, a real, F uh, strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff C and C and, F uh, get, they get donations from the community, D you know, they're real, And from corporations around the, around the city, D you know, for AIDS research and that kind of thing C and, F uh, I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, D you know, rather than just in the places where it's, D you know, where it's predominated so far, because it's, D you know it's bound to spread <ringing>. Right <laughter>. Yeah. I don't know, I don't know, I, I, I don't know what the likelihood of that is, C but, E I mean, D you know, people really waking up. Especially with the ultra conservatives move our, our political system s, sort of seems to be taking. Yeah C so, <Breathing> God, that's a good question, Fish. I don't know, F uh, I think, I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education, not support or, or, research per se, but, but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society, D you know, kind of like lepers would D you know C and it's really, it's really not necessary, F uh, until, until the, disease reaches its final stage, D you know, becomes really infectious C and, F uh, I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand, D you know, try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not, D you know, they don't, they don't have to be just completely <breathing> cut off from, from the community C and that, C and, F uh, I don't know, I guess I think that, that, F uh, <breathing> research is, I guess the most important, just because I, D you know, it, it really needs to come to an end. D You know. I don't know. I don't know, Fish. What do you think about that subject?
