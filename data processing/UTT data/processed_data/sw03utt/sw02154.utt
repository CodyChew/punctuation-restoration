<Static> How do you usually keep up with current events? Do you, Yeah, I don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday, C so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and, and try to catch one of the morning talk shows, C and then I usually end up flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening. I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the, the week's hot events. C So, I try to, I try to catch that, if nothing else. For, for local news I think we do real well where it's, we live in a kind of small town, C but I think we get excellent local coverage, F um, C and I like the national news that we see, we, we watch N B C C and I think they do a real good job. C So, I'm, I've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get, how about you? Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but I think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us, C and like you said, save the commentaries because I'm going to listen to the, the news and draw my own opinions. I don't really need their help to do that. I don't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is. Uhhuh. Right. I used to, C but I don't anymore, maybe once or twice a year. Uhhuh. Really? Yes. Yeah. D Well, I had heard a couple of people, D you know, that I had talked to about certain programs say that, D you know, they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the, D you know, news articles or whatever they had, they had already been familiar with. C So, I started questioning just how, how bias they really were, C so. <<Very faint>> F Huh. No, not really, D you know, in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I've seen C but I never got to see his actual nightly news. I liked, I, I did grow up with David Brinkley. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, we, we used to watch, F um, him and I guess, John Chancellor. C And I always liked David Brinkley C and I, C and I used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting, C but on the nightly news, D now, he goes into his commentary C and that's where I get, get into the problem with, with him. I frequently disagree with his commentaries, C so. Right. What did you think of the news coverage of the war? Uhhuh. Really? <Laughter> Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your, your prior experience with the military did, I wondered if it would help you sometimes fillin the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people, people like myself might not pick up on. Okay. What weekly, F um, magazine do you look at, is it, Uhhuh. Sure. Does that give a pretty good overview of everything C or D like, does it give, F um, I guess, little encapsulated reports and, and then a few big stories? Yeah. That sounds good if you were short on time, you could get a summary real quick. Right. Right. D Well, we're working on a NEWSWEEK, F uh, for the last couple of months we got, D you know, an introductory subscription, C so, we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. C So, we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us, D so to speak. It can't hurt, <laughter>. No. I, I even, I enjoy reading T NEWS, I try to catch it because it's another example, they just, they just show you the words and the facts C and they, they don't offer any commentary, C and it gives me a quick chance to, to be caught up during the day. Because, D you know, we don't listen to the radio at work at all. C So, I don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything. Yeah, C and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is, F um, TALKING FINGERS, do you have that? You have different telephone numbers that you can dial, C and then you dial in an access code C and it will, depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update, it will give you, F um, updated information. D So, that can give you, D you know, current news updates, current weather updates, things like that C and it's, it's offered through the local phone company free of charge. C So, that's, an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use. It, It really is, F yeah, it really is nice, E I mean, because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk, and find out about. C So, that is something you might keep your eyes open for, I think it's, it's catching on throughout the country <TV>. <TV> Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an, <static> hour a day, C and then I supplement that with, F uh, radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week, and a newspaper if I have time. That's true, C and, C and how do you rate the, F uh, h, are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving? On the whole, I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts. I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. F Um, since I don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite. F Uh, I think I'm fed up with trite. There seems to be more and more of it, C and I understand the void that, F uh, comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations C and a, as expensive as they are to produce, they certainly don't want any dead airspace. I, wo, I, we're certainly in agreement there. Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done. They're, maybe they're a little more efficient, or have more to do over that same time frame. I don't know which that answer is. F Uh, I think the, my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES. Do you watch that? D Well, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs, F uh, that I knew both the people and the inc, incidences, C and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint, that was, in my estimate, nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings. C And it, ever since that time I just don't watch. F Uh, C so, I guess we have the, the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not. I don't know di, I don't know how old you are, C but it seems to me like the last, F uh, newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite. C So, I don't, I don't know if you're familiar with him or not. D Well, Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold, of Cronkite C and he did a, a pretty good job. THE HUNTLEY, BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent, over the years. D Well, once they've reported the facts, all they can offer is an opinion anymore. D Well, I almost felt like it was too much. Indeed, I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. F Uh, i, I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst, C and I don't need their fillins, D you know <laughter>. Yes, C but I, I think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh, the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going. D Well, I, I think, F uh, my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES. I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT. At one time or another I've taken them all for a year. I believe in giving anything a chance. F Uh, C but I keep coming back to that one, C so, I, that's kind of my favorite. It's primarily, F um, a few big stories and then lots of highlevel reports. F Uh, here's what went on in Asia over the past week, C and there's maybe a page of that, little brief paragraphs, unless that was one of their, the focus of their main stories. F Uh, it too is one those in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways, C and I do most of my reading in the bathroom. F Um, C and it's one of those that I can ei, read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there. C And it just seems to fit nicely, so that I can get it read in about three days. D Well, to broaden your horizons, make you think about different things anyway. D Well, anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt. F Oh, I'm with you, I have to check T NEWS every, everyday. It's my noontime dose of facts. No. F Huh. D Well, it does sound very interesting, maybe our phone company out here will get around to, offering something like that.
