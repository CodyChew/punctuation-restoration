<Clicking> F Uh, I think, F uh, D actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the, F uh, working for a large corporation. C And, for me, there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit <laughter> <child> I think it's health care. It's what, I think everybody would say that. <Bird_squawk> Right. Belonging to a group is the, belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you, <Sniffing> F Uh, so, the, F uh, <throat_clearing> sometimes I think it's more important <laughter> than salary. Yes. C And, F uh, I don't know if I would rank that second C but, F uh, since I have three boys, F uh, it, it can turn out to be important. Yeah, D you know in a, in a given year, dental ca, dental expenses can really kill you. Right. Right. It's, F uh, <Throat_clearing> Right, F uh, C and then, F uh, F uh, if the cleaning doesn't get you, the orthodony will. F Uh, I guess that would be up there. F Uh, I'm not sure if I would rank, F uh, how I would rank that next to, D say compared to retirement C or, F uh, F uh, F uh, pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great, a great benefit. <Throat_clearing> C And I, I think it's really something that the, F uh, the government ought to encourage more because, F uh, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, F uh, Germany and Japan. F Uh, Right. When you have the, when you have the, F uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has, and you can, F uh, offer some incentive C and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up, F uh, the savings and the, that you wouldn't otherwise do C and, Leave? <Throat_clearing>. <Sigh> D You know, I, I don't think so yet. They may have, F uh, just plain parental leave, which either one can take. F Uh, I, their, F uh, I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. F Uh <Throat_clearing> F uh, F uh, I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks. <Throat_clearing>. Right, C and, F uh, There, <Cough>. There ought to be, F uh, F uh, some compromise that could, where, F uh, where the person would be guaranteed <swallowing> a, F uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position F uh, in exchange for a longer period of time. It's, F uh, it's so important to families then C and, F uh, C and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up. F Uh, That, Yeah, you're right. I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I, that I would most like to see, F uh, changed <throat_clearing>. F Uh, the, F uh, parental leave. Right. Right <throat_clearing>. They do it by shortchanging their kids. There's no other way. E I mean F uh, unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. F Uh people moving as much <sniffing>. C And, F uh, they just, it's just a terrible choice, you shouldn't have to make it. F Uh <sniffing> you're right. C And, F uh <throat_clearing>, F Oh, right. Boy, would I like to have that. Yeah. <Laughter> F Oh, listen I have friends in a lot of different cities. If you just fly me there, I'll take care of that <laughter>. <Throat_clearing> Right. C So <throat_clearing> C and, F uh, I guess the, <Talking> Right. F Oh, C and if you try to get it outside of your corporation, you're going to pay an arm and a leg. Right. F Uh, do you also get dental? F Oh, I know. D Now my husband is with, F uh, Northwest Airlines C and he gets, F uh, D you know, the full health and dental C and, F uh, we have four children C and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous. C And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it. C Or maybe they don't <laughter>. That's right <laughter>. That's right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. D Well, it's a lot easier to, to save it when you don't get your hands on it first <laughter>. Right. F Uh, what about, what about, F uh, lesser, F uh, benefits perhaps for you but for, for the women in the, in the corporation. For example, F uh, <lipsmack> F oh, Yeah. Do they e, even, do they have father leaves or anything like that? <Static> Uhhuh. F Oh, I do too. F Oh, I think, I think it's just a crying shame, F uh, for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks. She isn't recovered <laughter>. C And, F uh the infant needs her desperately, at that point and time. Uhhuh. Right, I agree. F Oh, sure. Especially in this day and age. You don't want to start over again anywhere. D Well, I think they're at, they're com, they've come a long way. F Uh, at least some companies. Some of them, F uh, my girlfriend, in particular, that works for a, a rental car agency C and, F uh, as manager and, F uh, they have a very, very poor leave policy C and, F uh, I just don't know how, how women do it. Particularly, single parents who don't have the support at the other end. F Uh, That's right. That's exactly right. Right. Uhhuh. <Talking>. One of the benefits we get, of course, is travel <laughter>. <Laughter> It's wonderful <laughter>. The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere C but you can't afford to stay once you get there <laughter>. <Laughter> That's right. You have to have an awful lot of fun just, just getting there, is, has to be half the fun. <Laughter> <talking>.
