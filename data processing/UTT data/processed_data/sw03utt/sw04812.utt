<Noise> <talking> D So how do you feel about it? Yeah. I, I, myself, almost, F uh, am in favor of it. F Uh, I work at Honeywell C and I went through a, a pretty, I don't know, I went through a, standard drug testing thing before I, I was brought on. I think that's pretty standard. At least at Honeywell it is. F Uh, I think it's important to insure the quality and, and, F uh, I don't know, almost the goodness of character. D You know that kind of thing. Where do you work? F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. F Huh. F Oh, great. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. C And that, that definitely happens, D you know. E I mean those, the drug tests, sure they're accurate C but there's always that margin of error. C And that's, that's something to be aware of. Another thing is, a lot of times, D you know, they aren't that accurate. They aren't that sensitive. D Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, D you know, what are they going to do about that <laughter>. D You know, I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell C and, F uh, F uh, D you know, I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something. F Uh, I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types. Although the literature they give with you says D yeah we do this C and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for. F Uh, I don't know. What, what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? F Oh, okay. Great. F Uh, yeah, I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida. C And this is actually a <laughter> an internship up here. C But, F uh, they, F uh, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing, C so. Right. F Uh, they essentially, no I sure don't <<talking to someone else>>, <<resumes talking to B>> F uh, they essentially, F uh, they essentially, F uh, made me the offer and then, and then, F uh, did the drug testing thing after that. C So, F uh, it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of all their tests C and, C and then, they essentially give you the offer C and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that. C So, F uh, there's some noise on this end. I'm actually in a mall calling C so <laughter>. You probably wondered, F huh. C But, Yes. That's a good question. I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave, F uh, if you fail I believe they give you one more chance. They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. C But, F uh, D you know, once again, those things are not that accurate C so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail, D you know. C But, F uh, wha, are you working right now anywhere C or, Okay. F Oh, okay. Great. Yeah. That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening, D you know. Was, was going to Honeywell. A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there. C And he's doing an internship with I B M. C And, F uh, they, basically, F uh, did the same exact thing. F Uh, we both got our internships at the same time C and we both had to go through drug testing <<mispronounced>> at the same time. C So, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process. C But, F uh, No, no. That's one thing they don't do is, is drug testing while you're on the job. F Uh, I think, I think the unwritten rule is, D yeah, expect it C but they don't do it. D You know, C so. That's good I guess. I don't know. E I mean, I, F uh, I have gone to a couple of parties since, since that time C and while I don't do any drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, F uh, D you know, smoking a joint or whatever. C And, F uh, D you know, that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up, D you know. C But no, they don't, they don't really do that. C So. Yeah <noise> <talking>. F Uh, I, I don't see any problem with, with testing for random drugs. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, D well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon. C And I, I just came from Saint Paul. F Uh, interviewing with Three M. C And, F uh, they have a policy for, F uh, testing. If you, if they make you an offer, then they'll test you right before you start. C And I guess the only <lipsmack> drawback I can see to, to drug testing is in, in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, F uh, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem. C But i, Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Right. F Uh, electrical engineering. F Oh, wow. <Laughter>. They test you, F uh, before they, before you start or before you even interview C or, Uhhuh. Oh. Oh <laughter>. Yeah. Wh, what happens if you were to fail? Then do they give you D like one ch, one more chance or two more chances? Uhhuh. F Uh, no. I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and, F uh just interviewing with companies right now. Uhhuh. Oh. Did, do they test you at, right now, at work too? Okay. Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Wow. Is it formal policy that they said they might test?
