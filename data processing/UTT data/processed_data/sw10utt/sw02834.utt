Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh <laughter>. Around there, F huh. D Well, you're, you're just a youngster then <laughter>. I passed <laughter> the fifty. <Laughter> C So, I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles, C so it should be real interesting. C So, you think we're ready? Okay <beep> okay. F Uh, you want to start off? Uhhuh. Very much, yeah, yeah. Yes. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think all things get started sometimes in that manner. D You know, they come in that way. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I hadn't thought much about that, C but that is true. That, Uhhuh. Some of them. No. No. Uhhuh. Very much. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Not, no, they, they hurt themselves a little bit in that way. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. There you go <laughter>. There's a lot of truth in that. Yeah. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. Yes, it shouldn't be destroyed. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. D You know. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. I think now when both are working they have a more ch, more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Because you get set in your ways C and it's, really hard because to, to really to get help. F Uh, d, D you know to get the work load shared. Yes, uhhuh. Our, I, we have five children, they're <laughter>, They're all grown and on their own C so, They're, F uh, F Uh, how do you mean that? <Laughter>. F Uh, we have, F uh, two girls and three boys C and our, our baby girl just had a baby girl <laughter>. Last week was her first baby. C So it's been real exciting. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Have you been that way long? Just eight years. That's, that's a long eight years, though. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That makes a big difference. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes. D Well, probably your role C and, C and the way you are also has changed, though. D You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. The best you can, yeah. I, yeah, that's the only thing I worry about is the, the child's love and security. That, I think that's being damaged, F uh, a lot. Uhhuh. I do, too. I, I think, F uh, D now some, some women can, can do both. They're very capable of working C and, C and, Uhhuh. It, it really is, yeah. Uhhuh. C So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems, C or they say they do anyways, C and, C but I think ones that don't have to, the, it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there. D Well, that could be. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Uh. Yeah. Yeah. You mean it's stronger there? Much stronger. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah. F Uh. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. C But they're both, Yeah, they're both different people, too. That's, That's where the trouble lies. Some people, some people can adjust and have both, do both well, C and others can't. F Uh, D well, F uh, I have one daughter that works fulltime. She has two little boys. C And, they seem to do fine. She has been talk, has talked about quitting, D you know, and staying home for a few years. C But then, it's real hard because she's got an excellent job. F Uh. F Uh, basically I'm at home C and I have two cats and my husband, E I mean my husband's great. It's wonderful, D you know, C and, C and, F uh, C so I'm about forty and whatever, C So, yeah. Yeah, I'm just a spring chicken, I guess <laughter>. D Well, Righto <laughter>. I think I'm ready <laughter>. D Well, let's see, the changes I've seen in women's roles, F uh, since I am in the forty age, I'm a fifties baby F uh, C and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very, very wide, F uh, it's been a big change. Very much, C and I think you'll have to agree C and C and since we were in, F uh, sort of the ground level, the bra burning of the sixties, C and, C and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be F uh, C and I think, D you know, it got off to a really radical, it has a radical fringe to it that, F uh, I've sort of backed away from. Yeah. C And, to make a change, D you know, you have to make a splash. C But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas, C but I really do think that women have made a contribution F uh, to human beings, E I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions C and it's okay C and I think, F uh, D you know on the other hand, I don't know that men have changed that much. C So in, in contrast to the women's changes, F uh, D you know, the men stay steady, C and then the women change around them. F Uh, I think men are trying. C But they don't have a national organization of men, to, F uh, help them out C and F uh, what's changing them, though, is the economic situation, where both team, it has to be a team partnership now, C and they both have to work C and they both have to raise the children, if we're going to have any kind of future at all, C and, C and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years. D You know, the me, F oh, I don't know, the, the yuppiedom, the whatever it was, the, D you know, women didn't know how to go about doing the careers C and they wanted to compete with men, they wanted to be like men, C and that's wrong. I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men, men <laughter>, Absolutely, C and so that's, D you know, they sort of threw the thing back another, D you know, ten years, that they've had to, D you know, restructure, C but I saw the greatest Tshirt the other day, I got to get some for all my men friends, it says, let men run the world, women have more important things to do <laughter>. Right. C But, F uh, I think men and women both have valuable, valuable assets to offer C and, D you know, we shouldn't, we were made differently, however you come to that conclusion, we were biologically, physiologically, made differently C and there is great wonderment, in that, C and, F uh, D you know, we should respect that in each other C so, Right. C And, C and, D you know, just sort of all s, swooshed into one channel sort of thing, it's, it's viva la difference <laughter>, someone said that C and I think that you can truly respect the other person, E I mean, D you know, Tom is just always saying, what a mystery you are, D you know <laughter>, D you know. Depends, Yeah. D Well that depends on what day of the month it is. C But, F uh, I don't know, I guess we've gotten more of a, in, in terms of that, I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles, C and, C but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles C and, Yeah, D well, that's, that's a very different way to do, D you know, the woman doesn't start off at home, raising the kids and goes back into her career, D you know, twenty years later. F Uh, You do. Yeah. Are, are you married? Do you have children? F Oh, my goodness. F Oh, my. How did you do? D Well, E I mean, okay, D well did you have boys, girls, how did, how, F Oh, my. F Oh, my. F Oh, how exiting. I, I tell you what. I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids. I just love the babies C and, C and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that, it's, Just eight years, just the most important years of my life D you know <laughter>. Yeah, it has been. C And, F uh, C so there have been major, major adjustments, C but that's another story. C But, D you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps, E I mean I, I couldn't ask for a better life. E I mean if this is the way it had to be, this is the best way, I could possibly do it C and, C and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and, and his being able to, D you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things that really, C so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort, of thing <laughter> C and, F Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. E I mean, boy, E I mean I, I would have had so, I had so much guilt to begin with C and the changes that had to take place, D you know, where I couldn't do a lot of things and, F uh, just adjusting to that, that, F uh, D yeah, that was a major change, C but C so, I guess <breathing>, F uh, in the end, D you know, you each take your own situation and you, and you deal with it the best you can, C but C but, C but women I think are a whole, D you know sort of riding the course, they're, they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there, I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation. I think, we're going to see a generation of kids that, D you know, are just going to be a little bit, F uh, <lipsmack> F oh, not very nurturing. I think, Yeah, C but I wish they weren't so many, I, I wish they weren't role models for everybody, because it's so dangerous. It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that C and then when she can't, D you know, the failure of that is, D you know, her life sort of falls apart C and she doesn't know who she is C and she's, Absolutely. D Well, D you know, I think that's, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in. F Uh, I, I would almost just say that because, D you know, down here in the south D you know, a woman's role is, a woman's role, sort of thing, C and D you know, F Uh, F oh, yeah, yeah. C And, C and I think that, F uh, <lipsmack> D you know, career women still have a lot of problems here, with the good old boys, here in Texas sort of thing, making career moves C but, F Uh, D you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, F uh, it's just like the way it, it has been for years. E I mean, D you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here. That's the woman's role, C and it, C and it's hard for her to, F uh, D you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes, C but then I'm not there, C so I don't know that. C And I have women that do both C and I see a little jealousy on the part of, D you know, the woman what has two little boys C and, C and she has an au pair, which is a livein college kid working for her C and then she has her business in the back C and then my other girlfriend that has, D you know, just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy, all the time. C And so I see I little bit of that C and I always wish there was a balance, D you know, with the one and, and wish she could spend more time with her kids C and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge, for a while <laughter>. Get some peace and quiet. Yeah, definitely, C so. You're right about that. Yeah. C And that's, That's true. That's so true. How, how did your daughter do it? Uhhuh. Right.
