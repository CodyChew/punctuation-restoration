C So what movies have you seen? Uhhuh. <Cough>. Yeah. I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, F uh, HOME ALONE C and, Yeah. It is. It is about a little kid that, that his parents go off to Paris. C And they, they forget all about him. The oldest daughter, they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of, C And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble. C So she made him go sleep upstairs. C And there is, there is a couple of burglars, F uh, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood. C And, F uh, Yeah. C And he sets up traps for them all over the house. F Uh, he does. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, it is six dollars, C and then C but you get, F um, matinee prices. C But, Uhhuh. D Well, I think they are a lot better than they us, than they were, D well, D like, F um, in the early eighties or the, during the, D like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era. When it was, they, I do not think they were very good during that time. At least there were not as many good ones. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And it was shocking at the end too. C So, Yeah. Yeah. That is right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Especially JAWS. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Just more of the same. In one of them they have a mother shark, F uh, destroy a whole, F uh, marina and aquarium. Which is kind of far fetched. Yeah. <Cough>. Uhhuh. They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well, F uh, every once in a while, I go, <noise> but it, it has to be D like somebody that I like C or, D you know. I did not, I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good. C And then when it was, I, I found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on, F um, I guess A B C the other week, then I, Yeah. C And then I really liked it. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah. It was really, C and then, C and then, F uh, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player. I thought they made him up, and then I found out, D you know, after I saw the movie that, they, they started talking about that scandal C and, Yeah, when the, when the anniversary came up that was around the time of anniversary, D you know. C And then it was on the news. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C And I wondered who it was too. Huh. Uhhuh. F Uh, I d, What is that? INVISIBLE MAN? F Uh, no. Huhuh. F Uh, did they make the movies after that C or, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Okay. It was n, Nice talking to you. Byebye. F Uh, D well, I have, F uh, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the, the best movie that I have seen lately. F Uh, I do not go out to films very often. C So, as far as out of the house. C So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in, F uh, C and I see some that way. C But, F uh, I am not real current on films. How about you? I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet. Yeah <sneezing>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, cute. F Oh, dear. Uhhuh. F Oh, F Oh, C and he hears them or something C and, <Laughter> Who wins? F Oh, great, great. Yeah, I had heard people talk about it, C and they say it was really cute, but I had not seen it. F Uh, we usually wait C and ev, eventually it comes out on video, C and then we get it and see it that way. C And that is, it, movies are very expensive. F Uh, movie theatres here, they are six dollars, F uh, for evening performances. C And that is kind of steep, I think. I don't know. How much is it in Dallas? Yeah. You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, D you know, F uh, that is taking the middle of the afternoon. C And if I am looking for entertainment usually I, I, have more, F uh, time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to, F uh, see things. What do you think of movies in general? As far as the, as the trends? Uhhuh. Yeah. Did, Yeah. The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect. F Uh, the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a <noise> tougher rating. Which suggests that, that, D you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public. C And a lot of times it is added for no real, F uh, valid reason. F Uh, which does not make, C and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that. F Uh, C but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added. It was just all legitimate kind of, F uh, film. C And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars, F uh, C because it really was good even though it is such a long movie. D You know, they said, "Oh, people won't, won't be interested in a three hour movie." But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone. F Oh, F oh, yeah. Absolutely. F Uh, but much more true to life C and I think that is, that is the point. F Uh, they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good. I hate sequels too. I hate these, F uh, D you know, number one, two, three, four. Usually if a movie is good, once is enough <laughter>. <Laughter> Right. That was on Prime Time Television here, F uh, recently at seven thirty in the evening. C And, F uh, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie, F uh, at that hour. C And I thought, that, D you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, F uh, E I mean when they were young. C And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V. F Uh, which was a, it was a good movie. E I mean it was well done but, F uh, that is one reason why it was scary. C So, C but I do not know that I have seen any of the, F uh, sequels to that. I think one is enough. F Uh, <<faintly>>. Yes, uhhuh. That is what people say. Oh. Yeah. It, just a touch. <Laughter>. D Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched. C But, E I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched. Not, not too often <laughter>. That has gotten to be a whole camp i, idea now though, D you know. If you hear that music, D you know, everybody knows what you are talking about. It's funny. D Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. I saw it then too. Yeah. It was good. It was very good. C But, F uh, F um, F uh, D see I have, F uh, teenagers in my house. C And of course sometimes they rent movies and, D you know, have friends over or something. C And sometimes movies are here that I did not, I am not even aware that I could have seen, D you know. C Because my family tells me that, that, that it had been actually in the house before <laughter>. C But I had missed it. C But I did see it on T V, C and I thought it was good. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. No kidding. F Oh, I did not realize that. Yeah. F Uh, D you know, the character that, F uh, James Earle Jones played? F Uh, F uh, I teach in school, C and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison. C And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him. F Uh, I do not know, I had not heard anybody talk about it. C But, F uh, he certainly could have been. F Uh, A which was kind of interesting. D You know, someone who, F uh, who was a real activist but then took up the cause. F Uh, kind of gave up, D you know, because he did not think anything was happening, C and C so, F uh, it was kind of fun. I do not know for sure, C but there are certain, F uh, qualities that suggest it could be he. C Because they were, F uh, they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse. That he had stopped writing and had stopped, D you know, C and that is true for Ellison. He, he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it. F And, F uh, has pretty much dropped out of public life. C But he is still alive C and that, D you know, that is what makes it so interesting. C And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN. INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison. It is an incredible book. It, F uh, really is very, very interesting. I highly recommend it. F Uh, the, yeah, the movie, the in FIELD, FIELD OF DREAMS came out after, F uh, that novel. C So i, it could easily have been patterned after him. C But the, the movie did not have anything to do with, with the story that I am talking about. C But I just thought the act, the, F uh, author could have been patterned after that, F uh, E I mean th, that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly. Sort of interesting, C so. D Well, I guess we have talked probably our l, time limit, haven't we? Okay. Very good. It was nice talking to you. Okay. Byebye.
