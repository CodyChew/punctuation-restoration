Okay. Where, where are you from? F Oh, okay because I, F uh, I talked to a professor in, F uh, what was it, North Carolina, who got the, the T I system, C and he gave to all his students. C So, my daughter's even talked to, C and I've talked to several people from North Carolina. I was just curious. Have you, too? Yeah. I talked to the professor, C and I asked him about it, C and he said, F Oh, he says, I think I'm the guy that, D actually, F uh, gave it to all my students. C So that's why so many people are from this college. Go, ahead, you, you first, Eve. Food. F Oh, great. Yeah. We have them too, C and I, I'm trying to think which is the, best, F uh, that I prefer. F Uh, my wife, F uh, doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it, F uh, C and we haven't catered out very much, F uh, we, I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be, the man always gets that chore, C and you, have to make it perfect. F Uh, I've made shish kabob, which I like. It's fairly easy and fast. F Uh, where, I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for, for having, F uh, F uh, dinner. I do cook, C but not, I'm mostly the easy cooker. D You know, the breakfasts and, and the steaks, F uh. Although I would like to experiment with, F uh, the meals my mother made, D you know. So to speak, C and I haven't gotten around to that yet, F uh, D Well, she was Polish C and, F uh, she would make very economical ra, meals. We were very poor. Different rice and ham and things that, F uh, she would throw things together and galunkies and all that. C And, F uh, I would like to try that one day. C And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and, and special meat balls and everything. C And my wife, of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too C but, <Laughter>. Yeah. C But dinner parties are a lot of work, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that, that, shish kabob is, F uh, just because it only takes a few minutes to cook, D you know, you get it ready, you have to do a lot of work beforehand, I agree, and buy special stuff. C But, F uh, C so far as getting out there and, and putting it on, it only takes a litt, a few minutes, F uh. C But D anyway, I'm, I'm thinking of the easy way, rather than, my guests, I guess, C but, F uh, Right. Right. Uhhuh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Right. You'd get the odor of it, yeah. Uhhuh, yes. F Oh, great. F Oh, yes, we probably ought to try this. C But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered. I guess it gets better and better as we remember it, back, as we get older, D you know. C But we probably should try it, F uh, to do that. The recipes are really interesting, D you know. We're probably going to lose them C and we'll probably forget all about them, D you know. Since we're trying to make everything so sim, here I am talk about trying to make everything easy, D you know. I, F uh, you talked about Thanksgiving, there are interesting meals at different times. F Uh, something, s, my wife's from Texas, C so, F uh, I remember we were first married C and we were living in New Jersey. C And, F uh, we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas, D you know, to have a meal. C And we were on the way over, we were just married that very year, C and she said, F Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey. I said, Turkey? I said, We don't have turkey at Christmas <laughter>. I said, We only have turkey on Thanksgiving. I said, We're going to have a ham. She said, What? I said, Yeah. I said, No, turkey is only for Thanksgiving. C And C because she had turkey a lot, D you know. C And, F uh, that was surprising in the, in the east, F uh, we always had ham, D you know. A, C and, C and that's one thing als, that's another recipe, I guess, we could talk about. D Now the hams just kind of, D you know, go take it out of a can or, F uh, F uh, a package, sliced, F uh, the cans were cooked for hours and hours and, and were just wonderful, D you know. I, I'd like to try that too. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, I saw them. That's good. No, I, I, F uh, I've, I know about Sam's. My wife I think goes C but, Uhhuh. F Oh, really? F Oh, I haven't heard of that, yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I'll have to ask her about that. F Uh, because we have a delivery guy that comes around, that sells, I'm trying to think of his name of it. F Uh, F uh, I don't know, F uh. I see a can here, or a box here of Gourmet Choice. F Uh, he delivers, F uh. What is the name of this thing? I got a box, distributor, marked on it, it doesn't say, <<very faint>> Gourmet Choices. C But he, C but it's a company that has, F uh, D you know, a truck that comes around. C And, C and they recently had hams. They have steaks and, and, F uh, D actually, pirogies and all that stuff that, F uh, I, I wish I could tell you the name of the company, C but I don't know what it is. C But, F uh, they recently had a ham, that was supposed to be, it was boneless C and we tried it. It was real nice, C and it was fully cooked and everything. We had it for breakfast a long time. It was really great. Yeah. I would like to try the old recipe though, of cooking it, C and, C and I keep saying this, F uh, to, to do the different things that we did. C But I would like to put one in the oven, D you know, the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours, and see if, C because I don't think in, in my married life, which is, F uh, twentysix years now, we've never done that, D you know. C And I remember that when I was a kid, F uh, to have the ham cooking. F Uh, rather than that, we just, ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally, D you know. C And that's it, D you know. In the old days, we had, hams were the meal, C and I don't, I don't think we, really have it as a main meal. Right. That's an interesting point. How, how have you changed your, your meals now? Have you, into that, F uh, looking at those things? Uhhuh. Parents, that's unusual. F Oh, yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. D Well, that's amazing, they'd go, that they have started. Usually it's the younger people doing it. Yeah. I, F uh, my, my wife's mother is the only grandparent left, C and, F uh, she has high cholesterol. Of course, I ha, I have too, but not like hers. C And I always get after her about salt and everything else. C And she just will, E I mean, she's going to eat the same way she ate, D you know, her whole life. C And she just tells, more or less tells me to shut up, D you know. C And, F uh, I like to, I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way. F Uh, F uh, it's, it's not the . I listen to, F uh, Larry Newarth on the weekend. He's a fitness expert C and, F uh, he talks about, D you know, the chicken and the rice and everything else. C And, C and, F uh, throwing away peanut butter and all the things <laughter>, D you know, the things not to eat, D you know, ever. I think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever. C And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk. D You know, try that sometime. My wife says she can't stand it. C But, F uh, when I make scrambled eggs now, talking about a recipe, I, D say if I have four eggs, not, not for me, C but if I'm making four eggs, F uh, even for my daughter and I, I'll take out all the yolks but one. C And C and it's fine. You, you don't miss it, F uh. In fact, when I, when I make eggs for myself, if I, if I fry them, throw them in there, I will almost hard fry them so I can take, not eat the yolk at all. C And you don't really miss it. You get the flavor of the yolk, C but, F uh you don't eat it at all, D you know. You don't, they're hard. You get D like, F uh, a bite at, at the m, most. C And so, F uh, for cholesterol, E I mean, I'm trying that. C And it has worked. My cholesterol gone down twenty points. C So, although, I haven't gotten on the, which, whether yu, butter or cholest, not cholesterol, margarine and all that. I don't know, know, whether any of that is true, D you know <<fade out>>. Whether the margarines or butter, F Um, just here in Dallas. Uhhuh. That's, yes, yes, that's true. I've talked, Uhhuh. People from Virginia and, and all over. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. F Um, D well the subject we're supposed to be talking about, let's see, is, F uh, food. What type of foods do you cook C and what would you, F uh, cook in, F uh, F uh, let's see, if you were giving a dinner party? C And the only reason why I may know a little bit about this, is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon. C And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, F um, F uh, cooking for people. C And, F uh, if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and, F uh, you don't have to do all that much work. D You know, you just, F uh, slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce <laughter> and away you go. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. What kind of meals did she make that you liked? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. No. Sounds interesting, uhhuh. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, yeah. C But, F uh, that's, that's why I like the, the outdoor stuff a, a lot better. People can entertain themselves, I think, a great deal more, F uh, when you have a barbecue. Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and, F uh, D you know, nothing really fancy, like your, your shish kabobs, where you have to do a whole bunch of work. Uhhuh. Right. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I, I think you do, do a lot of work. Even if people do bring over things, you still do, F uh, all the, F uh, housework and get ev, everything prepared and utensils and just, just everything. F Uh, D you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish. I'm thinking about, F uh, special dishes, C and, F uh, yeah, it was made out of rice and consume soup, F uh, and bacon and onions. C And then you'd simmer it D like all day long. F Oh it would, Yeah. C And it was just, it was just wonderful. That's, that's something that I would really like to, F uh, to try and find the recipe for. C But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time. Because you can, you can put it on top of the stove, and do this, C and, C and there's so much broth and juice in there, that it has to, F uh, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it to, F uh, F uh, to come out fluffy and, and nice. C And that was, D you know, when you were talking about the, the Polish dishes, F uh, some goulashes and things like that. That's, F uh, that's what I thought about, was that Armenian rice dish. <Laughter>. That's true. That's true. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah! Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. You know what I found was, at Sam's, F uh, Wholesale F uh, stores. C And, F uh, what they have is this honey baked ham, They, have you seen, have you had any of those? If, if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, F uh, twenty dollars, for, F uh, I don't remember how many pounds it was. C But you cook it in the bag that they send it in. C And all the juices and everything are all sealed in. C And, I tell you what, i, it's never failed to come out tender and juicy, and just and just delicious. Because I normally don't like ham, because it's so salty. C But with this honey bake that they have, that, that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse. It is absolutely delicious. C And it slices great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Wow! D You know, that sounds like it. C But that's, that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy. Wow. Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. That's true. I, I don't think so anymore, not with more, becoming more conscious of, F uh, fat and cholesterol and, and all those good things. F Oh, yeah. D Well, my parents actually started it, C and, F uh, getting, D Well, it, it's true. I think my parents are very unusual because, F uh, we grew up in the south, where, F uh, you have all the, F uh, D you know, biscuits and gravy and, F oh, fried foods galore. C And then gradually they started switching over to, F uh, plain rice, F uh, no gravy. It's just, it really is. They, F uh, they're actually, they actually, F uh, F uh, led us through it, versus, F uh, us teaching them, D you know, the, F uh, the finer points. C But my mother has really high cholesterol, C so it was one of the reasons which started them off. C And they started doing this, like in the early, E or in about the middle seventies. F Uh, yeah. It's true, it's true. I agree with you. C So, it's really neat. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Wow! Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow! F Huh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow, that's good. Uhhuh.
