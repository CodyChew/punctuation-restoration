Okay <laughter>. No. I had to press one. <Laughter>. Sure. Uhhuh. I think we should have stayed longer. F Uh, I think what we did was good, C but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do. Yeah. I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now. C And it's almost like they're killing each other off C and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all <noise> <<sounds like zipping>>. D Well, I think, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, F um. D Well, no, I just mean that, that, the world in general <laughter>. Yeah. F Um, I don't know, I think we should have helped the, the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more, than, rather than just quitting where we did. Yes <laughter>. C But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible. F Oh, D see, I haven't really been keeping up with them C so I really don't know what he said. What did he say about it? Uhhuh. We don't have the money for that. <Laughter> It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes <laughter>. <Beep>. E I'm sorry, I dropped the phone <laughter> <noise>. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. . <<Voice is distorted.>> Uhhuh. F Oh, I didn't realize that. No, huhuh. Only in Ohio. I've never been past Ohio. No, huhuh. I've never seen anything out, I never seen the great, I've seen, I've never seen, I've seen pictures of it C but, I've never been there. I've seen pictures, I just, I'm a college student C and, F um, I'm paying for my own education C and I'm, I come from a large family C and we, we we're never able to take vacations because there's, there's twelve kids in the family. C So, F Oh, my. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, I'm, I'm originally from Butler C and that's about an hour away from where I am now. I'm at Clairon. C And, F um, it's, it's pretty, D like, windy and hilly. F Oh, I couldn't even tell you. It's not like a mountain. It wouldn't be like a mountain. It's, F uh, F Oh, I don't even know. I have no clue. <Laughter> I would say it's closer to sea level. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, D see, F um, <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. F Uh, the farthest away from home? D Probab, <sigh> I'd say five or six. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my <laughter>. F Oh, my Gosh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. D Now D see for me, that's a long ways. Uhhuh. Even, D well, D like, I, I'm in D like a little town right now. It's smaller than Butler C and, F um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh. C So that will give you some idea of where I'm at. C And I'm about, I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh. C And, F uh, E I mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town. The college, without the college here, this town would be nothing. It would be absolutely dead. C Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants C and, C and in the summer when we co, F uh, my fianc3ee's family lives up there, we come up here in the summer, C and it's, E I mean, there's just no one around. F Um, D well, I go home in the summer C and I work in the summer C and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college. Finance. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, D well, like I said my fianc3ee, No <laughter>. No, no, no, F um, my fianc3ee works down in D C C and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something. I'd rather work for a company and, F um, D like be their financial advisor or something. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Take a boom a little bit. D Well, D well what would be the unemployment rate out there? D See that's what it is here too. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs. I know people they are out of school for two or three years C and they have a job that has nothing to do... Was I supposed to do something? Good <laughter>. F Uh, let's see, C so, F uh, were we right in the Middle East? Should we have been there? Did we do what was correct there? Should we have fought them harder? Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used? F Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, F uh, Drive on into Baghdad. Would that be so bad? Was there anything there to begin with? It wasn't ours. We've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue. I agree. Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country. Yeah. C So other political things that's going on. I heard Mister Bush say, E excuse me, President Bush say that he, F uh, wanted to improve the highways. <Cough>. F Oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country. C But wouldn't it be wonderful. And back east, you all drive at fiftyfive, don't you? What's that? F Oh, okay, F um, I say back east you all drive at fiftyfive don't you? D See, out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fiftyfive we drive sixtyfive. F Oh, yes. D Well, I, F uh, last weekend, went home to visit my parents. My dad's in the hospital. C And, F uh, between here and west Texas, there was probably three and four hours at sixtyfive miles an hour. Nonstop. Have you ever been out here? How far west have you been? F Oh, you've never, You've never seen the great American desert. The Rocky Mountains? Yellowstone? F Uh, D Well, my college educa, F uh, thirtysix, worked for Texas Instruments for <breathing> seventeen or eighteen now. F Uh, D know, virtually nothing else. F Uh, yeah. I got my four year, got my B S in General Science. Yeah, I know, it's a funny degree <laughter>. Anyway, F uh, I know nothing other than the west. In fact, F uh, down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things I don't understand. Trees and the gulf C and it's really interesting. D So tell me about where you live. F Uh, how high is the highest elevation? D Like, F uh, probably three thousand feet? Close to sea level? Okay, F uh, right here in Colorado Springs where I live it's over six thousand foot. <Laughter> F Um, yes when I lived in Texas, every year I had to drive, D you know. I drove every year to the gulf C and, D you know, C so I could have a feast of fresh seafood six, eight, twelve hours away. D You know, just, just for fresh. I, I'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America. How many hours have you been from home? Yes. F Oh, yeah. F Uh, now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas, look at your map later and see the, the town of Amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle. To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour. When I was growing up, Now things are different C and people buy jeans in town, C but F uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours. Yeah. It is I imagine. Okay. Okay, I'll look at my map later. Wow. How neat. C So are you working your way through college? D Well, how neat. What's your major? Finance. D Well, that's interesting. D So, F uh, what do you plan to do with it? Savings and loans, F uh, F Oh, that would be great. That would be neat <breathing>. Let's see, F uh, D so we're all excited in Colorado Springs. Apple Computer is coming to town. Yes. The, F uh, new employer is in the city. C So we're expecting our local economy to <breathing>, D Well, maybe not a boom, but, F uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still. F Uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent. C But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent. C And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree. Yes. It is.
