<Laughter> F Uh, the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative. C And I sell family products. C And, F uh, C So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot. Do you work outside? F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. It's kind of nice to relax a little bit. Yeah. D Well, my, my dress up, I live out in the country also C so what I wear depends on the weather. F Uh, C so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up. C But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes <Lipsmack> which I try to wear something easy to take off, D you know and put on. C And I don't too often take off my coat even, C so, F uh, I really don't have to dress up like y, you would, like if you're in an office or something. F Uh, D well, not actually because we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather. Yeah, C and the rest is, F uh, gets into the cooler weather. Uhhuh. Course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here <laughter>, C so I don't know. C But for now, C But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, F uh, cold weather. And that type of thing. D Now, my daughter works all the time, C so she dresses. I think, D you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job where you work. Uhhuh. F Um, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Right, yeah. Did you find you wore, F uh, slacks when you were working full time C or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts. No slacks. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even if it's all, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I know my daughter mostly, I don't think she ever wears slacks to work. C But I didn't know if the trend changes, D you know, if, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Look more like a woman, F huh <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Uh, D well, then you, you, you know why they make them then <laughter>, that way. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. C But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I, I believe, F Oh, you don't think you will, F huh <laughter>? D Well, you'll be excused because considering everything <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But I, I look at homemaking as a job also. F Uh, being a homemaker C and I, I think sometimes we lose sight <laughter> of that. F Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress, F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Do you, D Well, I, I work, F uh, I'm a C P A C and I do contract work. C And so, C and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice C and I work with him a couple days a week C and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up C but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever <laughter>. C So that, that makes it pretty nice. It's kind of weird because before I used to work, D you know, full time C and, C and, F uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about. Right. Right, C and so it's, F uh, some of my suits I haven't put on for <laughter> quite a while. C So it's, It's, it's very nice. Gosh, Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I imagine that where you live, F uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year. Not really? F Oh, is that right? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So you all are waiting for that <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. D Well, down here it's sunny most of the time. And, F uh, usually warm. E I mean, we had a few cool days, F uh, this month, C but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had so far. C So, E I mean people are still wearing shorts C and C and, F uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler, C so you start D you know, breaking out a coat at that time, C but, that, that lasts, D you know, for a few months <laughter>. No. No, never wore slacks. It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them. It was one of those understood things that you just, D you know, C either wore, D you know, a dress C or, Not, No, not, not with what I did. F Uh, Most people didn't. Sometimes, D like the secretaries might C but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much. C And I really, D you know, there's some nice pantsuits out C and C and I wouldn't have mind, minded, D you know, wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold. <Lipsmack> C But, F uh, Uhhuh. D You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional. I guess they expect women to be in skirts <laughter> or dresses. Yeah <laughter>. That's right <laughter>. C And it's the men that make the rules <laughter>. <Laughter>. C But, no, we usually, D you know, skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here. C So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants. No, no one can see me unless I'm, D you know, g, Yeah. Yeah. C But, I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing <laughter>. Right. Yeah.
