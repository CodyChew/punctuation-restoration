D Well Amy it's been, F uh, kind of overcast today and cloudy. We have, our, I have a son in kindergarten, he was having a kite day, C and I was really worried about it raining because it has, there's been some dark clouds C and it's been, F um, <lipsmack> C and it's been pretty rainy looking. Uhhuh. I know it just has that, I, it looks, several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not, not done anything. C And we have a lot of trees in our yard C and I probably, they're pretty old, big tall trees, C and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah <laughter>. Because I really have to catch some sunshine or else I feel like I live in a cave all the time, Uhhuh. F Oh, I bet. Yeah. That makes a big difference C but I, F uh, we're kind of new to Plano C and I'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school C and I'm thinking that this has been <child> pretty, D you know, rainy season, C and it's been kind of scary, it's kind of been sc, cloudy every day, C and <children>, I thought, D well, I'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather. D Well, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, I know in, F um, I'm from Missouri C and we always had pretty nice four seasons C and, C and D you know, ex, we have some extreme weather in each season, C but, F uh, I like that C and we moved here from Houston in, in, F uh, July C and everyone kept saying, F oh, you're going up north it's not going to be so hot, it's not going to be so humid, Yeah, that has just not been the case. It has been, F Oh it was extremely hot, I thought I was going to die, my car, I thought it was going die last Summer C but, D Well, the air conditioning was broke, C but broken, I guess it just couldn't handle, the stress, and the heat, the record heat, C and, D you know, I was worried about every time we came to an intersection <laughter> the car started idling rough, D you know, because of the extreme heat. Uhhuh. F Oh, I know. That's really awful, C but, C but I, F uh, understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season. Uhhuh. No. Sure. Brown. Yeah. That is, that is awful C and it, it takes time C and the, the kids, they, you have to water your lawn C and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy, D You know, C so you're going do I want a di, a green lawn or a muddy feet <laughter>, in the house. F Oh, no <laughter>. D Well, I don't know, do, the nice thing I'm looking forward to is, F uh, not having a hurricane season. <Laughter>. Yes, we always had, F uh, big concern about hurricanes, C and they're close enough to the coast C and, D you know, you had to have a supply like, F uh, emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season, C and, C and it was pretty spooky <laughter>. because you always have to think, D you know, what's the weather doing, Right. C And do we have enough, D you know, F um, <lipsmack> food storage, and enough, F uh, batteries and all the kinds of things. That's right. D So, Uhhuh. D Well I, D yeah, I don't really like tornadoes either, C but, F uh, at least there isn't, we fe, I feel like I got rid of something, hurricanes, C so, not too much of that. Yeah. C and it is, C and, I just, I can't believe the, the record temperatures that have, were here last Summer that, F oh, it was just unbelievably hot. <Laughter>. That is pretty bad. F Oh, I know. I can't imagine. Even, D well, that would, it is just pretty bad, C but I guess, F um, <lipsmack> I guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston C and, C But it is, like you say coming a little bit further up north. It's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season, where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows C and, Uhhuh. C And get some fresh air in the house C and, it feels good C but, C but, I guess, No C but I remember, <Breathing>. F Oh, no. D Now, that sounds awful. D Now, I have seen those. I have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be at little yellow signs, it's, D you know, has it like from one foot to four foot C and I thought I would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street. Yeah, that would be awful. D Well, I've got some kids out on the trampoline I need to go look and see what they're doing. D Well, you too. Byebye. Yeah. F Oh, boy. Yeah I've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week C and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within fortyeight hours, C and so I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain, it's going to rain, it's going to rain, C but it really hasn't rained <laughter>. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter> D Well, I get tired with the ki, I have two ki, preschoolers, a three year old and a two year old, C and if it's not nice and they can't go out, it's really the pits <laughter>. C But I appreciate it <child> when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something, D you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, my three and half year old, he really wants <children> to have the pool out in the backyard <laughter>, D you know any day, E I mean all Winter long <laughter> he's been wanting a pool in the backyard. C So, I'm hoping, D you know, that, it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to, D you know, muggy, and hot, C and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixtyfive or seventy degree weather with sunshine D you know? I really miss that, I'm from Chicago originally, C and I miss the seasons that, D you know, that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here. Yeah. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, really yeah. It's pretty hot here during the Summer <laughter> gosh. Do have air conditioning in your car C or, Yeah. . Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and he, when he comes home from work, D you know, during the Summer he's just wa, he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour <laughter>. Gosh. Yeah. What I hate is, I hate having to water so much around here D you know, we never used to have to water our lawns D you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there C so here if you don't water it just looks awful. I just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass, D you know. Yeah <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, we have a dog too C so that adds to it D you know, traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there C so, F Oh, yeah, because Houston was really hurricane alley, wasn't it, weren't there a lot of hurricanes there? F Oh, boy. Yeah, that would be, Gosh. Keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that? Yeah. Yeah, D really, every time I store batteries, I wind up going to use them and they're dead <laughter> they've been stored so long. <Laughter> F Oh, boy. D Well, now this is a little bit of relief, although they still have warnings all the time around here for, D you know, tornado season hurricanes and stuff, C so, I, Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I've been worried about mostly with having <child_talking> little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up, E I mean I have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn C so, Yeah. a hundred and ten degrees C and, C And I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that, I just don't even want to go out, D you know, of the house to get the mail even <laughter>, leave me in the air conditioning. We had our air conditioning broke, break last <laughter>, last Summer. The switch got something wrong with the switch C and we had to call somebody out to fix it, because I couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's really nice I hate having to leave the house clo, D you know, closed up all the time. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, have you been here during the real heavy, heavy rains? E I mean I can't remember what time of year, I think it's usually this time of year when we get some, just torrential down pours. Gosh flooding. Our neighbors had flooding, so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year. They had to replace all their carpeting and everything, it was miserable. Yeah. That would not be fun. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, really. F Oh, gosh, no kidding. Talk about asking for trouble, F huh? Yeah, yeah. Okay, D well, have a good day. Thanks. Byebye.
