All righty. What type of home do you have in Dallas? Uhhuh. F Oh, good <laughter>. C And it's probably typical of your neighborhood. I'm in Plano just, D you know, north of where you live. C And, F uh, we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago. C So, my home is typical. It's a, a brick home. A two story brick home, C and it's typical of t, of the other homes in our neighborhood too. Yes. Yes. The, the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling, we're from the north C and we just couldn't stand the wasted space, C so we had them, we have a high entry hall C and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to, F um, nine feet so we could get bedrooms above. C So, that way we, we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area C but we don't have so much wasted space. C And we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way. Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood. Yeah. Yes. Right, I know. Our air conditioner, during the summer we, it's over three fifty a month. Yeah, just to aircondition it, C so. I have, F uh, a master bedroom and a den on the main floor, C and then upstairs I have three bedrooms C and I have, I'm a writer C and I work in my home C so, above the garage area I have a studio. C So, it's not really a bedroom. It doesn't have a closet C and it, C and it's the size of a three car garage. C So, that's where I work. Yes, yes. C So we, this is our dream home, C and we just absolutely, love it. I, Yeah, we're, we're really proud of it. I just hope we never have to move again. This is al, <laughter>, F Uh, Detroit this last time. We were there two years C and, F Oh, we love it. Yes, C and they're much, much better constructed down south than they are up north too. The, Uhhuh. The quality of the workmanship, we noticed a tremendous difference. Up north they just kind of throw them together. Because we had homes built in, in Detroit also, C and they just didn't care. If the trim work didn't line up it's just, that's just what you get <laughter>. Oh. Yes. D Well, the carpenter and painter and, D you know, everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built, C and they'd say just look at this, C and D you know, <Static> they seemed so proud of everything they did. C And it really made a difference <static> to us. Yes. Oh. Yes. Uhhuh. That's important too. Uhhuh. Oh. Yes. Yeah, ours is pretty much level in the two years <static>, that we've been there. We're hoping it takes off again, C but I don't know with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in up on Legacy, we're hoping that brings in <static> more people. That's what we're hoping because, we're, we're just real close to, to where that is. D So, Uhhuh. I hope so too. Yes. Yeah. Yes, I'm sure <laughter>. For that reason it can stay the same, C but <laughter>, C But we love being where we are. Okay. We have a, F uh, four bedroom split brick home in, in Richardson D actually. C And, F uh, we bought it back in about nineteen seventythree. C So, we've seen it go up in value wise real well <laughter>. Yes <laughter>. Yes, yes. It, it looks like all the others. It's, F uh, Uhhuh. F Oh, I know where that is. Yeah. Yes, you're in the, the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings, C and, uhhuh. Thou, those are lovely. Oh. F Oh, nice. Yes. Have you, F um, found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings? Are they? Uhhuh. D Well, I would expect so. I have wondered about the cooling and the heating. Especially the cooling. Wow. Uhhuh. D Well, how many bedrooms do you have in your home? F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, how nice. F Huh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's a pretty good size room. That's neat. <Laughter>. D Well, it sounds like a real nice one. Right. Where did you move from? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do you like the Dallas area? C And I would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are, F uh, a much better value down here, aren't they, than they are, F Oh, really? D Now that's interesting. Uhhuh. That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes, D you know, are that good down here. C And, F uh, C so that's interesting. <Laughter>. D Well, that's good. D Well, I know as I, as I said our house is about seventeen years old C and, F uh, we've been very pleased with it. We've had no major problems with it. Knock on wood <laughter>. C And, F uh, D you know, it is with, F uh, with the, D you know, two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it, all the time. C So, C and we like our neighborhood. It, it, has, has grown C and the majority of the people, D you know, keep up the neighborhood. C And that's very important C and, C and as I said it, it has ris, risen in value. C But we bought back when housing was so low, C and, D you know, C and now i, D you know, i, then it started jumping by leaps and bounds. It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit, C but we're still fine. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes <laughter>. It should bring up your property values a little bit. Your pricing. Uhhuh. I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves, I think the housing will go up. D You know. Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs, and everything C so that's, D you know, that keeps prices down and value down C and I'm sure the packs, F uh, or would like for it to go up. <Laughter>. That's right <laughter>. That's right <laughter>.
