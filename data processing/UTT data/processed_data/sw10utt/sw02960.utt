D Well, do you watch much T V? Your kids. How many kids do you have? F Oh, goodness. I have got two. That is about all I want <laughter>. Yeah, they do. They are still babies. F Oh, D well. We have only get two channels. We do not have cable. C But I am not crazy about T V much. It just, D well it kind of is an idiot box. D Now SESAME STREET is a good program because, F uh, I do have that on videotape, C and I will let him watch that every once in a while. C And he has learned to count to twenty from that. C So, Yeah. Uhhuh. Okay. Right. Right. C But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do. Yeah. F Oh, I love QUANTUM LEAP. F Um, yes. That is a good show. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. He always got to change history is what it is. Usually, yeah. That it is so good. I was glad when they put that back on this channel, because like I said, we only get two channels because we do not get cable. C And still my little boy, he watches videotapes. He won't, F um, this is terrible, I do not like him sitting in front of the T V all day. D Well, It, C but it is a not really a good baby sitter <laughter>. It is really not. He needs to get outside and play. C And he is four years old, C and he just does not like to go out there by himself. C And I will let him watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done. C But other than that, I do not like him glued to the T V all the time. Huhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, we made the mis, Right. We made the mistake of getting ROBOCOP. C And that is one of the worst, F oh, I do not let him watch it anymore. Because the, the pieces, D like especially where they kill somebody, it is just not good. E I mean it is just real violent. E I mean, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You would see somebody get shot, they would just fall down. Yeah. So graphic. Today it is, it is really graphic. They try to make it too realistic. C And, Yeah. Now he is watching HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS right now. It is, it is cute. C And that, little ROGER RABBIT on before that. That is cute. C And they have got THE HE MAN, F uh, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, the movie. That is a real cute show. HE MAN? Yeah, good versus evil. F Huh. F Oh, D well, it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. They do have D like those parental control things on the, F uh, remote controls. D You know, where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch. Uhhuh. D Well, my, my, F uh, stepfather and them have, my stepfather, my fatherinlaw, and them have that. C And, F uh, they do not have any kids, C but they was told how to use that. C But still, when the kids get older, they learn how to break through that parental control. F Huh. I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons. C So, it is, it is, I am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because, now we have got a lot of western tapes. JOSEY WELLS, now he loves to watch JOSEY WELLS. Yeah, Clint Eastwood. C And like THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER, we have, F oh, my husband likes westerns. C And he also likes STAR TREK. D Now STAR TREK is good movies, good shows. The, F uh, series? We have got a lot of those. Uhhuh. THE NEXT GENERATION? Yeah. My little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk. C And my little girl has Mister Spock's ears <laughter>. <Laughter> I told my husband he cursed my kids. They were both born with pointy ears. Not real pointy. My little boy grew out of it. No. Kirk Douglas? F Oh, Michael Landon. F Oh, now there, Yeah. Like HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN? <<Speaking to child>> Here are some cookies, Kyle. <<Resumes talking to Speaker B>> Yeah, I liked HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN, <child_talking> C and I, C and I thought that was kind of neat though. C But I loved LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up. She was kind of like my idol <laughter>, when I was growing up. Because I am twentyseven, C so it is, D you know, she is about the same age as I am. I wanted to be just like her, because she is so cute. Yeah C and, D well, I liked it, C but there, that is about the only, F uh, show I have seen where every time they sit down at the table, they pray before they eat. C And I thought that was real neat. Because there is not a lot of shows that do that. <cough> C And, F uh, they have this little cartoon that is on Sunday mornings with, Jot. I remember him in school, C but I do not, it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes, C and his parents are there. They have it D like before one of the church things, F uh, D you know, church that comes on? C And it is a just this little dot. C And he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home, C and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that, C and, It is just, D Well, it is, usually we go to church on Sundays. C But we will miss every once in a while. C And I will let Kyle watch that, C and he just, D well, I even like Jot. E I mean I, it is funny. It is on channel, D well, let us see. You are in Plano? F Uh, it is twelve or ten down here. F Oh, D well, this is of the mornings. F Uh, around nine or ten I think. It is before one of the, I think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs. I think that is the one that it, F uh, comes on before. It is real cute. You know what? He is bouncing around, C and his name is Jot, C and then he has got a friend named Cat. C And I think the dog is the only one that is not a, a dot <laughter>. <Laughter> C But it is real cute. C And like I say, they, they teach him stuff from the BIBLE. C And I think it is just a real cute show. I am trying to get my little boy into reading, F uh, like church books and things. We have got like NOAH'S ARK and, F oh, LORD IS MY SHEP. We have got about eight or twelve books for him, just little Bible stories. C And they, he is, he is getting to where he likes them. We got him a little Jesus doll, F uh, about a year ago, C and he has always kept that. He likes it <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So it's a, a Christian songs? F Oh, that sounds fun. That's something. D Well, Yeah. D Well, I watch in the evening with my kids <TV>. I have four children. <Laughter>. D Well, Yeah, it keeps you busy, doesn't it? F Uh, my children like to watch SESAME STREET. I watch with them every once in a while, C but that is not my favorite programs. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. It can be very educational. There are shows th, that I like. F Uh, I like good family shows, F uh, though. F Uh, I let my kids watch things like LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. C And the COSBY SHOW is, F uh, is, F uh, kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money. I think that sometimes the things they show on there though, F uh, the problems that their kids get into, are, are good to, F uh, show that they do have problems anyway. F Uh, Yeah. E I mean, like I said, real life is not that easy. C And, F uh, I watch a show that I like i, for entertainment. F Uh, it is called the QUANTUM LEAP. I watch that show every time, C and, F uh, I, I like, F uh, how the, how he has to help with the people that he, that he becomes. F Uh, because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone. He has to do something positive to help them. C So I, Yeah. Yeah. It, Me too, me too. Uhhuh. No, that is not terrible. I do not think that is terrible at all. <Laughter> D Well, Uhhuh. D Well, I do not think it is, it is healthy all the time either. F Uh, C and my kids like to, to go play with their friends, C and so I guess I do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit. D Now I, there are shows, I do not have cable either. C And there are shows that I really put my foot down on. If there starts to be a lot of violence, I do not go for that. I will not let them watch that. If there is a lot of language or, Uhhuh. D Well, it, <sigh> D you know, today I watched, C and it is like they show bloody, D you know, things, C and they show it in slow motion. And, and everything like that. C And before, in a western or something, in the, in the olden days, Yeah. C And they were gone <laughter>. C And, C and it was not, F uh, not like today. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. Too much realism I think, sometimes. I don't, F Oh, that is a fun show. F Oh, I really like that one. Uhhuh. The cartoon or the, F Oh, uhhuh. That has good moral values too. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I think, F uh, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. At least we have the same ideas. Yeah. Language too. A, language and violence and sexual, y, D you know, things. I, I get kind of, F uh, saying, "I am sorry kids, this is", C And I, I think it is important that I see what they are watching. If, You mean in cable? F Oh, I do not know, because I do not have that. C But, Uhhuh. F Oh, do they? <laughter>. They are too smart. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I think that is a good show too. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, I think not even the old one but the new one too. I like both of those <child_talking>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, d, <laughter>, Yeah. F Oh, D well. F Oh, that is not a problem anyway, C but it is fun <laughter> to, D you know, seeing the show anyway. F Uh, now I like, F uh, everything Mi, F oh, no, not Michael Douglas, F um, F oh, I can't think of his name. No, the, the man, right now who is having, F uh, who has done, F uh, BONANZA, and then he did LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. Michael Landon. There you go, Michael Landon. I have always liked and thought he did good shows. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, C and I liked that show because it, it portrayed, I thought, really well, F uh, pioneer kind of days. D You know, C but, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Now what is that? Uhhuh. F Oh, I have not seen that. Uhhuh. What channel is it on? Uhhuh. D Well, I will look and, and see. Yeah, we go to church on Sunday. About one o'clock is when our meetings start. C And, F uh, It is in the morning? Okay. W, D Well, we'll look. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I really like, now we get channel fiftyfive, although we do not have cable, we do get channel fiftyfive. C And that is a, F uh, like, a, a song, they sing songs on there C but they're, F uh, worship through music kind of things. C But they are up to date, F uh, C and some of them are D like, F uh, videos like music videos, that go along with the songs about church and Jesus. C And, C And I, Yeah. The Chri, it's called the Christian music station or something like that. C And, F uh, I really like that. F Uh, I turn that on, on Sunday mornings. C And I do not, D you know, C and so my kids do not, F uh, have an <TV>,
