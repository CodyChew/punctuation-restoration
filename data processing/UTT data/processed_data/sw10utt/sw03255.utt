Okay, for as far as, F um, I would think the, probably the, F uh, worst substance that's probably, F um, E or, started to say the, F uh, what causes the most air pollution is probably the car C and, F uh, whether or not, F um, they'll ever get into D like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, F uh, train <laughter> or, or something like that C or, Yeah, that's exactly it, C and that's what we're finding, F um, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that, C or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, C so it's, it's kind of a thing where, F uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool. Uhhuh. Yeah. Exactly. Uhhuh, or if somebody gets sick. Yeah, C or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck, you're definitely right, C so, Yes, Uhhuh. Sure. Sure, that happens quite a bit, Yes, yeah that's very true. F Uh, other than that, F uh, I don't know, Okay. F Oh, okay, <laughter> we'll try to be real quick here. The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk, Five minutes, F oh, okay. Minneapolis area, F Uh, D actually no. We have, F uh, quite a bit, F uh, the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get some pollutants such as those, C but those are natural F um, C but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, C and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, F uh, lead into the air or other pollutants, C and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed, at least where you. Sure, yeah, Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Uhhuh. Sure, sure, Exactly, Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Yeah. Sure F uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, F uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it C but it's uncomfortable C but, F uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, C and one of the cans <laughter> released entire amount of freon into the, F uh, into the air because he opened it, C and, I don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that, C and I was thinking how many other people F oh, sure, C because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, F uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars C so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, D Hey, that's that's right there. I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can C and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car, C and I, I thought about that, C and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it <laughter> C but, F uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that C and, Uhhuh. Exactly. Pump, yeah, Probably so, Yeah, it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility. Uhhuh. I think so too. I'm in Texas C and very few people carpool F uh, the people that I know don't want to because, F uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, D you know, they just feel they need their car. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. C And people don't want to give it up C but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and <noise> <<telephone click>> and to change the car itself C but, F uh, D you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent C but yeah. D Well, my other line is ringing C but we're going to ignore it <laughter>. I'm sorry for these beeps, F Oh, close to five minutes, I believe. C And you're in Minneapolis, D Well, is the pollution really bad up there? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well that's the way it has gotten here. We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas C but, F uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that C and, F uh, C but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed C and D you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C s that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use F uh, they can't use, D like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business C and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst, systems therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twentytwo freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed C and, F uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C s into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, D you know, C But, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. It's probably happened to millions of people, Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh Yeah. Inhaled so much of it, uhhuh. Yeah, D well, of course in the, F uh, I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
