C So I've been concerned about crime lately. F Uh, it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems. I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh <laughter>. No, F um. D Well <breathing>, we moved in, when we moved in, there, there wasn't any outside lights C and so we've been trying to install some, F uh, outside lights C and we put up a fence in the backyard. Mostly, D you know, not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in, but that our children would be safe playing in the yard. D You know. C And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids. It's scary to send them off down the street a few houses <laughter>. To let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything D and so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them <laughter>, walk down the street and, say, call me before you leave and come back C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, no. That's a good thought. <Throat_clearing> D Well, we've been real lucky that, I don't believe there's been, D you know, much trouble in our neighborhood, C but it C but it does seem there, that there is a lot more here in Plano of, F uh, just bored teenagers <laughter>. Vandalism. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and they don't, F uh, I know my sisterinlaw who lives in our neighborhood they've had their, they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and a few things like that C and, course, D you know, <breathing> I don't know <laughter>, I'm getting scared for kids to get older, C because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who, and, or is it just random crime, C but, F uh, we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the, anywhere that they live has had, been a victim of, D you know, a serious crime. C But, F uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen C but it doesn't mean you'll be safe C and, C But, I guess I take a lot of, F uh, little bit of, F uh, <lipsmack> safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, D like drug related or <Breathing> F uh, things that, places usually that I wouldn't be going. <Laughter> And things I usually wouldn't be involved in. C And, F uh, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to, C but it is scary. Were you raised in this area? Uhhuh. C So, has it been getting worse that you noticed, or about the same? F Um. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Right. Right. Take a lot of chances. D Well, I noticed that, F uh, that, F uh, when we, we moved here from Houston not too long ago. C And C so, of course, we were interested in schools C and, F uh, C but the schools in Houston all have big, tall fences around them C and they're not really very safe C and C so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all <laughter>, around them, C and <inhaling> it's just a whole different idea that, that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school. C And in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school. C And C so that's been something that's been good for the, D you know, in this area that you feel like, F uh, D you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings <laughter> at school today. <Laughter> C And I guess, I don't know how people live with that every day. Pretty scary. C But, anyway, D well, I guess I won't take up more of your ti, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I, I think we have a neighborhood watch <laughter>. I think. I'm not real, we don't get real involved. We're never home, C so F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, D well, I know they were going to start one, C but, F uh, I haven't heard any more since, C so I don't really know. C But as far as personally doing something, no. How about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. F Oh, I'm sure it is. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. F Um. I would, too, if I had kids. We don't have any. We did install a, a <lipsmack>, a, F uh, motion detector light back in our driveway. C And that was, mainly it was so when we pulled up, the light would come on, C but also we have a boat back there C and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief, C so we thought with that light, D you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something <laughter> to the boat <laughter>. Yeah C so, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. We live in, Coppell C and, C and that's pretty much what it is, is D you know, kids that are bored, like you say. Uhhuh. F Oh, no. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, I know it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Really is <<faint>>. Yeah. I'm originally from Chicago, but I've been in this area, in the Lewisville area for, F uh, D let's see, about twentythree years. <Laughter>. F Oh definitely. In the last few years, I think, C and, F uh, like I say, D now I don't think necessarily in this area here, but just Dallas in general. I don't know, I think back of when I was, F uh, younger and in my party days, some of the things I did, D you know, I wouldn't be caught dead, like, being out that late at night. <Laughter>. In the dark parking lot <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. <Lipsmack> I don't either. Yeah, F um.
