F Oh, not very many of those at, F uh, sometimes I, I play the trumpet, C and sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces. C And then I have a five year old daughter C and we cut out things, kind of, D you know, and color and, F uh, and, F uh, use markers and things like that. F Um, how about you? Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah, exactly. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I don't know. My, my father is in the, in the antique business. C And he, F uh, he goes around to garage sales C and he buys all kinds of, F um, china and figurines and statues and stuff. C And, F um, there's some stuff that's really for, F uh, auto repair. It's called J B Weld C and I repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once. C But he, mixes colors in it. It's an epoxy resin that you mix together. C And he makes like, the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small, it's D like about maybe the hand's about the size of a cricket. And, F uh, has, F uh, D like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out, C and he was repairing that, C and, F uh, it came out pretty good. It's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and and, F uh, has some age spots in it, C and it looked, D you know, just like it, it had been there all the time. C And he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, F uh, molds that in. He had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way. It worked out real well, too. C And then, C And C and then he, F uh, he thatches, F uh, D you know, those, F uh, thatched chairs. Course that's like that, that, F uh, hooking that you were talking about. That takes a lot of time. Yeah. C And he used to paint, F um, a long time ago, C but I think he's stopped pretty much now. C But outside of, outside of art class in, in school, I, I stopped doing most of that, unless E I, I mean, D like he has a computer, C and I use, F um, the graphics F um, software on that, <Noise> <Sigh> <<pause>> to, F uh, to do figures and to look at things, D you know, see how they work. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, sometimes, C but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors, C and we had, F uh, an entertainment center we did last year. F Uh, we <talking> bought it at an, unfinished, F uh, furniture place and sanded it down and, F uh, stained it and then lacquered over it <Talking>. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh, sure is. Did you use a, did you use a Zar stain? F Um, <<pause>> they had a, F um, D well I saw the commercial on T V, C and they, C and, F uh, C and the people at the unfinished store recommended it, that's called, it's Z, A R <<spells out>>. C And, F uh, it spreads real evenly C and it doesn't dry too fast, C so it's, if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out. C And F uh, we, put, we put tung oil on it. Kind of made it sticky for a while. C But after it dried out, it was, D you know, it was real hard, C and it was all right. Yeah. Uhhuh <noise>. Were you in a, were you the Girl Scouts, too C or, <Noise>. D Well, it was nice talking to you. Okay, you too. Byebye. <Noise> <<TV or radio>> Okay, what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. In, D well I used to be more into crafts, when I was younger, like high school stuff. I was in four H C and I did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff. F Um, C and, F uh, I've learned how to crochet, C but I don't really know, E I mean, I don't do it that much. Not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad. I'd rather be outside. F Um, I used to play trombone <laughter>. I don't know if that was a, not really, I don't play it that much any more, C but I, F um, what else do I do. Mainly do reading. I don't have a lot of crafty type things I do. C But, F uh, <<pause>> what are some other things you enjoy? Uhhuh <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. F Oh, cool. F Oh, wow. Uhhuh. F Huh <sniffing>. <Sniffing> Uhhuh. Do you ever, F Huh? <Noise>. Yeah. Yeah. That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff. Oh <sniffing>. Yeah. Right. That sounds interesting. F Um, does, does he ever, F uh, refinish furniture or anything like that? Uhhuh <sniffing>. Pretty time consuming, isn't it? C But, it's g, it's nice to have it when you're done, E I mean, looks pretty. C So, I've done that once C but it didn't come out that well. F Uh, I don't remember. It was, I had my parents buy everything, C and I ended up, it was their table, their kitchen table. It came out really dark. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Sniffing>. I remember it took me a long time, it took me like several months, E or several weeks to do it during the summer, C and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking. Since I've moved away <laughter> they've had it redone. C So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick. C But, <sigh> I don't know. <Sigh> Like I said, I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff, C so <sniffing> C but during Four H, E I mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in, interesting, I like that <Sniffing>. No, D well, yeah when I was real young I was for a couple, of years <sneezing>. Excuse me. C So, F uh, <lipsmack> D anyway, it was nice talking to you Dudley. Have a good day now. Bye <Noise> <<TV or radio>>.
