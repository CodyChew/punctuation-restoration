D Well, D basically, F uh, did you want to go first, then? Okay, right. Uhhuh. Sure, uhhuh. Yeah. I think as far as, D like, our home, it's, F uh, in a small residential area. We're out of the cities quite a ways, C so it's kind of more of a country setting C and, F uh, <baby_crying> it's just a typical, F uh, three bedroom type of home. It's, it's nothing, D you know, <baby_crying> elaborate where it has, F uh, this or this or, D you know. It's, it's just a typical home with, F uh, three bedrooms, F uh, two story type home. F Uh, C and I think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, F uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are. F Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's, where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, D you know, pretty typical of what our home is, C so it's, F uh, pretty much that, F uh, type of, F uh, home C so, F Uh, Uhhuh, F oh, really? Sure. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. C So it's the rambler style. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like what ours is. F Uh, one of our bedrooms is really small C and we've made that into a den because we only have one child, C so that was our best way of going with, F uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller. It seems like they get incredibly small <laughter>. F Uh, C but, F uh, D anyway, C but, <lipsmack> okay. C So that sounds great, C and, F uh, I don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever. The T I? F Uh, yes, F uh, about three times before. I'm fairly new to it, C but <breathing> it seems to be going okay. No, huhuh. No, I'm out of state. I'm in Wisconsin, C so, Yeah, yeah. C So it's, <Breathing> F Uh, other than that, sure, yeah. Is this your first time? Uhhuh. I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of like it because it's like I can get it done with <laughter>. I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls, D you know, so, sooner or later. Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay, D well, you take it easy, Gail. Bye, now. F Uh, D well, I can. I, I don't own my home. F Uh, <laughter> E I mean I, I live in a nice area C and I rent my home C and F uh, we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here. In, F uh, Texas, C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh Yeah. D Well, our ho, our house, we, we're renting it from an individual who bought it C and he lives in Korea. C And, F uh, <baby_crying> he's recently moved here C and he's owns eight or nine properties F uh, near here C and, F uh, C so, C But the houses around here, there's five, five houses on my street for sale right now. Which is just, F uh, in trouble <Breathing> to me. C And they're not very expensive either. It just seems like, we have a three bedroom house. Ours is one level only. F Uh, C but we, Yeah, we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen C and, The bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger. C So, Yeah. Have you d, have you done this before? Uhhuh. F Oh, have you? Yeah. Are you in Texas? No, yeah, F Oh, really? Oh. Sounds interesting. No, huhuh. I've, D well, I've gotten several calls. F Uh, C but, F uh, Yeah. Yeah, yeah, D well, they've, I've talked to some people from Cleveland C and I did talk to someone else who lives here in the same city I do, C so that was kind of interesting <laughter>. They're, they're sure getting their people out, C so, D well it was nice to talk to you, anyway C and, Okay, thanks. Byebye.
