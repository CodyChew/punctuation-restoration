Okay, it's pressed. Are you still there? Okay <laughter>. C So what's, F uh, things that you look for when you go out to dinner? Uhhuh. F Huh. F Um, that sounds pretty. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, we don't go out to dinner that much either. We try to get out maybe D like once every month and a half or something like that, C but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, D you know. F Um, I've been to some that's been terrible. D You know, you see cockroaches crawling around and <Laughter> everything, D you know. C But I try to get one that's nice and clean C and then I like to, D you know, good food and good service. C So. Yeah, right. Right, right. C So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um. F Um, that sounds beautiful. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well. This is only a little small city. F Uh, we have, F uh, <cough> E excuse me, <cough> I didn't think my coughing would come back. D Anyhow, we have only D like one, F uh, restaurant that's kind of nice. D You know, they have prime rib on, F uh, weekends C and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city called Wesley, C and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food, C and the atmosphere there is really, really nice. D So, C and then if we really want to, D you know, something different we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away. C But, F uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city <laughter>. Do I have kids? D Well, I have a son, C but he's grown up. Uhhuh. Yeah. All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they, D you know. No, no, I'm sure there isn't. Uhhuh. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, let's see, what else can we talk about? <laughter>. F Oh, it's foggy and cold here. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah C and it's. I came from Iowa when I was sixteen C so I've lived out in California for a long, long time. Yeah, I like it real well. We used to live in Oakland, C so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there D you know, C but, F uh, then I quit work and everything C and I bought a house. I had a condo in Oakland, C so, right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants Chinese restaurants, C and they were really good, I really miss them. D You know. F Uh, no, I really don't miss living there. I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while, D you know. C But, F uh, as far as missing living there, no. It's close enough if I wanted to go there, to San Francisco for dinner or something, why, D you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and D you know, have dinner and then come on back. C But, F uh, have you ever been to California? F Oh really? F Um. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. . Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'm ready <laughter>. F Oh, I just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere and of course good food <laughter>. That's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax, D you know because I don't really go out to dinner that much, C so. Uhhuh. Right. Oh <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, where you don't feel rushed, D you know C and you can just relax, and stay as long as you want. D Well, nearby. We're almost in Dallas. We're just north of Dallas. C So we have quite a bit between us and there. It's about ten miles C and there is all kinds of restaurants C and, I had one that was a favorite for a long time, C and then it changed hands and doubled the prices C and then it finally went out of business. D So, C but it was really nice. It had a fireplace. Yeah, it was really nice. They had entertainment sometimes C and you could just really relax there and enjoy it. C But it's gone <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's nice. Uhhuh. Right. That is probably very fortunate for you. Do you have kids? Yeah. F Oh, C because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, D you know, C and now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers, <laughter> C so something's happened here, C but, C but, F um, D you know, McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list, C and I hate these places. Uhhuh, they do, C and I don't think there's an ounce of <laughter> nutritional value in anything they have. D Well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around C and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work C and you're tired C and, D you know, you just are tempted to give in to that, C and it costs a lot of money to do it too. D You know, it adds up C and it's not healthy, C and I really got into that habit for a while, C but I got out of it again because I just felt like it was just too unhealthy. C So. <Laughter> D Well, how's California today? <laughter>. Is it? That's what I've heard, yeah. Have you always lived there? Oh. C And you like it? Yeah, we've been. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, that would be fun. Yeah. Do you miss living there? No. Yeah. Yeah. F Um. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, I go all the time. Yeah, D well I have a twentyone year old daughter in college there C and she, F um, is a world champion twirler C and her coach is in California. C So she went there for six years. C So I went out a lot with her. C And, F uh, yeah, I know California pretty well. C And I love it, C and we tug back and forth who's going to move, C but I think he's going to move because I'm the person with more to lose here. I have my twelve year old in school C and she's happy. She always lived here in the south, C and I have my house, C so I have too much to lose,
