Okay, basically I can tell you that I like just about every music there is except for, F uh, F uh, real hard, hard rock, I really can't get into that C but I go from classical all the way to, F uh, jazz and country and F uh, soft pop, F uh, C so I pretty much have a, a wide range of, F uh, what I like, C and just, there isn't any particular music that I enjoy more than just listening to all kinds C so that's about it. I can even take the D now, it's, it's pretty neat music that they came out with, C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, sure, the old, old stuff that came out, I think it was, A was it, F oh, D jeez, A came out with some of that, Hank Williams, you talk about twangy. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, the old, old country, Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's the way I am, too, C so, other than, F uh, as far as instruments, I can go from piano to the saxophone. Lately, D you know, with the new music that has come out, some of the really good, F uh, music they have the saxophone playing, C and it's so funny, because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself. <<Talking to daughter>> D Oops, are you okay, Tiana, come here honey. <<Resumes talking to caller>> F Oh, my daughter just fell. F Uh, yeah, a little bit. I can, I can pretty much, <<talking to daughter>> F Oh, it's all wet, Tiana. <<Resumes talking to caller>> I just wiped, F uh, did the floor, C and she slipped. D Anyway, C but, F uh, F um, yeah, I can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get, like I said, into the real hard rock, Yeah, I have no interest in that, I, I don't have interest of losing my ears, let's just put it that way, hearing, anyway, Uhhuh, sure. Uhhuh, exactly. <Child_talking> Okay, D well it was good talking to you then. Okay. You, too. Bye now. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> I'm pretty much the same way, C but there's D like certain types of country western I can't handle that twangy stuff, <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> My inlaws listen to the kind of music I hate <laughter>. The old, real old, yeah. C But other than that, I like pretty much everything. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter> Do you like Kenny G? Uhhuh. On, no. Uhhuh. Yeah, the heavy metal, <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, I saw Peter Townsend on T V last night, C and he said he's lost most of his hearing <Laughter> C and I thought, no wonder <laughter> C so. F Um. D Well, same here. You all have a good day. Byebye.
