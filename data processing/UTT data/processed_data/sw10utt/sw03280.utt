Okay. F Um, I very seldom read a newspaper. I get most of my news information from T V. Mainly, F um, if I'm really wanting an indepth thing I'll watch C N N. C And I find it one of the best. C And, F uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, F uh, channels eight or five. C And, F uh, where do you get yours? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS C and, C and my husband, F uh, he reads it cover to cover. C And, F uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, D you know, here you need to read this C and, F uh I don't know it, I kind of quit reading it, F oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers. It just seems like I was so busy all the time, C and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, F uh, things like that C and so I coul, C and it got so depressing <laughter>. Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news <laughter>. Yes, yes. I, <laughter> I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there <laughter>. I'll go through and read it. F Uh, C but I find that I do better with, F oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, F uh, the T V D you know, C and, C and they kind of capsize it and everything C and watch, C and I think sometimes it's, D you know maybe a little biased, D you know i, something C and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts. D You know. Yes. Yes. You found some members of your church that had been murdered? F Oh, the same type of church. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. I used to, F uh, C or I didn't used to C but, F uh when my grandchildren had, F uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level. C And I thought that was very interesting, C and I thought that was very important for kids. D Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, F uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words D you know, that they could understand what was going on. C And, F uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that. The oldest one he's nine C and, F uh, he would particularly enjoy this been a couple of years ago. C And, F uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting. D Actually I even understood it better <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, <laughter> D you know. C And, F uh, C but as I said, F uh, I ten, D you know, I, I have kind of a blas3e attitude about, F uh, news and news reporting which is, is not good, D yo, you know. Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world. Yes. We like channel eight. We like it. It's the best. Is that been your favorite? Uhhuh. Yeah, I very sel, C and I thought it was very interesting, F uh, channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen C and, C and going on. They were having news coverage C and, No, it was channel nine. C And, D you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening. C And so we had the T V on C and we were trying to catch all of it, C and they were showing some C and I was watching, my husband and I were watching it, C and then we switched over to channel eight, C and the difference in coverage was unbelievable. I can understand why channel eleven is, F uh, D you know, why they're kind of behind. Did I say channel nine to begin with? No <laughter>. Okay. No, chan, <laughter> channel eleven I meant. <Laughter> I was thinking nine to ten. C But channel eleven, Uhhuh. It, F uh, C but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, D you know, switched over to channel eight C and they didn't e, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, mostly from T V too. I u, <breathing> usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty <laughter> C and six sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines. F Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS C and, F uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, <breathing> read it, <breathing> D you know, C but not very often do I read the whole thing. Quite often just scan through the headlines <laughter> C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. If there's something, D you know, that I want to know more about or som, might be the Killeen murders. I've been kind of intrigued. I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone <laughter>. You just, <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Right. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's true. I wanted a little more detail D like, D you know, they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were. C And I guess you just, D you know, you you just want to know C and with interest, D you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different. C And that made you even feel a little more kin to, <laughter> to what was going on. D Well, D you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also C so. C So that was interesting, C but I enjoy the news. I, I think our seven year old even e, once in a while will sit down and watch it with us, C so. No. Uhhuh. Huh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Yeah, <laughter> that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that. Right. <<Very faint>> Right. F Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it C or, Do you? F Um, channel five for some reason has always been <laughter> the one I watch. I, I don't know it's probably the anchors. They just kind of catch you. I don't, I don't know. Uhhuh. The C N N, is that what that is? Huh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. That's why I wondered. I don't get that channel <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That is if you, if you want to go to bed <laughter> early it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes, C so.
