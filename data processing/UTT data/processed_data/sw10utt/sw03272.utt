Okay, I don't, do you have an opinion on that, on the U S R? Uhhuh. Sure. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Sure. Sure. Sure, that happens. Uhhuh. Sure. I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war. F Uh, they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together, C but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S. F Um, because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation. F Um, from what I've been hearing is the U S, F uh, S R has been, F uh, almost bankrupt for years C and it's people are desperate, C and there might be a revolution within the people. C But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, F uh, there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision. C So, I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses, F uh, you get these small little, F uh, places like Iraq and all of that, that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses, F uh, a small, F uh, E or as big country of U S S R. I, I, I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally elat, D you know, it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time. C So, E I mean sure <noise> they have weapons to kill us over and over and over, C but to them that would be a suicide C and they, C and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people. C But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of, D you know, doing whatever, F uh, for their country, they'll do it. F Uh, <Noise>. Sure. Sure. Uhhuh, sure. I have a daughter that's frustrated. She's on a, a stool that she can get up on C but i, if she can't get down on it it's like, get me down right now <laughter>. C But D anyway it was really good talking to you, C and you have a good weekend. Uhhuh. Thank you. Bye now. D Well, <breathing> the, <lipsmack> I think I'm, I'm skeptical about the whole thing. F Uh, and a, still a little bit worried about them because of the his, the history of Russia. C And they're in a, in a state of flux right now changing, F uh, e, F uh, changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress. C And even in that situation, F uh, the, it seems D like to me from what I've read in, in the history of Russia and, and D you know different authors, F uh, there has always been a paranoia <laughter>. They've always suspected everybody C and C and that's why they put, D you know, that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years, C and that's why they put a lot of people to death. Yes, C but Stalin was a, was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than, F uh, D you know, the Russian army killed anybody else. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, you're a, I think you're right. There's a little more craziness down there <laughter>. F Uh, the Russian people I think are not that much different from us. You know I think they're, that it would be the leadership that I, I, F uh, mistrust. Yeah. <Laughter>. You too. Thank you. Byebye.
