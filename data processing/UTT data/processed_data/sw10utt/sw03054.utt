Okay <noise> wow, I don't know what that was. I don't know <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh, F uh, we have not camped in any of those places, in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped, C but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, F uh, Daingerfield C and in Texas that is where we camp basically. F Uh, They are very nice. Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp. It has a nice little lake C and it has some really wonderful, F uh, sights that are in the wooded areas. F Uh, the facilities are quite nice C and our children liked, liked it quite well. F Uh, the kids are, D well they are quite a bit younger than, C and D you know they, we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area. C And, F uh, it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp. F Uh, D now Daingerfield is, let's see, I think that's a little bit mor, more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is. No, I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it. At any rate it was, it was very nice as well. C But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think. C But, F uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, F uh, had done a lot of camping in Michigan, I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially, C and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains, C so, F uh, my parents were real avid campers C and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well. C So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally <laughter>. Do you have a large tent C or, Uhhuh. C And how many does it sleep, F uh, comfortably? Right <laughter>. Yeah, D Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, F uh, we invested in some stacking, F uh, cots, D you know, that were like bunk, bunk beds, C but they were cots, fold up cots. That really gave us a lot more space, F um, floor space C and, <sigh> so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around C and, F uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day C so that was real nice. C But, F uh, we, F uh, D like, my inlaws also had a camper, or, F uh, a pop up tent, D you know, one of those trailer tops C and those are really nice too. A little more, F uh, luxurious, so to speak, <laughter> but not much <laughter>. Yes, uhhuh. It's really nice, in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, F uh, and the whole business. It was quite nice in that respect. <sigh> F Uh, C and everything was very convenient C and you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car, C and that was nice. <sigh> C So, F uh, do you have plans for, for any other camping trips in the near future? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, yes. Yes, yes, I have been in that area. That is a really pretty state park. F Uh, just, we did not camp there, C but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area C and it's real lovely. It's close to the lake and close to, I think it's close to the dam up there C so it's, it's really quite pretty. F Uh, are you, F um, let's see what was, I was going to ask you something else. F Oh, do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to? Yeah, uhhuh. F Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas? I, I would, I have never been there C and I would love to see what it looks like <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. How interesting. I guess I never heard the history of that. F Huh, D well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go. We are talking about starting camping again in the fall. F Um, our children are both grown C and, C and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things. C And so, F uh, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see what it looks like. Yeah, yeah. Is it? F Uh, yeah, I think so. Especially with, F uh, F uh, when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty, especially in East Texas, it's really nice. C So, F uh, <sigh> D well, I, F um, I have enjoyed talking with you. C And, F um, have, F uh, some happy camping trips <laughter>. Hope you get to those places you have talked about. D Well, okay, thanks. Uhhuh, byebye. What was that? C And, F uh, to, F uh, <throat_clearing> the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park. Uhhuh. What are they like? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Sigh> <noise> Yeah, it was a nine by twelve. Uhhuh. D Well, there, D well supposedly, they always say it sleeps more than it does. C But th, they, it would have slept three adults anyway. Yeah. Right. Di, do they have a kitchen in them? Trunk of your car all time, right. F Uh, maybe, F uh, maybe back to Caddo, or, F Uh, Purdis Creek. C Or, I like Bob Sandlin too, it's a new park. C And there is, F uh, not really camping, C but, <throat_clearing> F uh, what is it called, Cedar Hill. Lake Joe Pool. C And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma. F Oh, fr, from those three, just, just, F uh, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best. Yeah, that's right. It's not, it's not very deep. C And they did build a dam on it, C but it was there before they built the dam. It has been there for a hundred years. Apparently, an earth quake caused it. Yeah. Yeah, it's really nice. C And I, I don't know, probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas. Right. It was nice talking to you. . Yeah, you too. Bye,
