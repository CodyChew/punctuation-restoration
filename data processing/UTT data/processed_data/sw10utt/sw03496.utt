Okay, do we just go ahead? Okay. F Uh, <lipsmack> D well, we're supposed to talk about vacations C and, F uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most C and <noise> probably the one I liked most was Hawaii <laughter>. Yes. Yes. We went, F uh, six months after we were married. C And we just went to, F uh, two islands. We went to Oahu and Kauai. The big one. Oh. F Oh, yeah. It was. Yes, I enjoyed Kauai better, too. F Oh, it was rainy <laughter>. Rainy, C but, D you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway C so, <Laughter>. F Oh, really? Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That was <child>. That was nice, uhhuh. D You know, I've been to Nassau, too. I went on a cruise. Uhhuh, C and, F uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island. D Well, I, <breathing> got sick. Yeah, I did the first night. I went with my sister just, F uh, a couple years ago C and, C and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner. It was bad, C but, C and then after that it was, it got better, C but we just, it was a four day C and we were both ready to get off the boat. Yeah. F Oh, have you? Oh. Wow. I'll bet it is. Oh. You haven't been to Spain? Oh. I was born there. Yes <laughter>. F Uh, just ten months. Yeah, C so, No, no, C and I would like to. Huh. Would you? D Now, D now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems. F Oh, yeah, yeah. That would be nice. D Now, have you been to Yellowstone? Yellowstone, Have you? Uhhuh. D Well, F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah, D now I'm just about, F oh, a half hour, F uh, north of Salt Lake. C So, F uh, it's at my husband works in Salt Lake, C so we're real close C and, yeah, we, Yes, we, we like it. Yeah. It is. D Well, we kind of like it <laughter>. D Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips? Uhhuh. F Oh, you like the motels? F Oh, F oh, D well. F Oh, did you? Uhhuh. Oh. Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do you want to start? Right. F Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii? Yeah, we went there for our twentyfifth wedding anniversary. It's lovely, isn't it? Uhhuh. What islands did you go to? Kauai, uhhuh. We went to Kauai, C and then we also hit Maui, C and then, of course, F uh F uh, the big one, uhhuh. With, F uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized. C But the other two were just lovely. Uhhuh, it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful. It wasn't commercialized. Yeah <laughter>, was it? That's right. D Well, it wasn't real rainy. We had s, a few showers, but, F uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones C and, C and, when, F uh, D now we went to Nassau C and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii. Uhhuh. Yeah, he really did. I don't know why. D You know, he didn't like Oahu at all <child>. He thought he thought Honolulu was just horrible <laughter>, D you know. Although we went to that Polynesian Village. Did you go there? That was wonderful C and we both enjoyed it very much. Have you? F Oh, neat. Yeah, F uh, our son and daughterinlaw <child> just, F uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise. C And I know they didn't like it. D Now, we have several friends that, F uh, have been on, and just love them. C But James and I like, I don't know, I think we would get bored on the boat all the time. F Oh, did you? Ooh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Were you? D Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day. D Now we've been real lucky. We've been to Europe twice. Yeah. We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland <dishes>. C And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved <noise> Germany. It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains C and we were there in the fall before the snows, D you know, started C and it was wonderful. It, F uh it was just, it was marvelous. C And we would love to go back there C and we'd love to go back to London. No have not been to Spain. Were you? How old were you when you left? F Oh, ten months, uhhuh. Have you ever got to go back? Would you? My, F uh, <lipsmack> my sister, we went with them to Germany C and, F uh, she would like to go to Spain. I'm not sure whether I would like to or not. C And, F uh, I would like to go to Ireland. Uhhuh. D Well, the there is uhhuh, is, is a little scary, C but I would still like to see it. I'd like to see, F uh, <noise> Italy. I would love to go there. C And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, D you know, go to. F Uh, Yes, yes. We have been there. We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids. C And they loved it. I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, F uh, youngster. C So, F uh, D you know, I've touched on that. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Now that's a pretty city. Very clean. D You know. Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it. Uhhuh <laughter>. We, no, we used to <child>. We used to camp a lot with our kids. C And, F uh, C but now <child> we like things like the Regency Hyatt <laughter>. We like the motels, yes <laughter>. We have, we've gone past the camping stage. We lived in <child> Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years. C And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys C and it was beautiful C and our kids loved it and everything C and then we moved to, F uh, <child> F uh, the Dallas area C and, F uh, it's hot down here C and camping is not near as much fun. C And, F uh, C so, C and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. C And, F uh, although our son loves to fish C and, F uh, C and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.
