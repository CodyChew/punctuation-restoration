<static> D Well, we're just starting a family through adoption C so I don't really have a lot of, F uh, concrete, F uh, opinions. Just what I know out of my peer group, F uh, has gone through. C And none of it has been good <laughter>. Yeah. F Uh, the ones that can afford to have livein nannies, They seem to be having an okay time. F Uh, C but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, F uh, I'd say fifty percent of, D you know, my peers that I'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, D you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade. F Uh, C but I, there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it. In terms of what they're talking about. Oh. Infant. F Uh... Infant. <laughter> Yeah. After eleven years of marriage. D Yeah, we are. We're D actually, it's happening now. C So, we're just going through the process. C So an, C and D actually the question is, F uh, very appropriate. C Cause I'm not sure whether, F uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be. They tell me it's going to be strong <laughter>. Do you have children? C And did you put him in daycare C or is he older now or younger C or? Sure. C So he's out of daycare <laughter>. You, uhhuh. Oh. Flex. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, that's wonderful. Right. That's wonderful. Yeah. C And, C and I guess, F uh, th, because of your, F um, your, F uh, profession. E I mean, I, F uh, I'm in corporate communications. C But I've done freelance writing in the past, C so what we're hoping is that, F uh, E I mean my husband thinks I can do it. I've just never worked out of a domestic base, D you know. I've always been in a corporate, F uh, environment. F Uh, C but I'm hoping that possibly I can do something where I can go flextime or parttime C or if they don't have that, F uh, my boss, I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building. C So, I think that's som, th, something that couples need in going into this. F Uh, I don't know. I do think there's good daycare out there. What part of the country are you in? You're in Maryland. Right. That's what I'm hoping. Uhhuh. F Oh, my goodness. You were fortunate. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. <laughter>. <laughter> C So do you think that, E I mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good ob, good objectivity that, that doesn't really, that's not a correct English C but, D you know in a sense, you see what I'm saying though. From a mother's standpoint, E I mean in a way, i, it was quote and unquote good ob, objectivity. Uhhuh. See. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. C And then he learned he, he also learned that, F uh, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized, D well we're actually, F uh, we're getting ready. E I mean, you're far enough away now I can tell you <laughter> since this is locally, I make sure, we're going to Romania in a few weeks. C And that's, F uh, just. R, Romania. As in, D like, what Twenty Twenty C and, F uh, C but we, we're real excited because we've just developed a contact. Through professional people C and it's private C and it's hospital. It's, we're just very excited <laughter>. F Uh... C And w, i, i, what's the word I'm looking for. When you deal with issues like that, F uh, in terms of family building through adoption, F uh, and then you have people responding to you, D well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare. F Uh, issues are being raised prematurely in my mind. C But I guess they're not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later. F Uh, C and I, what I've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion. I feel that if the child is healthy, F uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love to do something like with what you did. F Uh, I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from, D you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there. F Uh, maybe after two or three or, y, years old. I don't know. F Um. Yeah. D Well, they need a schedule I think. I don't think the United States, what country were you, F uh, in Europe when you were F uh, F uh? F Uh, that's <laughter>. D Well, that's the same thing. E I mean I don't know how they are there C but, F uh, in eastern Europe, my stepfather's from England, it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or geriat, or elder care, as I call it. F Uh, C and we're just not set up for that. F Uh, with the. Go ahead. Uhhuh. D See, I think that's wonderful. To. Right. We cast off. Right, right. Th, I'm that way. Yeah. Right. It's easier C and I agree with that. That's why I y, D you know, what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown C but you can probably empathize with this. It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts <laughter>. In terms of what to do. F Uh, C and I just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system. F Uh, my company, I'm particularly fortunate that they have, they're in tune with that. C But I've been at companies where, F uh, D you know, the, deci, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, D well we made conscious decisions not to have children. D You know. C And in, C and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people. C And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out C and, F uh, I respect, there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they, D you know, they may have the need for child care like that. C But I agree with you, that it's just, I call it dumping <laughter>. I, I... Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Then, yeah, it's ar, in tandem then. I just, F uh, C and there are tradeoffs too I think. One of the things that is a problem is that, F uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers. F Uh, it's just, D you know, it's so low C but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive. C And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year F uh... Really. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. C And they, yeah. I haven't thought about that. Yeah. C And D actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old C and she's at home parttime paralegal. C So I'm thinking, F um <laughter>. C And we get along fantastically C so I'm thinking, D you know. C And that's the way you have to, F uh, how wa, I'm just real curious. How was the Middle East in terms of that with children? Is that, is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. He must be smart. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. The professional. Yeah, I was wondering about that. F Uh, there, I'm in Dallas C and there was just a very big, F uh, series about Moslem women C and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts. I'm digressing here C but, F uh, I was just real curious when you said Middle East, if you didn't mind me asking. F Oh, no that's okay <laughter>. D Well, even if you did, that's okay actually. I think... Right. Right. They fight, they work. F Oh, really? Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. What, what age child are you thinking in terms of? No. For, for yourselves <static>. F Oh, okay. C So you're starting from the b, <laughter> from the baseline. I see <bird_squawk>. Right. I have one son. D Well, he's, he's now eighteen. And in, in, D you know, has completed a couple of years of university. I, right. C And, C and C so that, C but I was working fulltime, F uh when he was born. C But I was very lucky because I was a, a college professor. C And so I was able to, D you know, C and I, it was walking distance from, from my apartment. C So I went up there C and I sort of left him with, with a neighbor. C And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little <noise>. C And I said, D you know, he doesn't need anything except, D you know, look at him if he cries. C But, D you know, don't pick him up and, and this sort of stuff. C Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half. C And I was able to, D you know, get, his schedule just, F uh, cooperated. C And... Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. I'm in Maryland. C But, C but I was out of the country when, F uh, my, my son was little. C But, C but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what I did. Which is D you know, be there short times C and then later on when he was, D you know E I mean this, we're talking about, F uh, I went back to work and, or taught some, some classes D like a week after he was born. C And so... Yeah. C And so that's when I was saying, D you know, don't, don't pick him up and stuff. C But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house. C And she, she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff. C And then, I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing. C And, D you know, in a sense she, she carried him around a lot, too much. F Uh, D you know for, for my taste. It was constantly, D no, I don't want him, to explore anything. He might, F uh, he might hurt himself <laughter>. <laughter>. I think it worked out very, very well. C Because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so, he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers or writing lesson plans. C And he had asked for a paper and, D you know, sort of scribble C and then he realized that there were quiet times C and there were active times. Oh. Did you say Romania or Armenia? F Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, good. F Oh great. F Oh that's silly. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, I <laughter>, in my opinion, it's even than. E I mean your kids need you <bird_squawk>. No, I was in the Middle East. Right, right. I, yeah. No, I was just going to say, I guess, F uh, my sensitivities are, are much more with the, D you know, to be at home. C Because D actually, I had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninetytwo until she died at ninetyseven. C And, E I mean, that was recently after my son, <laughter> was going off. C And E I mean, yes, in a sense, I went to work C and she was at home alone some of the time. C But, C but still, D you know, it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center. D You know, which is much my <laughter> feelings on kids and the elderly. I think we're t, we're too, too much towards it's somebody problem, D you know. I want to work. Shove them in, in some school for twelve hours a day. Yeah. Right, right. C And that's sad. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. No, I, I think that certainly there is a role, F uh, for this type of help. C And, C and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, D you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or, or, F uh, giving it, D you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of. . Yeah, yeah <noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood. Is there seem, there are several, u, u, m, mothers who stay home. C And they take, D you know, it's probably not completely legal <noise>. F Uh, I, maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids. C But, C and they, they take care of another child C and I, I can actually n, could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this. <swallowing> C And E I mean that's another possibility C and, D you know, you might want to stay home one year C and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years C and... Yeah, yeah. No. D Well, actually there was a daycare center, F uh, where my son did go for a year. I think from when he was two to three. C But then he actually started kindergarten at age three. C And so, C and i, D you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten, it was real kindergarten. Yeah. C So he, he was ready to, to go to school at that point. C But, yeah, they're, they do have such facilities. C But for the most part, F uh, th, with the extended family, D you know, you can usually find somebody. Which is much like our neighbor D you know, to, sharing responsibility. C And I'm, C and also there aren't that many women who, who d, who work. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. No, no. C And I didn't mean Israel. C So you, you assumed right <laughter>. D Well, no C because at first thought, when I s, D you know, I said that not many people work, I'm, I'm thinking F oh, D well she's going to, D you know, because certainly in Israel the women do work <laughter>.
