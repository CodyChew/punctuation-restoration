Okay. No. No, F uh, my fianc3e works for the computers, for the government C and that's how he got it. I just graduated from college. <Laughter> No. <Laughter> C Or, what I'm looking for. No, huhuh. No. F Um. F Oh, yeah, I've heard of that. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah it can. Uhhuh. F Oh, I like to think about that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Not always safe <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D well, F um, I can just tell you like, D you know, from my dad and my fianc3e, like my dad, D Well there's twelve kids in my family. C So the, the dental was very important, D you know, to my dad. C But, F um, I think they took the dental away now. He worked for United Telephone System, it's, D you know, it's just another, D you know telephone network. C And they took the dental away, C but now I think they're going to start getting into eye. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock. C But my fianc3e, he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only, for everything he puts in they'll match it, up to a certain amount. Like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar, D you know. C And then he's only allowed, I think, I don't know if it's maybe five percent, or something like that that he's allowed to put in C and they'll match it. C So C and, F um, he works for the, did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards? Okay, D well he works for them. They changed their name now C but that's, that's where he works C and, F um, he, his vacation is really nice. He's going to be there three years at the end of this month C and he'll be getting three weeks vacation. Yeah, yeah. Ok, D you know, of course, it's a go, it's for the government C and he has all, all the holidays off. Right, right <laughter>. Yeah, uhhuh, he has it really nice. It's nice where he works, C and, F um, he seems to be very happy, D you know. Like his hospitalization C and, D you know, he has all that C and with his doctors and stuff, they have, F um, a list of doctors that the employees can go to C and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor. D You know, C and I think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any. C But you have to go, D you know, to certain ones C but still that works out really nice. D You know, it, That's not bad either. Uhhuh. Are you a T I er? No. Is somebody in your family a T I er? F Oh, okay, C so who do you work for? C So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about. <Laughter> You're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits <laughter>. F Oh, okay, okay <sniffing>. D Well in, in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers? Didn't get that far. Yo, you normally just try to sell them on your, F uh, aptitude and not, D you know, D well how much vacation do I get <throat_clearing>. F Oh D well. D Well I'll tell you a little bit about what T I has as benefits. We do have, F uh, like most companies, we have medical insurance. Although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more. F Um, what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to, F um, set hospitals in the area. They call it network hospitals. They're hos, Yeah, they're hospitals that they're, F uh, agreeing with, F uh, T I that they'll be a certain rate, D you know, for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co, D you know, costs down. Now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors. C So it's almost like a, F um, F uh, an H M O D you know, kind of thing that, F uh, only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage. If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get. We have some dental coverage now, F um, C but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile. Like, I've had a couple of crowns recently C and if you didn't have the extra dental plus, F um, you only get like a third of your cost, which can be kind of expensive with a crown. C So, I, I pay, yeah, I pay for the extra dental plus, so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more. F Um, we do have pension, although I've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good C and I know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that <laughter>. After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there. I don't think's it's going to pay too long when I get out. F Um, we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago, F um, it's not an I R A, it's called a four oh one K plan. It's kind of like pension. You put in so much money C and then, T I, F um, meets you half way up to a certain maximum. C So D like I put in a dollar, they put in fifty cents. C So, that grows pretty good C and I think that will be more of something I can see of a pension than the regular pension plan. Of course you can buy stock in the company, C but, D you know, that's not always a real, for sure kind of thing. Cour, Yeah, especially with this one, D you know, it kind of goes up and down. I don't know if it's any different than other companies, C but you hate to have it fluctuate C and D like, D you know, last year it was forty dollars a share C and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share, C and you go, D gee, I'm losing money <laughter>. Doesn't quite feel as good. C And we ge, D you know, vacation normally after you're here for six months C and you start to get D like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you. C And it's, one nice thing about T I is after you've been here, F uh, for five years, you get three weeks. Which, a lot of places make you work like ten years or so, before you get that much. C And we get some, we get, F uh, decent holidays. F Um, a, at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice, to make a nice long weekend. C And at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas. They float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on. C So that's nice, so you always get two days at Christmas. A lot of people just take, D you know, that week, I normally take that week somehow, D you know. You only have to take three days of vacation C and you get the whole week at Christmas time. <Throat_clearing>. Whoa, okay! Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think, F uh, F um, I don't use the services C but D yeah, I think sometime last year, or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage. You get discounts on, F uh, glasses C and I'm not quite sure, there's certain places you can go to that have, F uh, discounts for people that work here. C So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that. <Swallowing> F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah <cough>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Gee, that's pretty decent. Right, C and you get some extra ones. Federal workers always seem to get, D you know, you get Columbus Day, and Veterans Day, and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow. F Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, we're doing an H M O right now, F um, C and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars, so, C but, so, D you know, sometime, sometimes when you go, D you know, the prescription, like my husband always takes which is kind of like, D you know, Contact stuff, only better. F Um, you that's D like a buck a capsule. C So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirtyfour dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings. Then there's other times that, D you know, maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than D like seven or eight dollars C and you pay five anyhow. C So it isn't a,
