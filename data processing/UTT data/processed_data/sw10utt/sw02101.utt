D Well, do you have any, F uh, television programs that you watch regularly? Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. No. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, you will? Relax. D Well, I watch, F um, I like news programs, like you mentioned, C and sometimes I will watch, F um, D like the cable news, network evening news program. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, I, I like that. I, I watch that a couple of times a week, F um, it comes on D like at nine o'clock, at night C and I really don't have any D like situation comedies that I watch regularly. I, I have seen that, F um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on, Monday nights before C and it's kind of cute, C and, C but I don't, <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh. F Oh, C but, Uhhuh. Right. I know who you're talking about. I haven't, I have seen it, I think, maybe once. <Laughter> I like that D Well, I, F um, I, we really don't watch too many programs regularly. My children like some of the morning children's shows, when they're home. They, F um, I just have one son who's in kindergarten C so in the morning they will like to watch D like, F um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's called. It's just like a SESAME STREET, show, C but <throat_clearing>, C and they watch a couple of shows like that, C but I don't watch any daytime T V at all. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, that's nice. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That sounds like a good idea. I notice that, F um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V, C and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed, C and I record some. C And then, F uh, we have just totally cut down, C and we never go to D like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then, and watch and then record over it, something else. C And C so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides D like news programs is the movies C and they have a couple of channels that are D like nostalgic older movies, that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time <laughter>. Like the MARX BROTHERS <static> and things like that. Uhhuh. <Static> Right. C And C so we, we have really enjoyed that C and it's really nice not to be running out. Some of the video rentals can be expensive C and, Uhhuh, right. Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something. C So we, I have, C and it's so convenient at home C and you can do it anytime y, you take the notion. C And C so, I have really enjoyed that C but, C but there are, I do have friends that watch programs D like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it. They have some programs that they won't miss. <Laughter>. Yes. D Well, C and things are repeated, so often that D you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show <laughter>. if I ever decide to tune it in again, the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again. Pretty funny. C But, F uh, T V is something that we try an, to not, F um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say. Uhhuh. C And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your, spare time. C So it's a little bit, something that we try doing C and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day. C And you could say, F oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational C but still you want them to go out and do other things. Even if they're, good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them. Anyway. D Well, Yeah, That was pretty good I, I like that C and, F um, I guess it's time to go. Yes. Nice to have spoken with you, too. Byebye. F Oh, this is kind of tough. I don't too often watch, D you know, shows that are on, on a regular bases. I don't have a lot of time C and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth. E I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value. C But, F uh, F oh, I watch things like, F uh, SIXTY MINUTES, every week. F Uh, ugh, it's kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things. F Uh, like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch, F uh, KNOTS LANDING <laughter>. Yeah, just something like that for, D you know, F uh, end of the evening type of thing, C but, F uh. How about you? Yeah, I don't get that so I don't have, that choice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while, F uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, F uh, military, F uh, fellow. E I mean he's playing a military part. He's the husband of, the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN. Yeah, D you know, it wa, it was on one time when I saw it C and, D you know, it, it's pretty cute. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, no I don't, I guess, F uh, there's some, F uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly. On Saturdays they have, F uh, a variety of things, F uh, C and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time. C But, F uh, they have programs on, F uh, house repairs and, how to build things C and, F um, they have a calligraphy show, C and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that. C And, F um, they have a lot of cooking shows, C And, F oh, D you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those. I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, F uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something, C and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, we do some of that, In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V, than, D you know, other kinds of things. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, those are pretty good I, I like those old ones, much better than some of the new stuff. Yeah. C And, boy, the movie can be unbelievable. Yeah. Uhhuh, I'm not that hung up to most things. E I mean if I miss something big deal <laughter>. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We do too. Too many other things to do and too much going on. Right. Right. I agree. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Okay. D Well, we probably exhausted that, huh? Okay. I enjoyed talking to you. Okay. Goodbye.
