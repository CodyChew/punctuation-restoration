All right, what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. You serve it cold? F Oh, yeah, that sounds good. F Um. Yeah. Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen, C so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue like, F uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over C and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those D like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it. C And tha, it was real good. You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way C and then people think they're eating steak or something <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. It really does. I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it. Uhhuh. Yeah, it seems like most people like spaghetti. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house. Uhhuh. Yeah. Most, we don't entertain D like people from work or stuff e, often. It's usually friends from church and stuff, C and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say D well what can we bring. C And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things C and everybody else brings something. F Oh yeah, yeah. It's a lot more relaxing. I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to m, D you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone. Huhuh. Yeah w, Yeah <laughter>. Do you work? Do you stay home with kids? Yeah. I, I've been working, we're going to have a baby this summer, C and I'm not going to work anymore. Yeah. C So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day. I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up C and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night, C so. Yeah. Eat at six, yeah. F Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, that's neat. Uhhuh. Yeah, that really is. It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other. Right now we eat in front of the T V C but since it's just the two of us, it's <laughter>, Yeah. Uhhuh, <laughter> to see what's happening. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, I've seen those in the magazines. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, . F Oh yeah, yeah, we like that. That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too. F Oh, neat. F Oh, wow, that's great <laughter>. How old is he? Eleven, wow, that's good. Do you cook breakfa, D like you cook a breakfast every morning C or, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, uhhuh, yeah. F Oh, do they get rubbery, C or, I've never tried it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. We had, my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash. Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash, C so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, D you know, C and then we'd go, F oh, this is really good. D Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool C and it's, F uh, it's just really pretty easy. It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring. C And I like that. F Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it C and then I, you're supposed to do chicken, C but I just use those little cans of chicken. C And it makes it so much easier, C and so you dump the rice, you dump the chicken C and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape, now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off, C but I get my kids to do that, C so, <laughter> I, I don't have to do that. C And, F um, C and it really, C and you mix it all up with ye, there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up, C but it's so simple C and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime. Uhhuh. Yeah, it has to sit in the fridge over night, C but, C but it's really good. C And I like that one. Yeah. Exactly. Uhhuh. F Oh, that sounds good. Yeah, yeah <laughter>. C And these days that helps, doesn't it? Yeah. I know what you mean. Now spaghetti's such an easy one. F Um, I do that a lot. I do spaghetti a lot. Yeah, I don't like to do that i, if it's ho, real hot though. C Because, F um, I don't know, I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime. I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's right. C And, F um, we don't entertain that often, C but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it, yeah. F Uh. D Well you see all that on T V C and I could never be that person. It just, F uh, I'm just not, D well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back. C And, F uh, D you know, C so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church C and, F uh, she D like does her own bread and does her own stuff C and so when she, F um, does food, she really goes all out C and I don't know how she can do it and be calm <laughter>. I guess, No, I don't. Uhhuh, yeah. F Oh, how exciting. Yeah. D Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. E I mean, co, cook at five and eat at six, rather. Yeah, C and, F uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family. F Uh, yeah, I don't like the run in and out part. C And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened C and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home. C And, F uh, D you know we could learn to talk about things C and I think that's good. Yeah. I think, Yeah, yeah <laughter>. D Well that happens to us sometimes too. C But, F uh, sometimes if something, F uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on, C but we eat in the kitchen C and their heads are always poking past the door. Yeah. D Anyway food is, is, F uh, a real lifestyle kind of thing C and i, some people don't like to do this C but I like to co, F uh, cook with my kids. C And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help. C And we make real simple things, D you know, those, F oh, I don, I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those JellO, F uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it. Yeah, they're so simple. C And the kids love to do that. F Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them. C And, C and D like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that C and it's just really hard C and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that. C So, that's, F uh, they like to eat it, C but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare. C But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that. Yeah. Yeah. My son's getting to be a, a real good cook C so, F uh, sometimes he fixes me breakfast <laughter>. Yeah, I like it, I like it a lot. He's eleven. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so hi, F Uh, not every morning, F uh, mostly during the summer it's hit and miss C and, we usually have D like, F uh, cold cereal or something like that. F Um, during the su, during wintertime when they're in school, F um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that D like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have D like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal C and the loo, they like it all right. C And, F um, C then sometimes we do something, it has to be fast because they're on their way to school, we do D like Eggo waffles and stuff like that, C but. Yeah, C so, I try to, F uh, C and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that. I used to do them in the microwave, C but they don't like that. F Um. It de, it depends. If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray. You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray C and they will be a little harder, C and I don't like that. C So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book, C but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, D like a plate over the top. C And let it steam. C And then, C and then stir it up. Yeah, C an, C and that turns out okay. C And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a di, i, on to D like a plate, for them to take what they want, <child_talking> they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave. It's really funny, it's very deceiving, D you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, F uh, I don't D like want that, D you know, C and yet if they don't ever see it, th, then it's like, F oh this tastes okay, D you know, C so. D Anyway. Yeah <laughter>.
