Yes. Okay. No, I haven't, is that good? It, it's not my favorite C but, I like it's okay. Uhhuh. That's okay. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, that sounds really good. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well are there just the two of you? Okay, D well, when my husband and I go out we have four children. C So that makes a difference. For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can, the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best. C But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive, C so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price an, and feed the whole family, and like that. Right. Right, C but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere C and we usually head on down, F um, F oh what's the freeway down here? Yeah. C And there are, F um, all along that, that freeway there are restaurant C but one of our favorites is Pappasito's. No, we love to go there. D You know it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much it's too, Yeah <laughter>. C But I love the food I love the food, the food is great. Yeah, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, I like to get that, F uh, a shrimp it's a shrimp dish, C and I don't remember the name of it, C but it's rolled up into, into something, C and F oh, it's really good. Yeah, they are really good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it's very expensive. Yeah <laughter>. <Laughter> Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a, No, sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark, F um, go to the August Moon which is down there it's a Chinese, F uh, restaurant with the lions in the front, yeah, C and, F Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese, C but Chinese isn't my favorite C so, C But he likes it kind of C so he heats us up a good fight D now, me I'm like I said seafood I'm, I like that. D So. F Um. Oh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Is it? F Oh, how nice. Yeah. I don't know that place. Was it? F Um. <Laughter> That's what we need isn't it? No, there's a lot of nice barbecue places here, D now, I like barbecue okay, Texas barbecue. It's good. Yeah, D now, they're real good. They are good. <Laughter> Yeah, free ice cream, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Just to die for exactly. Oh. In heaven <laughter>. D Well, my two littlest, I just had a baby, C and she's six months C and then my four year old he, he still, C but my other older two they can. C So, they're they're kind of, my littlest girl she's still D like wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's <laughter>. F Oh, I'm telling you. D Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're D like we all want different things, C and so there's a H Avenue down here, and along are these fast food restaurants <laughter>. C So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing, C and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own. that's on the nights we can't decide. D Well, five of them, they're good, kids. F Oh, how nice. It will be neat. <Laughter>. Food's, food. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that, that really is more adults D you know, with the atmosphere and everything, they, if you're, like we could probably take our oldest son and, and our oldest daughter. C And they know how to act, I don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction C and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing. Yeah. C So. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Oh. Is it Tia's, not Tia's, F um, Yeah, I know which one it is, C and I can't think of it. F Oh <laughter> dear. It was one of these you have bad experience and, say I don't think I'll come back here. F Oh <laughter> dear. Oh. Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. D Well, I, I've got selv, one of my favorites were C and I can't really think of any other, F um, places. <Laughter> Yeah, you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true. <Laughter> Yeah, there you go. D Well, good luck. Yeah, maybe. Okay. Byebye. Are you still there? Okay, it worked out fine. D Well, we just ate out, F um, had a big lunch D actually because we both have been working late C and we had Italian, F um, have you ever been to the Olive Garden? Yeah. D Well, do you really like Italian food? Then don't, Then this will probably, E I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food, That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great C but it's, F um, <laughter> you're not going to believe this C but I have to tell you this if I don't because you're in Plano, C but my, F um, softball unit here <laughter> is acting like he's dying of tramane poison <laughter>. It wasn't that bad, D actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males, which I'm not Italian, no, it's, it's all the garlic bread and all the, salads you can eat with an entree. C So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't C but I was more in the mood for french toast any way C so, C so <laughter> I really like Italian food though, C but do you have any favorite? F Uh, yes, uhhuh. F Oh, you're kidding. F Oh, sure. Yeah. You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for, D like at Gatti's or something like that. F Uh, six thirtyfive? Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, Pappasito's. We went there on my birthday in March it's great. too much like a bar naturally, and Mexico, yeah, I know, I've seen it. The food is probably, I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means C but it's probably the best tasting, I don't know would you classify that as TexMex? F Um, the shredded beef the type of, spices or sauces they use. Really. Uhhuh. I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious. Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only thing I don't like about it too it's a little bit with th, the meat market atmosphere, D you know. Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, F um, be around not be around that. F Um, I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat. The one thing I notice is it's just, F um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, E I mean we find prohibited, just to cost any more? E I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars. Yeah, I don't know how you feel about that C but I think that some of it's over priced. I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are <laughter>, Yeah, it is I don't know, F um, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, my husband likes that. yeah, off of Arapaho down there? Yeah, August Moon, uhhuh. I don't like it at all usually C so <laughter>. Yeah, I love seafood, C and I, I like a lot of different ethnic foods. I like Japanese food. There's a place on Greenville called Sagar's. D Well, we haven't been in years down near Presby, C and I had a meeting down there today C and I saw that C and I said, gee I remember that they offer you, F um, authentic Japanese feeding, or American or piano bar, C and I remember when we went <laughter>, we were married with another couple that was just dating C and, F um, I had never had saki. <Laughter> It made all raw fish tastes great <laughter>. C but if you're looking for a very, F uh, it's very pretty inside, C and the girls wear kimonos and, D You know, if you're ever looking for that. F Um, C but what other kind of foods, D gee I don't know we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville, which was really over priced. Uhhuh. They had a great desert bar. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, I like, barbecue, have you ever been to th, I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue? That's real good, Yeah. There had, F oh my husband's going upstairs, C and he says free ice cream <laughter>. I didn't know they had that. I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert, today, which I never eat at lunch C and it was wonderful. It was, in fact if I could pick my, F um, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be, <Laughter> D yes, I would be in hog heaven. C And how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want C or do you still order for them? F Oh, congratulations. Uhhuh. Yeah, everybody, every child that I even know that eats vegetables, F um, looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's. It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, I know where that, Right that's all, <Laughter>. D Well, that's all right as long as, I was going to say because with six people how do you, F um, cause with two we have a problem, E I mean I can't even imagine, D you know, trying to, F um, you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children. That's the way the, Yeah, D well, we're getting ready to I shouldn't say this on this conversation, C but it's just on my mind, we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt. Yeah, we're excited, I think it will be worth it C and somebody said to me in terms of, this is food so I can say this, C but they, you have to bring a formula, C and I said what's that <laughter>. <Laughter> They laughed C and I said D well, D you know, I'm. thirty something, C and I think that that would make them drool any way. D You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot of restaurants don't take, in terms of talking about restaurants, E I mean are a lot of restaurants, how are they when you have children let alone three or four children? Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah. Yeah. I just, I just, I've been in some places where they say they take children, C and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude, D you know. C And that always just bothered me C and then, F um, on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves <laughter>. I don't know what other kind of restaurants really Pappasito's we love, F um, we went to one Italian, back on the Italian, we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food. I can't remember the name of it it's on, F uh, No, that's Mexican, F um, right across from on the Dillard's side there, I can't, yeah it's in the strip, yeah, C and it had white tablecloth, I think it was D like paper where you could write on them, or something with crayons it was just terrible. E I mean I was shocked, E I mean the dish was dirty, F um, Yeah, where you felt like, like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something. F Um. Boy, C but other then that I don't know we, we do our share of pizza eating too, but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too, cheap to pay the delivery <laughter>. I don't like strange people coming to my door, F um, No, except that this makes me fat. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, that's true, C but you can always blame it on having children, no <laughter>. D Well, I enjoyed talking to you, C and I guess, D you know, Maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere. Okay. Byebye.
