Okay. D Well, basically I am a mother of a three year old, C so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's, F uh, extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child, F uh, trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that. C And, F uh, I've been pretty selective, C and what I'm finding is with, F um, day cares that are like day care centers like, for instance, F uh, Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that. What I find is that they're highly structured, highly organized. Almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time. F Uh, like nap time or whatever time, F uh, because of parents' hours they are differ, C and when I bring my daughter into such a system like that, F uh, they only have one thing going on C and that's nap time. Everybody is napping, whether they came there an hour before or they came a, right during that time. C And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down, on a cot. C So, F um, home day care has been an option. C And I've looked into that. The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe, F uh, can you trust the people, D you know. F Um, <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Sure. F Oh, sure. Sure. That's really scary. C And, To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care E I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine. It depends on the age of the child. D Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while C but home da, home day care works well if it's an infant. If it's, if it's, if you want to have kind of D like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided. Because I've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids. The kids have, colds C and they're sick all the time C and the, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. C And you never know. I have, F um, an exsisterinlaw that, F um, currently has a child abuse case on a home babysitter. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right.
