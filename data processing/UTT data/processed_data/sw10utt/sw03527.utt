Okay, do, do you have a home, or apartment? Okay, do you have to do a lot of upkeep? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Okay <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, uhhuh. D Well, that's nice <laughter>. I wish I could say that. Ours is pretty small, too, C but it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working to, D you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing. F Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds. Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and, because, D like, we have a dog and, and, D you know, he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there. C But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway. F Uh <lipsmack>, F um, what else. I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that, sort of thing <laughter>. No? F Oh, okay. D Well, if they, if they go up D like, one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof C and I I went up on the roof once and I'll never do it again <laughter>. I decided I was afraid <laughter>. C So this year, he got lazy so I said, fine I'll put some on the bushes. C And that's about it, that's all it gets. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow. F Oh, no. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, no <laughter>. C But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to do it? F Oh, is it real expensive? F Oh, gosh. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah. D Well, do, do they do other things for you all? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. C But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you? Oh <laughter>. Yeah. I don't know either. That's interesting. Uhhuh. D Now do at a do things like plant bushes and trees? F Oh, okay. C So, there is, D like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that? Uhhuh. Yeah, when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had. I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back. C And put new ones out front. C But that was a lot of work. Took me a long time. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and then, then we put in a sprinkler system, C and, We won't go through that again, I will pay someone <barking> to do it <laughter>. F Oh, it took so long. C Because <barking> my husband was, D you know, digging the trenches <barking> because he didn't want to get a trencher, D you know, there is a machine that will do it. C Because, D you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it. C And <barking> I guess that costs you an absolute fortune. By hand. <Laughter>. Yeah, C but it works great now that we've got it. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah, D well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble, D you know, you have to keep the, the area moist around the house or it makes it worse, C so, we had an incentive there to do that. Uhhuh, I have a home. Not really, we have a small backyard and small front yard C but, F uh, F uh, I do basically D like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding C and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy <laughter>. That's another story. <Laughter> C And, F uh, C and, F uh, I do the edging and stuff like that, C but, F uh, it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small. C But, F uh, I try and do as much, D you know flowering as I can, and that kind of stuff. The seasonal things. C But, F uh, <lipsmack> I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in the neighborhood <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. That's true. <Laughter>. I don't <laughter>. No, he does that. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, God. Yeah. Don't blame you <<very faint>>. Yeah. F Huh, okay, we don't have that many bushes to put them on. F Uh, <lipsmack> our, our yard is very, F uh, narrow C and C so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many, C but we have a nice tree in the front C and F uh, we have people that, an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard C and, F uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower. D You know, every time you do that, it, F uh, kind of kills the tree for a while. C And C so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again. C And we started mowing our own lawn C because they were doing that. C And C so, anyways I have a nice full tree now C and, C and we put, we fill it with lights and that kind of thing. D So, C And they would, F uh, they also edged, when they would edge in, into the shrubbery <laughter> and F oh, gosh, it was getting really bad, C so we, Yeah, C because it's an association fee. Yes it's D like seventy a month. Yeah, C and I don't like, I, I just get really upset every time I make that check out. C But, F uh, They take care of the, F uh, landscape, C because we live in a culdesac C and there is a island in the middle C so they care of that C and there is a pool and they take care of the pool C and, C and there is a pond, they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing. C And, F uh, C so you're basically paying, F oh, C and the sprinkler system that, that our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does C and, F uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems C and C and C so that way if someone moves out, the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing, D you know. C So, D Well, it, it, it went up what we pay. C And that's the bad thing. I just hope it doesn't go up any more C because we just can't afford it anymore. I don't know what to do if you can't afford it <laughter>. C So, F uh, C but, they're, that's what they do. They take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it. They, o, only in, D like, in the common areas and in the island. C But they don't do it in your yard. Right, uhhuh, yeah, C so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too. I know. Yeah. Yeah, <barking> that's what we did when we first moved in, too. Just rearranged some things <laughter>. Oh. F Oh, really? Oh. F Oh, yeah. Oh. That's true, C so gosh, you did it manually. Oh. F Oh, gosh. I bet. Yeah, that's a good investment there. Oh. Oh.
