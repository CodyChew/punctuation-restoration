Okay, my name is Karen. Okay, C and this, F uh, they said about magazines. We, I've probably personally take A I think just two C but that's because my motherinlaw takes every one they print and gives them to me, a month later <laughter>, C so. C So I get all of them. F Uh, the one that I really especially enjoy, C and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin, is called COUNTRY. D Well, this, yeah, this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live, like Wisconsin <laughter>. Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things. C And I get that, it has recipes in it, C and that's my very favorite. What do you take? Uhhuh. Yeah, decorating. <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh. Are you? Oh. And decorating and how to do things. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, we, we tried for a while to take a news magazine. We took NEWSWEEK C and I think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested. C But we've kind of discontinued that right now C and we've, we're going to start taking that, F uh, U S NEWS, F uh, newspaper. U S A TODAY, I think it. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. That's right. That's exactly right. I did the same thing. We saved the ones from the election C and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake. <Cough> C And then <Cough> C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, you sound like you, That's the thing, you sound like you have the facilities to do that. Oh. Oh. I bet it is gorgeous. I agree, <Gasp>. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. Every page. I do the same thing, I, I think I opened VOGUE the other day or something C and it was just nothing, uhhuh. C And I thought, Why buy this? D You know, what's the point? That's right. C And my number one pet peeve in a magazine, is when they put the perfume in it because, F uh, real often, I don't like very heavy perfumes C and very often, like, D you know, in my bills, also, magazines and bills, and they'll, come out just stinking <laughter>, the whole thing. Uhhuh. Oh. I understand. D Well, do you, do you tear out of your magazines, your recipes C or do you keep it? <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Type it out, uhhuh. See how the family liked it <child_talking>. F Oh, that's a good idea. D Well, I'm going to pay attention more when I'm in the store to that COUNTRY LIVING, I remember seeing the cover. Back when I decorated the house with a lot of the little country, F uh, primitive things, the little, the little pigs and the jeez, and the ducks, and that, we had, that was the big rage here, couple of years ago. C And I bought a lot of the country magazines C and then it seems like when I put some of that away, I quit buying it, C but I had forgotten the recipes C and I'm going to, I'll have to check that out, <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. C And you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one <laughter>. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh. right. Right. I, I know, Okay, my name is Terry. Okay. <Laughter>. F Oh, yes, F uh, there's COUNTRY LIVING, there's COUNTRY, C and, F uh, F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Sure. F Oh, that's great. D Well, I actually take COUNTRY LIVING, it's a country magazine on HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, because I like, F um that kind of stuff. Decorating and, F uh, getting ideas for a garden. In fact, F uh, right before you called, I was planning my tulips and, F uh, putting them on blue print on where I'm going to put them, C so I'm really into that, C but, F uh, C so, I really get into magazines that are kind of basically into, F um, housing type things, where the, be decorating and gardening and recipes, that kind of stuff. C So I'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I've had TIME before. I think with that what happens is, F uh, it's interesting to read C but you kind of just put the magazine away C and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids, C but, Yeah, exactly it sounds exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter C but, F uh that's pretty similar, C but I find that with these COUNTRY magazines, I keep going back to them, getting ideas, looking back and saying, D Jeez, there was a flower garden in there that I, that I would like to have some ideas, E you know I get a lot of ideas from them. Yes, we do. We're out in the country we're right across from a river, C and F uh, you're right, the leaves are beautiful, C and they are falling now, C so. F Uh, it just peaked, F uh, last week, C and it was just gorgeous out here, C but. Yeah, it's beautiful. The other thing about magazines, the only thing I don't like, is they really get heavily into advertising C and, D you know, it's, it's, it's fine, I'd rather almost have I know that part, probably half their money comes from these people that are saying, F uh, Put my ad in your paper and I'll pay you or whatever, C but, F uh, there's been some magazines I've looked at, C and it's a real turn off to see every other page, some kind of ad, Yeah, VOGUE is, heavily into that. Yeah, exactly, it's almost E I mean, you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way, C but, F uh. Uhhuh. Yeah, exactly. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Exactly, yeah, they're really getting into that C so, C But pretty much like I said, the magazines I've had, BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN, C and now I need a switch, C and I'm going back to GOURMET COOKING, because, F um, I've had the magazine before, back in nineteen, F uh, eightysix, C and I thought, D Well, I'll give it a try again, because you get tired of one magazine, C and you need to try a change. F Uh, yes, I do, and sometimes, most of the time I tear them out. A lot of times, if, F uh, D you know, if I got a chance to sit down at my typewriter, I'll go ahead and type out recipes, C but what I usually do is I'll try it out in the magazine first, and, without tearing it out, and then give it a, Yeah, C and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection, C but, F uh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure, sure. Uhhuh. Yeah, it, it, that's what I, I just went through, F uh we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin. I went through all this, I had this huge stack of HOUSE BEAUTIFUL I had COLONIAL TIMES, I had GOURMET yeah. It was hard, C but I ended up, F uh, reducing them down to D like fifteen magazines out of, F uh hundreds. C And I just said, D Okay, there's one picture in there that, it really doesn't, D you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything. C So I just kind of went through, C and I find that most of the magazines I really like is around Christmas time because,
