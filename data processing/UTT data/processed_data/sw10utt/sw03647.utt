Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today? Great, Nancy. You're in Plano also, F huh? <Laughter>. D Well, good to hear. I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania. Really? All right. D Well, good to hear, good to hear. <Laughter> Which one? F Oh, yeah. The Utah Jazz. Yeah, they're, they're pretty good. They've got some good good, some good, F uh, good players out there. D Well, you ready for New Year's Eve? Good. Should we, F uh, start this so we can, What was your name again? Nancy, that's right, C and I'm Brian. Just a moment <beep>. Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary. What, F uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits? Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. To, to compensate for some of the benefits. Oh. Yes. D Well, that, that's an excellent, C so D actually that is a benefit, F uh, <Laughter>. Yeah. Right. Right, D well I guess that's a good point, F uh, I do belong to a, a large corporation C or my, that where I'm currently employed C and there's, F uh, there's some different things, F uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation C and that got to be somewhat expensive, C so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, F uh, is the group, F uh, group discount. Yes. <Laughter> Yes, C and that's, that's one thing I do have. If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, I don't think I would have insurance, F uh, other, I don't think I would go through that expense. One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours C and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, F uh, nine hour days and have D like Friday only work four hours C or I could do, F uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, D you know, three w, day weekend. And make, F uh, make my job flexible in that case. D Well, D basically, yeah I had to do, that, F uh, the same, F uh, for about every quarter of the year. E I mean F uh, C because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, F uh, I needed to make my schedule, F uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel, C so, C so I, I think that, F uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed C and I don't c, have that in my current operation, C but, F uh, you mentioned, F uh, flexible work schedule C and that's, that's good. C And, F uh, what other benefits do you think are important? <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah, that's true. D Well, C and that's an individual thing. Yeah, with, F uh, with our current, F uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package C and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, F uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, F uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, D you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, F uh, which means that, D you know, we have a, an interest, F uh, in the company that we can, F uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times C and, F uh, also, F uh, in one of my wife's, F uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that, Hi, fine, I'm Nancy. How are you? I'm in Plano also <laughter>. Yes, we're not too long distance today. <Laughter>. F Oh, that was good. Utah, I've had a couple of, C but that was it. Yeah. <Laughter>. Learned about their basketball team <laughter>. F Uh, Jazz. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I heard. Yeah. Yeah. I am. Okay. Nancy. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job. I'm a nurse C and I work, I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that. C So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance C and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace. C And then I have my freedom. I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do. D Well, it is to me. Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement, C and I'm just really not interested <laughter> in all that. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Right, C and especially if you have a family. Then I think it makes a big difference. Yeah. Right. F Oh, yeah. Right. Could you change that as you felt like it C or did you have to do it the same every week? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, D well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so <laughter>, I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude C but that's who I am C so, Uhhuh. Right.
