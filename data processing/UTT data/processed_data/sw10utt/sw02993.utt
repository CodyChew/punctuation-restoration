Are you in the market for a car recently? F Oh, what did you get? Uhhuh, what, what convinced you to get that one? Uhhuh. F Oh, incredible, how many miles on it? C And it's still running real well. F Oh, great, yeah. We have, F uh, right now we have two cars, F uh, I have, my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a, F um, an eightyeight Plymouth Voyager Van, C and then we have, F um, about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, F uh, F uh, Audi C and, F uh, that was a ca, D you know, a sedan, C and, F uh, we got that. The major things, the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova, C and a, well, my son was driving, C and someone came into his lane and hit him, C and fortunately he was able to, his, E I mean he was checked out of the hospital, was out of the hospital by that night, but the car was completely totalled C and Mike, and, they had been, my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that, which was hit by another car. C So E I mean, I got, I was getting really nervous, C so I finally said, we, I want a really solid car. C So we found the Audi second hand. I guess right now my criteria for cars is, F uh, of being solid, able to take an impact <laughter> C and, F uh, C so, F uh, I, we're not going to be in the market for, in the near future for any new car. C But the things that I would want <noise> <<dropping pan>> would be a solid car. Another thing I'd definitely <noise> <<dropping pan>> want would be antilock brakes. F Uh, our, our <noise> van, which is a, a delight to drive, does not have, I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just, are terrible. <noise> If the road is at all wet, and I'm, C and I don't go all that fast, but the, F uh, it, it just doesn't hold. It doesn't hold well at all. C So, I, I definitely want to get anti lock brakes. C So, I don't know, do you have any particular things that, that are priorities on your list. Yeah. I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it. Uhhuh. That's incredible. That is incredible. F Uh, we, we get about, our, the van gets, on highways, can get about twentyeight. The Audi does not have good mileage. That's the one drawback. It's a powerful car. F Um, but it does not, F uh, E I mean, I, if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty, twentyone miles per gallon, I consider that luck, I'm lucky. Maybe, maybe sometimes I've gotten twentytwo. It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving C and that's a, to me is a real drawback. I wish I would, D you know, I could settle for twentyeight, C but, F uh, the, F uh, the frills on that car are nice, but they're not necessary, for me except air conditioning. In this area, F uh, in Washington D C area, it gets hot and humid. Yeah, F uh, C so air conditioning is def, F uh, definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer. F Um, C but I, F uh, I, I don't need, F uh, D you know, power windows are nice, but I don't need them <laughter>. Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down, it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it. Yeah, C but, C or, D you know, if you want to have open windows, to be able to op, if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and. C But D you know, I've lived all these years without them, I probably could have lived a little longer <laughter>. F Uh, one of the things that we have, F uh, we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this, this used car has it, is a sun roof C and those are really nice in good weather. C So, C so I guess if we get a new car, it definitely would have to have an, anti lock brakes, I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, and, F uh, just so it'd be a good solid car. I guess that those are m, my major criteria. Everything else is, D you know, a luxury, C and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong. C So, F uh, if you were to buy a new car now, a brand new car, what would you look for? Yeah, yeah. Isn't that true. It's, it's funny, F um, F uh, that you use, the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable. Yeah, sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up. C But once you get, if you, once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really, C and the parts, I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive. E I mean, it jus, I shudder. I would not get the Audi again, just for that reason. C But I would love, I wish an American, an American, that, D you know, engineering would make something as solid as a German car. D You know, we certainly have the technology, C but, it's amazing, when we bought this Audi, E I mean, everything is more solid in it. F Uh, if, you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic C and I know, C and I, I, C and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car. I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up. C But, do you need air conditioning down there? Yeah. F Oh, we've had eleven days in a row over ninety. They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that. D Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you. Okay, C and enjoy, enjoy your car. Thank you, you too, it's going to be a hot one. Okay, byebye Yeah, I just bought a car. I got a nineteen ninetythree Cavalier station wagon. D Well, a friend of my father's, and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great. It's D like, it has a hundred and fiftythree thousand. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Right. Uhhuh <clanging> <<pans>>. Right. F Um. D Well, it's, I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, D you know, windows and steering and air conditioning, C and, C and F uh. Uhhuh, F oh, yeah. It has a stereo and a cassette player C and, F um, he's told me it gets fortytwo miles to the gallon. Uhhuh. D So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, it's really humid. Right. Crank, yeah. Right. You don't have to stretch. That's true. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Right. F Um, like you said, antilock brakes and air bag, C and, F uh, I'd, I'd really like to have a car that's dependable that, that you drive, D you know, like a <throat_clearing> American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or somebody, D you know that's, Uhhuh. Yeah, they have parts, uhhuh. Right, Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yes, we really do C because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties. C So <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. F Um. It was nice talking to you. Yeah, have a nice summer. Yeah. Byebye.
