Any vacations recently that you would highly recommend? F Oh, really? F Oh, wow. Wow. Uhhuh. F Uh, what, what, has been your favorite trip do you think? Really? Better than Europe? Oh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, F uh, I have been to Canada several times C but, F uh, that is about it for me. I, I am from Denver C and so, F uh, growing up, F uh, <throat_clearing> we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado. F Uh, my family is, F uh, F uh, real into camping and four wheeling, C and so, F uh, several, I, I, think, maybe, F uh, four summers in a row, F uh, we spent, F uh, our vacation time in the summer, F uh, four wheeling through, F uh, <throat_clearing> portions of, F uh, the southern half of Colorado C and, C and, F uh, every time, F uh, my mother had, F uh, F uh, I have two other sisters C and my mother had us, F uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit C and then we had to write, F uh reports, reports about it during, during our vacation. Which, which, was really fun. It was really fun. We, we, each got to write little books. F Uh C and, <throat_clearing> F uh, it had sparked an interest that, F uh, of mine, F uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer. That is what she had originally gone to school to do. Was photography C and, F uh, I, I, am close to receiving my English degree, F uh, as, as, well as my, my, graduate degree, C so, C so, I, F uh, F uh, we have thought very seriously of trying to, F uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, F uh, some portion of travel, F uh, C so we are hoping soon, F uh, not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, F uh, over to Europe and take, F uh, a trip from the northern portion of France F uh, down to the southern tip of Spain, F uh, <throat_clearing> and follow. It is kind of a backward S shape, F uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, F uh, in, in, F uh, back in the medieval times, F uh, to see the relics, F uh, in, F uh, southern Spain and in Italy C and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and Romanesque monasteries and, F uh, just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it. Yeah, it would be F uh, it, it is our big dream. F Oh, su, F uh, really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, sure. <Laughter> Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Right. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah, yeah. You said that you have been to England several times? I wonder, have you ever been to a, F uh, a small town, F uh, D well it is actually about thirty minutes from Salisbury. It is called, F uh, Bemerton? Okay. F Oh, okay. Alright, yeah. F Uh, F uh, the reason I am curious, I, F uh, the other place I would like to visit, F uh, D Well. That is like my favorite hobby <laughter>. C So, yeah, I would travel everywhere C and I have been all over Europe and a lot of the United States and Hawaii C and, So, when I can that is what I do <laughter>. D Well, <inhaling> I am not sure. F Uh, I guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places. Yeah. D Well, no that is exciting. D You know, I have been several times C so after the first time it is like anywhere. D You know, it loses that newness, C but yeah I love it. I love to go over to Europe. I do C and mostly I travel through Germany and Switzerland C and we have good friends in England C so I have been there quite a bit C and I just love it all. I love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different they are from things are from the way we do them. The most interesting part, more than the museums, and things like that. D So how about you? Uhhuh. F Oh no <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. That would be quite a project. Yeah. D Well, it would be a lot fun. D You know, there is good and there is bad C and my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure. C But, D Well, I flew into Milan. My daughter is, F uh, a twirling champion C and she had to perform over there and, in Turin C and so we had to fly into Milan C and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians, even if they speak English, they do not want to let you know C and they gave us all the wrong directions C and there were just two of us. At the airport they put us on the wrong bus <inhaling>. Finally, we saw a policeman. He put us on the subway. We sat there, F uh, we did not know Italian. We looked at each other. We said things like spaghetti <laughter> <<Loud>>. <Laughter> D You know things like that. We finally followed some kids who told us where to get off. We followed these kids with, F uh, gym bags C and we figured that must be the sports arena C and we lucked out C and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground. E I mean it was so, It was kind of a nightmare. C But, <laughter> that was our experience C and I guess all of Italy is not like that. C But where we were, it certainly was C and the hotel that we stayed in, we stayed with our English friends, their team in the hotel C and it was beautiful. It was very modern. C But it was very far away on a bus. C So, <laughter> D you know, it was, it was really, F uh, it was interesting. You always learn something. C And you always have a fun experience C so it is great. D You know. Uhhuh. No, I have not. Huhuh. Our friends live like an hour outside of England, like Ash, around there. C So, uhhuh.
