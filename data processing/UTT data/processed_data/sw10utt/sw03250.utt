Okay. Okay, D well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME, C and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading, C and, F uh, the TIME of course, is, F uh, D you know, more newsworthy C and, F uh, it has more world affair type things, of course. C And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that C and, F uh, do you subscribe to any magazines? Uhhuh you probably have smaller children younger children. My children, our children are grown C and, F uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren <laughter>. D Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to? Yes, D now my husband does that, C and D you know, C and of course, F uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, D you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, C but I don't know, I know a few people leafing through them at the store C but you just don't hear people talk about them, C and I know years ago, when, F uh, my children were young and stuff, I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING, C and I took them all C and, F uh, then, F oh, I don't know what in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format C and I haven't, I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't, F Oh, they are. My sister, F uh, takes, F uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE C and she sends them to me, C and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing <laughter> D you know, C and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living D you know, then I can, I look through them C and I do, I just, what I do is I flip through them and, and pitch them then, D you know, they're not something I, D you know, take any length of time over. I have discovered that, D you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine. Yes C and, F uh. D So, C but. Yes <laughter>. Yes, yes, I will read them in a doctor's office, too. As I said, I, I subscribe to, F uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME, C and, F uh, C and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to cover, D you know, I'll glance through it. I like reading, F uh, D you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something D you know, C and, F uh, C but I do like the PEOPLE magazine. It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young C and, F uh, that's one, and D you know, I really like that, I enjoy that. It's quick reading D you know, it doesn't require <laughter> a lot of thinking, C and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff <laughter> I don't want a lot of thinking <laughter>. It, F uh, D you know, it's, it's much more relaxing. Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world <laughter>, C so. D Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines C and, F uh C so, F uh, I think that probably I will end the call. I've enjoyed, Why don't you go ahead and start. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, D well, I have, in a whi, for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, F uh, I have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing I pick up, C so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, F uh, when I do subscribe I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, F uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine F uh. Yes, yeah, Yeah, yeah, <Laughter> Right, D well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious, C so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason. F Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, F uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, F uh, lately they've just been piling up on me, C so I figured it wasn't, F uh, something I needed at this point in time. I don't know, I, I, D well, my husband would love to have more. D Now he's the type who will get the, F uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines, Yeah, Uhhuh, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well yeah, C and some of those have had what, what I consider or what I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines. They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, Yes. Right <laughter>. Yes. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes I enjoy books a lot more that's true. D Well now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to, other than my children have gotten. D You know, they get tons of magazines it seems they're always getting something in the mail C and, C and, F uh, C so between reading to them and, F uh, reading the newspaper, C and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance, C but I just don't get a chance for those, F uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads, unless you just want to skim through while you're, I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, D you know, waiting on something like that. Yeah, Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter> That's true, that kind of is a good way to do it. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
