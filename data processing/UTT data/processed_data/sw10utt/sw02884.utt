<Laughter> Go ahead. D So Ken, how do you do your family budget? Huhuh. Huhuh. F Oh, yeah. Huhuh. D Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month? Huhuh. Huhuh. Oh. That's a real good idea. Yeah. D See, D now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that. Before we got married I had money in the bank. I owned my own home. I put in so much money, each, D you know, month towards long term savings, D you know, like in, F uh, mutual funds and things, D you know, C and, F uh, after I got married, no, it just didn't work anymore. She spends a lot. She likes to spend on anything and everything <laughter>. With body lotion, everything <laughter>. C So, we really haven't, we don't have a good organized system, yet. Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something <laughter>. I don't think, Yeah. Huhuh. Yeah. Yes. So am I. D Well, F uh, in information systems. I'm a voice researcher. Huhuh. Yeah. So does mine. Huhuh. Yeah. D See, I think we might have to do that <laughter>. Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week. It's going to be hard for her to, F uh, not have her own money. Because, like now, D you know, I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years. C And now she wants to go back to school, C but she saved enough maybe to get her through August. D You know, C and that's it. C And I keep saying, now, Laura, you're going to have to save a little money. I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through. It doesn't work, Ken <laughter>. My mother always said, "now, don't argue about money", C so we don't. C But, D you know, there goes my savings <laughter>. C But, D you know, it's one of those things. Yeah. D Now, D see my wife will do things like make clothes. One of our, one of our big investments that, D you know, I was wholeheartedly in favor of, was to buy a sewing machine. Because she makes clothes. C And, D you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out C and she's already made, D you know, presents and gifts and things for, shorts for me and things for the summer. D You know, C so I guess I can't, D you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, F uh, D yeah, with the savings from that. C So I can't complain too much, D you know, she's, she's good about that. C And, also, we, we dine at home a lot. D You know, she likes to cook. C So that saves us from restaurants or whatever C but, C but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. D You know. Yeah. Huhuh. D You know, C but you need a hobby. Yeah. That's true. I know, C and those nails are so expensive <laughter>. F Oh, gosh. I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore. I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow. C And then she waits for them to get their color back. C And then she'll polish them again. I don't know, whatever. C So she stopped for awhile. Boy, what a difference. They buy nail polish every two weeks, it's, F uh, <laughter>, my gosh, And lotion, F oh, my goodness, body lotion, we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, F uh, she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year. Yeah. It's funny. F Oh, I think so, she's always soft. That's true. Yeah. C But I think, F um, I don't know, maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving. I think, F uh, I think that's, F uh, I sold my house. C And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. F Um, we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job. C So that makes it hard with, F uh, D you know, we're paying double rent, double utilities, C and that makes it sort of expensive C but D see, I live within my, I live within my me, very menial income C and she doesn't <laughter>. She doesn't live within her professional income, D you know. C So I just get a, yeah, C and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twentyfive, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend, C and that really adds up too, D you know, C so it gets tough, I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone. D You know, it will cut our telephone bills, D you know, by five, by fourfifths, D you know, if she's here, C so it's actually tough this year, C but it will be better in June. She will move in with me in June, C so hopefully our budget will in increase then. No. Just since December. Yeah. We're, very newlyweds, C but that's the, we, we're together probably for, F um, F uh, very close for about six months before we got married. C So, D you know, we lived within, though I had my own house and things, D you know, we still, F uh, we're still pretty close. I knew her spending habits C and they're about the same <laughter>, they haven't changed at all, D you know. My mother always said to me, "Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father. Never say a word when you're wife spends money". C And I was like, D well, that's true my dad never said a word, D you know. D So. <Laughter>. Yeah. I don't argue with her, C but I just get all, it must show in my face. Must be like, must be cringes or something, D you know, especially yesterday or this past weekend. We met half way between, at her parents house C and, F um, she had on a new pair of jeans C and she'd gotten all new underwear, C and I was like, Laura. How did you get all this stuff? <<Speaker imitates a woman's voice>>. "Well, I just got paid." C And, C and I was like, oh. It was there. It was burning. It had to be spent. D You know, C and I'm like C and she said everything was on sale. F Oh, F oh, that's good, at least it was on sale <laughter>. That's good honey, I'm glad you bought it on sale <laughter>. What else can you say? Yeah. I think, Yeah. You don't notice it. I think that's probably a really good idea. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D see I was, when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, F uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month, one paycheck went into savings C and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage, and the food bills C and it, C and I was even able to, D you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty C and, D you know. C But my wife likes to spend. She enjoys, C so that's fine <laughter>. C But a for savings, I'll have to look into that. Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah. F Oh, really, because of the heavy ice. It broke the limbs. Huhuh. Right. Yeah. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. I can that, I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much. What happens if something happens to a car, D you know. F Oh, D well, nothing will happen. Oh. D Well, we don't actually have a budget, budget per se. What we do is, F uh, maintain a normal checkbook. D You know, like, everyone in the world does, I guess, C and occasionally it actually balances, <laughter>. C And, F um, we also, we, F um, we have a, a U S Air and Visa card. Every, every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage. It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot. C So what we, what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight. Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth. C So what we'll do is, Right. We actually maintain a, we have, a, we, we, we, we have a checking account that we treat like a savings, scratch that, we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account. C And so what we do is, we anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check. C And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already. C So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything. It keeps us hopping. Huhuh. <Laughter> D Well, D you know, D you know, D you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings, where they just take money out of you're pay. We did that for awhile where, F um, we actually still do it with, with my wife's salary, where we put it, we have a separate, a third account even, a savings account in, in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week. I'm a graduate student. F Oh, really. In what field? F Oh, okay. I'm in, F uh, psycholinguistics, D actually. F Um, C but my wife has a real job. Yeah <laughter>. What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her paycheck each week. C And put it, it goes directly to another account, that we don't, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily, C and it goes there C and it stays there C and it builds up until we need it for something. <Laughter>. Oh. Gee. Right. God. I got lucky. My wife apparently is not a, she likes to spend, C but she's pretty good about things. Wow. That was great. With the money savings there. That's good. Right. D Well, I guess we all have those feelings. I, F uh, I F uh, I, I go to, F uh, I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, D you know. Right. Exactly, C but that to her is sort of like a waste. C But she does her nails. C So, <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Good old Ivory <laughter>. F Um, D well, it's for your benefit though, right. , C so that's helpful. Yeah. D Now do you still own a house? You said you owned one. That's great. Right. F Oh, wow. . that's the killer, two apartments, Wow. Eventually, right. E I mean you're not going to, Right. Have you been married for long? F Oh, wow. C So you guys really are newlyweds. <Laughter> F Oh, wow. <Laughter>. Yeah. I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes. Because I think, D you know, F um, I sort of feel guilty, D you know, given that she makes twice as much as I do. C So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, D you know, sort of. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Had some money in her pocket, yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. That's right. I do recommend the for savings bit. They, F uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt. D You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone. Yeah, C so, F uh, until you really need it C and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else. Right. Yeah. that's, that's been our godsend, D you know. We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, D you know, where, we also own our own house, F um, we had an ice storm up here, recently, where it was pathe, E I mean, it was horrible. E I mean, half the city owned trees. Onethird of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out. Yeah. Exactly. We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately, C but it cost us, D you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. E I mean, just to take off what was broken. Plus, we went with a friend, C and they said D you know, C and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it, still, not all of it. They don't get, D you know, C and that, plus C and then we had a car expense D like that same week. One of the cars died, D you know. All of this adds up C and that for savings really comes in handy. Right.
