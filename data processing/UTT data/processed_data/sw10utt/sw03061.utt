Okay. F Uh, D well, right now we have one dog inside. She goes out C but E I mean she's an indoor dog. And two outside cats. Male and female. The ma, the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old. C And the cats are, they might be as old. I'm not sure <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, is that right? What kind of dog do you have? F Oh, that's what ours is <laughter>. Yes. <Laughter>. White. F Oh, uhhuh. I'll be darned. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, that's to be expected at, their age. Yeah. D Well, everybody always says no more <laughter>. C But I, I think animals are really important in the family. I, F Uh, yeah, we, have five. D Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before. She was fifteen when she died. C And, F uh, this one, we bought by accident, a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co, E or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody, people drop things like that off, up <lipsmack> there, C and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog." I told the kids, "Let's go look at her" <laughter>. Go get her. C So that's how we got her, quite by accident. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. Oh. She picked us <laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, for heaven's sake. No. C But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, F uh, <lipsmack> D well, they can go and talk to them any time, they want to and tell them anything they want to C and, nobody is going to, D you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets C or <laughter>, Yeah. Yes <laughter>. C And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home. Uhhuh. Our one, our one nursing home in has one. Permanent <laughter>. He, he kind of has free run of the place, C and there is some, E or somebody takes care of him. C But he goes out people, C and real nice dog, F uh, C and, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Oh. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah because most campuses don't allow pets, D you know, they just do not allow them. That's, that's kind of great. Yeah. Yes, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, we've ruined them <laughter>. They say ruined them <laughter>. . D Well, we've had a lot of different pets. We had, the kids had rabbits for pets, C and we also raised them for food, at one time. C And we've had it. We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about <laughter>. She was in the house <laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, do, don't ever get one for a pet. <Laughter> They're okay, C but like she, F uh, they don't ever learn their name. F Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you, you had to go chase her down. C And, F uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either. C But, They, be, before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," D you know. C And, F uh, they're not <laughter>. E I mean, they use the litter box. That's about it. F Oh, D my, how, how long? <lipsmack> <sigh> Probably seven or eight years. C And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough," C so, <Laughter> we moved her to the basement, C and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, buil, built her a pen outside <laughter>. C And I thought, I put up with that all those years <laughter>. C And, we've had, we've had cats, stay in the house. We had, we had two Siamese cats. Different times. F Uh, one of them ran off. She ran off once, C or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice, C and the second time he never came back. C And we would see him, F uh, several miles from our house, he kind of moved into a woods down there. C And he got huge down there. He really grew C but he, he never came back. D Well, he wasn't a whole lot. He was in the house most the time, C but, F uh, he did go out sometimes C and, F uh, they ma, it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside. Yeah. The, the cats, my son has a cat, C and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time. C And their cat was not a friendly cat, it was, it was not a good, I don't know, it got, it was just, did get strange <laughter>. C And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out. C And it has improved the personality. Yes. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, gosh. C And how long have you had them? Yes. <Laughter> Kind of lose track <laughter>. D Well, that's interesting because we have a simi, we don't have cats C but we do have a dog, who is an indoor dog, C and she is going to be thirteen this summer C so, Yes, uhhuh. F Um, she's, F um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cock, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle. Is that right? Isn't that interesting <Laughter>? What color is your dog? F Oh, D well, ours is black, C so <laughter>, definitely different <laughter>. Yes, she's a female C and she's, F um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me. F Um, she's like a little shadow, D you know, kind of, follows me around all the time, C and, C and, F um, she's slowing down considerably. She doesn't hear very well C and, she doesn't see very well C but she's, Yeah, at this age, I guess so. C But, F um, she's been a good dog to have, C and I don't know, once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. I agree, yes. F Um, did you get yours as a pet for your chil, do you have children? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh. D Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before C or, My goodness. F Uh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Isn't that, Yes. C So that often happens that way. D Well, we had, F um, intentionally, F um, planned to get a dog. We had just moved into this house and, F um, decided to wait about a year and then went, then we went out then, and found one, she was in the litter, C and, F um, she was so cute because <laughter> all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy. E I mean, they were all over the place, C and she was real docile and, came over and just kind of sat next to us, C and I thought, that's the dog for me <laughter>. Yeah, C so she, C and it, what was funny was that, F um, our daughter must have been, let's see, she must have been about eight at the time, I guess, C and, F um, she just loved this little dog, to pieces C but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her. I think, she was always a little bit leery of her. Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, F um, not very interested in pets, C but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals. C So you just never know how that works out <laughter>. Uhhuh, yes. Yeah. That's right. That, yes, they're very, unjudgmental <laughter>. F Oh, dear <breathing>. Yes, I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television. Uhhuh, C and how, Uhhuh. Is that right? Isn't that amazing? Uhhuh, yes. It's funny how, F um, how pets can kind of, F um, F oh, take on a certain status in certain areas. E I mean, F um, that made me think of, F uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, F um, Saint Louis C and, F um, there were several dogs on the campus C and, C and, the, what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly, C but they didn't appear to belong to anyone. C And, F um, I'm sure someone, D you know, fed them. They were healthy, looking dogs. C But, F um, our guide that day said that the la, one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, F um, dogs just kind of left to roam aro, around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard <laughter>. I know. Yes, I know. Yes, it really was. It was just a nice touch, C and it kind of made it seem more homey too <laughter>. C But, F um, th, I thought that was most unique. C And it just, D you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home. C So, F um, C but, F uh, I, this is the only pet we've had sin, D you know, in all our years of marriage, F um, C and it's been, F uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs C but they were always hunting dogs, C and so they were never allowed in the house, D you know, they were always kind of, Yeah, right. <laughter> That's what he said. Yes. C So having a pet was a little bit different for him. Uhhuh. Yeah, F Oh, yes. F Oh, my golly. <Laughter>. F Oh, gosh. Isn't that interesting? I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet. <Laughter> Oh. Oh. Yeah. I'll be darned. How interesting. Uhhuh. I guess I've heard that, uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Isn't that interesting? That's, that's really something. F Um, how long did you have that? Goodness sake. <Laughter>. F Oh, my gosh. Isn't that funny? Yes, C and this is what it took finally <laughter>. That is, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. My goodness. Uhhuh. I'll be. <Lipsmack> My goodness. That's in, That's interesting. I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat. Uhhuh. Yeah. Is that right? Uhhuh. D Well. Yeah, C so that that was right. Uhhuh.
