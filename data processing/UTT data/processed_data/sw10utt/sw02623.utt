Okay <laughter>. <breathing> I'll let you go ahead <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. That's great. I always thought it'd be great to have twins. D Well, yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Your first ones you mean, it, was this way? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Right. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. That's difficult. Yeah. Uhhuh <laughter>. It happens that way <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, uhhuh. Texas is, much worst for the drugs. E I mean, it was bad enough every place else, C but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's all you can do. D Well, I, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work? Uhhuh. She just recently started working then. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So, that sounds great. <smack> D Well, F uh, <smack> we also have five children. C And, C but ours are all out of the nest <laughter>. C So, F uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l, like you had, D you know, having the time. When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones. C But, F uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, F uh, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, F uh, C and those activities helped a lot in, giving us things to do with the children. C And F uh, we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive. C And, F uh, our youngest is, F uh, expecting her first baby. C So, they're, they're all out and on their own. <noise> They're, C and we have one to get married yet <laughter>. C And they'll all be married. F Uh, C and they're, they're all doing pretty good. They, F uh, T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is. Okay. Two of our children live there. F Uh, one, I, like I said, lives near Maryl, in, in around Maryland, D C. He works right on the border of D C. C And one lives in Connecticut <<tape skips on Speaker A's section>> C and our baby lives just a mile over the hill <laughter>, so, we'll get to see her a little more than, F uh, what we do the other ones. Uhhuh. D Well, they have to. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. To go, to follow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. C And that does make a big difference. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's, that's, D well none of us are. Let's face it, D you know, we're not none of us like they pro, portray it on those shows. E I mean, life's much more difficult than that. C And, F uh, Right. Right. D Now, our daughter, our, D well, she's our second oldest, she has, she's the only that, other one that has children. She has two boys. C And, she works full time C and I have mixed feelings about that. She's able to do that C and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home. C But, yet, on the other hand, I, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children. I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way. C But they seem to, they seem to give, F uh, quality time to those children when they are together. C And, C and C so, it seems, <noise> it seems for them that it works out all right. C So, I don't know. I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family. C So, I, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. It does, it, it, yeah. Yeah. What line of work are you in now since you went to school C and, F Oh, okay. Okay. A lot of the people I've, that's call, I've talked to work for, F uh, for the same. F Uh. Uhhuh. Which your income would be a lot better, now. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. C And it's, kind of a waste of a person. You know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And you, you recognized this and, was able to, D you know, do something about it. Uhhuh. D Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family. C And, the only thing you can remember is to <laughter> <<tape skips>> try and stay together as much as you can, because it's very easy to, F uh, become, go your own direction when you're s, when you're working so hard and going to school, too. D Well, that's wonderful. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It sounds to me like, F uh, you're doing well. My husband's retired, C so, F uh, he's been retired for three years now. Yeah. That's quite a change. F Oh, D well, he made it at fifty <laughter>. <breathing> It was a magic number for him C and, C and, F uh, he went at fifty, C and he still works part time at other thing, D you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently. But, F uh, nevertheless retired. Okay. I, F uh, I have five children all together. F Uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world C and I, F uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen C and, F uh, my youngest is twelve. F Uh, yeah. If you like doing everything twice <breathing>. F Uh, at any rate, F um, my first two children, F uh, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them. F Um, <smack> and, D you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, F uh, a fulltime job that, was more than a fulltime job. I, worked about fiftyone hours a week, because I worked every, <breathing> worked eleven hours every Sunday. C And, F uh, C so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to. Yeah. The, yeah, the f, D well, it was with all of them, C but it was, F uh, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two. C Because, F um, <noise> F oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, F uh, <noise> when the twins were about three years old. C And, F uh, they never, D you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much. D You know, with all the children around the house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much. <noise> F Um, <smack> C so, what I've tried to do, F uh, now that I've, F uh, fi, went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old. C And, F uh, C so, C then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fiftyone hours, a week. C So, I've tried to spend more time with, F uh, the children since then. F Um, what I'm currently doing is, F uh, taking a lot of time. I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings. F Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, F uh, movies. There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights. C And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the, movies. C And, it's working out pretty well. F Um, we're spending more time together. I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before. F Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, F uh, I have one son who's gone C and I don't even know where he's at. F Um, he's taken off for parts unknown, C but, F uh, yeah. A, C and, F uh, my daughter is, F um, <smack> has moved out of the house. Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved <laughter> out of the house <laughter>. C And F uh, C so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time, C and I think it's important that we do, because, F uh, <smack> I notice that, F uh, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, F uh, a me kind of attitude. C And I noticed parents not spending time with their, children and, and going out and doing things. C And, D you know, I knew D like the kids next door were all into cocaine C and, D you know, it just, D you know, I saw the family falling apart down, there. <Smack> Yeah. C And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, D you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now. C And I'm doing my best to keep that up. Yeah. What's your, been your experience? F Um, she didn't up until the last, F oh, six months. F Um. <Smack> She just recently, started working. F Uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house C and, F uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient. C And, F uh, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week. Huh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Certainly do. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. That sounds great. I've, I've noticed, F uh, another thing, F um, <smack> when I was younger my father was always working. C And, Yeah. C And, F uh, D you know, he, F uh, he worked a fulltime job and a parttime job, C and I never saw him. C So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by. D You, know, to learn how to be a, a father and, a parent, and that kind of thing, because, I, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or, catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad. Yeah. C And it, if you don't have, I don't, I, it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough. D You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST. Yeah, C but, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. E I, mean, the, the, the capability to, F uh, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, F uh, the mental capacity to raise them <laughter>. C And, Yes. Yes. It's, it's not easy. I've, F uh, D you know, I've helped out extremely, F uh, D well, I can't say <noise> that, C but I've helped out <laughter>, as best I could at home. C And, F uh, y, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work. Even, if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done. F Uh, D well, now I work for Texas Instruments. C So, C so, I'm in computers. Yeah. C And so, I've, F uh, prior to that I, F uh, I worked in a food store. C And, F uh, D you know, wor, F Uh, right. Yeah. It, F uh, it was, F uh, it was a, a smart move to make. F Um, I was more intelligent than the position I was holding. C And, F uh, it was, <Breathing> Yes. I, I, felt that it certainly was, E I mean, I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for. C And, F uh, D you know, every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them. C And, F uh, I, had, No <breathing>. Yeah. I, F uh, <Smack> Yeah. I, F uh, started back to school. In fact, I was going to school while I was working fiftyone hours a week C and that's why I, D you know if you're working, if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fiftyone hours a week, there's not much time left to spend with, Yeah <breathing>. <Laughter>. Yeah <breathing>. Yeah. D Well, it, it all paid off. C So, F uh, D you know, I got my degree and got the better paying job, C and C and, F uh, D you know, we, I think as a family we're a lot better off. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Yeah, D well, my goal is to try to retire by the time I'm fiftyfive. Great. Uhhuh. D Well, I'm <<fade out>>.
