I will get ideas out for my own house and yard and stuff <child_talking>. Main thing, I like Pierce Anthony. I love Pierce Anthony novels. Figures. What, like those, F uh, magazines you get through the mail? I, <Child_talking> Uhhuh. What about like those TIME books that they put out about, F uh, F uh, F oh, ancient discoveries? D You know, th, how they found out D like that, F uh, ancient man, per, performed, F uh, brain surgery successfully? C And stuff like that. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yes. Oh. Uhhuh. <Noise>. <Noise> F Oh, I like far out facts or whatever. I like to read stuff like that. C But I am a superficial buff. I cannot <laughter> take a day <laughter> I just, Superficial, I like, I like it if it is fun. I do not get too into it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, <Laughter> Because you read it <laughter>. <Laughter>. You are an engineer? <Child_talking>. Are you an engineer for T I? <Child_talking> Okay, F uh, I worked at T I for a little while. F Uh, we have got a book that says, F uh, HOW DO THEY DO THAT? C And it answers everything. Yeah <child_talking>. C And I, D well, not everything C but a lot of silly little questions. Like what makes a firefly light, D you know <laughter> <child_talking>. D Now. Yeah, uhhuh. D Well, that, do not, Yeah. <Noise> <child_talking>. Yeah. We used, my little sister was blind and going to school, C and she would have to come home at night, cut out different, she was not <child_talking> fully blind, just legally blind. C But she would have to cut out different colors, C and that is the best book to go through, those NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. C And they are great. F Oh, D now I do like NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC and stuff. Because I, like I said, I like reading about, I don't know, animals. I love reading about animals. The gorillas and stuff. C And the sloth, it fascinates me. That's something moves that slow <laughter>. C And it is just weird. <Child_talking>. F Oh, D well, Yeah. D Well, we can talk about anything we want. D Well, for me there is no imme, D well, wh, D you know, the financial pages does not hit me directly. Which I am sure it does if I get into it. C But like I said, I do not keep up on all that. Yeah. The, Yeah. With everything going down? Yeah, I know I heard Bush say that, D you know, we are C either bottoming out C or seem to be. C But that is Bush saying that <buzz>. <TV>. Yeah. D Well, I like Ann Landers <laughter>. No. I like getting the paper and <noise> reading the want ads C and just, I do skim over it. C But mainly I am a front page person. I do not go into the details. <Child_talking>. D Well, I know at T I they have most of the stuff on the printout, don't they? E I mean, on the computer where you can read the daily news? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. When I wor, F Huh. When I worked at T I, I read that more than I read the regular newspaper. Because I would read that every day because you would find ten minutes here that you do not have anything to do. I know you do, being an engineer. There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off <laughter>. Not much, not in the area I worked in <child_talking>. We had an engineer in there every ten minutes. D So, <Child_talking>. <Child_talking> Yeah. D Well, it just encouraged me to read it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, D see that is me with the newspaper. Especially financial page. I do not, F uh, I read it so less C and I watch so little T V, I did not even know what the deal was with this, F uh, F oh, I cannot remember his name now. Him and his wife are getting divorced, C and he is tycoon or something. What is his name? Yeah. Trump. I did not even know, I still do not know what the whole deal was with that. Oh <<faintly>>. Yeah. Immediately. <Child_talking> C So that is all it was? He was just having an affair on his wife? F Huh. Oh. That has got to be hard to go from really rich to poor. <TV> Which I am sure he ain't poor. <Laughter>. <Child_talking> Yeah. <Child_talking>. F Huh. <Child_talking> D Well, D see that is like I said. I D like, I do not watch much T V any more either. C But I have got three kids <laughter>. C So it is hard to watch T V. Except for Donald Duck. <Laughter>. D Well, D anyway, I have enjoyed talking to you. Yeah. C And have a good holiday. Byebye. F Uh, D well, I read everything, F uh, I guess, F uh, wh, F Uh, D well, I like all kinds, F uh, in fact I was just reading, F uh, a magazine now. An automobile magazine. F Uh, I like historical, F uh, books, TIME magazine, newspaper, how, how to do it type things, F uh, F uh. Uhhuh. F Oh, the novels, yeah. No, I am not into soap, soaps and all that stuff. I am, F uh, not into novels at all really, oth, other than historical things. F Uh, F uh, I am kind of a, a chore person. I like to do, I am again, I am a fix it person. I, I would read all those kinds of things. Yeah. I will buy car magazines, course I am an engineer C and I read the engineering magazines, and the money magazines. C And, F uh, D well, I am reading historical, F uh, not a novel, but historical book now about the, F uh, Russia before, F uh, the czar, not before the czar, during the czar's time and what it was like and everything. F Oh, you mean the ancient astronauts things? <Noise>. I have read some of that. I, I did not, some of that is, F uh, it is very interesting, without question. I, I do not really know that they have the answers in those books. Th, they, make conclusions in them that may or may not be true. C But they are very interesting. Th, that, they have, what they have discovered. Yeah. You are what kind of buff? F Oh, okay. F Oh, yeah. Right. D Well, I am kind of a hobbyist C so I, I read all those things that, F uh, C and being an engineer, all those books that would bore everybody else, D you know, how to do things. I am one of those crazy people that reads the directions. It always make my wife mad. I, when she ever there is something, I say, D well, have you read the directions? <<Mimicks another voice>> "No, I hate reading the directions." I say, D well, engineers, we, we are the few people in the world that read the directions. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, really? F Oh, yeah. That, F Oh, yeah. Those are, F oh, interesting. F Oh, you like science things? F Uh, I have not gotten them in a long time. What is that, F uh, one that is on T V? That book, F uh, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC is really a fascinating book, F uh, F uh, if you ever get those C or e, C But I have not gotten them in years, F uh, th, they were kind of expensive. I know people just collect them like they are, F uh, They have wonderful pi, photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done. Yeah. It is. It is. They, they, they, F uh, the photographers just got fantastic pictures in those things. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. D You know, I have not, F uh, of course, was it all books and things C or was it any, did it say anything about newspapers? I have forgotten what the question was exactly. C But, F uh, what do you read, I guess, in general? C Or, Yeah. F Uh, I, I glance at all newspapers. I do like, F uh, since the re, since the economy is doing so bad, I never have read the, F uh, F uh, financial pages more often than now, D you know. And trying to analyze and look for some good news in, in there, D you know. F Uh, to see if the, D Well, I have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything. I thought D well, F uh, see if there is anything in there that, F uh, F uh, would be s, positive, D you know. You always look for things with, with this terrible recession that we are in, F uh, to see if there is any go, F Oh, yeah, yeah. It is, F uh, hopefully, F uh, we will recover here, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Right C and he, he, yeah, I know, I do not really know if, F uh, any one person knows, F uh, F uh, what some of the problems are. F Uh, C but there, there are some, there are some interesting things in the paper, D really. Yeah <laughter>. It, Yeah. No, I glance at it. I, I wi, with the, so much, F uh, you sound like you have a family too. C But with a family and everything, there is just so much going on that I, F uh, D actually I am more of a r, not more of a radio buff C but, F uh, it is easier to do when I do some chores, or yard work or anything, put the radio on and listen to that. C And, F Oh, yeah. I do, every time I come in, F uh, I will punch up, C but they call it T News and all that. C And I, I do get, F uh, it gets a little bit of everything. Even the, the last page, is, F uh, is sport, F uh, listings and, and different things. F Uh, and world news, D you know, about, you can read it in one minute, D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, yeah. It is, it is, it is, F uh, interesting, F uh, with the computer to read the computer news and, all that. I, I guess that is a, tha, that is a source of reading. I hadn't thought about that in that respect, F uh, F Oh, yeah, yeah. It, it does have a good, F uh, simple, F uh, D you know, again you can read it in, F uh, in a lot less than ten minutes. It is usually, you can, you can page through it in, I do not read everything on, some of the stuff is pretty boring. I, I skip over some of that. C But, F uh, F uh, it is, Yeah. Yeah, yeah. D Well, F Oh, yeah. F Uh, F uh, Trump. Donald Trump. Yeah. D Well, I guess because he was so rich, D you know. When you are that rich, F uh, you always get into the paper, whatever, if you have a family problem, whatever. D Well, he had a young girlfriend. He was, he is well into his forties, C and I guess he got a young girlfriend who, F uh, C and, C and then every, every time you take, you, you are that rich, you just get, F uh, in that, F uh, in the news immed, immediately, D you know. F Uh, which is tough. D Well, that C and, F uh, his business is going down the tubes so bad, D you know. He was, F uh, F uh, essentially like you said, a tycoon. F Uh, Donald Trump and had it all. He was high roller for about ten years, C and then he is now, F uh, essentially bankrupt, D you know. C And so, F uh, h, Yeah. Yeah. No, right, F uh, who knows, F uh, what he has really got. C But, F uh, he was kind of an arro, arrogant guy, C so I think the newsmen, F uh, enjoyed, F uh, writing about him on his way down, D you know. C And his wife was very, F uh, F uh, seemed to be very smart. And actually running some of his business. It was, F uh, she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his, F uh, did very well. Ivana Trump, F uh. F Oh, yeah, they have been on all the news and everything. In the, in the papers and, F uh, F uh, on Barbara Walters and everything else. F Huh. F Oh, yeah. I can imagine. Right, yeah. <Laughter>. F Uh, F uh, I know what you mean, really. Okay. Yeah, D well, F uh, hang in there. C And good luck with those kids. Right. Byebye.
