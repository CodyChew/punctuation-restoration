Okay. F Uh <laughter>, it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, F uh, D you know, taking the idea of, F uh, F uh, sentencing in, into their hands versus, D you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, F uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, F uh, certain, F uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff. C So it's, it may be an idea to think about, D you know, cost. Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as, F uh, they may say they're not biased, C but deep down they are a, against this person or whatever, C so, F uh, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about. C So, Exactly. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Catches you off guard, doesn't it? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. I didn't think they were either. I thought the sentencing was done by the judge. E I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty. Changes. Uhhuh. F Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Exactly. Uhhuh, yeah. That's kind of how I, D you know, in certain cases I can see them going, F uh, F uh, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict F uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, F uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, F uh, burglary or whatever C and it goes into the court case or whatever C and it's not highly publicized. C But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever. F Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, D well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what. I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, F uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that. C But, F uh, also there's aspect of cost C and I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, F uh, the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what. D You know, being that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know. C But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay. I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work. F Uh, whether it's, I think it's with pay. If I remember, jury duty is with pay. C And it's not, Uhhuh. Paid, right. Uhhuh. Some that may decide not to. Yeah. Right, that it, that it, I, a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not de, and, and, F uh, not depend so much on the, on the emotions of a particular case, but be able to put it in overall perspective. D Well <breathing> I, I certainly haven't thought much about this C but, <Laughter>. Yes, yes, some of them, some of them do C and some of them don't, C but, F uh, this one, F uh, I was trying to remember back. It seems to me that, that, D you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much. C And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state. Yeah. Yeah. C And, F uh, I, I guess, C and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some <breathing> supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, F uh, that, F uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever. I, yeah, C but, I, D yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, F uh, F uh, worried about that. I guess in terms of the, F uh, D you know, ha, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, F uh unbiased. F Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, F uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system. That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, F uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. F Uh, D you know, F uh twothirds or threefourths or whatever. C But, F uh, C and, C and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a, just a bare majority. F Uh, Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, C And, C and I'm, I, I'd, I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work. C But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. F Uh, D you know, by law that it has to be paid. F Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company. C But, C but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, F uh, yeah,
