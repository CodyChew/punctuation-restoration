Do you or your husband work for T I, C or F Oh, are you, F Oh, I see. D Well, that's neat. Uhhuh. C So, I've worked for them for several years, D like twelve now, I guess. <Laughter> Right, I try to, I try to think of myself as young, C but, F uh, D well, have you seen any movies recently? F Oh, did you? No, I haven't, I have, have a hard time with movies that are real long. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it. Was it, F Uh, we, my wife and I went and saw a couple of funny ones. We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF C and that was, that was pretty funny, C and then we saw, what was the spoof on TOP GUN, it's F oh, I can't think of what that was called. We saw that too, tha, I was pretty disappointed in that one. <Printer> Yeah, C but, F uh, C so, D you know, through the summer, we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer. Uhhuh. Right. Have you seen GHOSTS yet? I really, I enjoyed that movie, Really. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, D well, Yeah. Yeah, Uhhuh. F Uh, Van Damme, yeah, I think, Right. Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? Yes, I did. Yeah, I really enjoyed that a lot. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, it's amazing, C but really, E I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing, Yeah. Yeah, I do too, I really did D you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie, I agree with you. F Oh, Hopkins, I'm sorry Hopkins, yeah. I always get those mixed up. D Well, I agr, D well, I haven't been, I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS, C and I thought that was a pretty good movie, C but I thought she, That was, that was pretty interesting movie, C and, F uh, C but, D you know, I, I did, I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, that was really intriguing, C and it, it didn't scare me all that much, D you know, C and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared, that's not why I go D so, Right, C and that one was. F Oh, he didn't see it? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Yeah, I've seen it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I've seen that. It's pretty, it's pretty cute. I guess, D you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. I love that movie, Yeah, C so, Yeah, D well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me, C but I'm a big, F uh, Mel Brooks fan all his movies, I really, really. He does? F Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in? F Oh, yeah, that came out, D like early in the summer or something like that. Yeah, I haven't seen that one either. F Oh, BLAZING SADDLES. Yeah, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better. Yeah, that, that was just, D you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie, I just really enjoyed it, C and, F uh, F um, I'm trying to think, C because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie. I'm trying to remember what it was, C because it, D you know, it's, I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, F uh, Data Switchboard C and, F uh, do you work for T I? Uhhuh. F Oh, you sound very young <Laughter> like just out of college <laughter>. F Uh, I'm trying to think, we saw, F uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES C and, F uh, have you seen that one? That was excellent. D Well, C so oddly enough, I do too, I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband, C but we both just thoroughly, D you know enjoyed it, just really liked it C and, F uh, I'm trying to think, we went to see a, F uh, a real funny one, I can't think now what the name of it was I've gone blank. F Oh, we have not seen that, we want to see that one. F Oh, I haven't seen that one. Were you. My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them, he likes to rent them C and so we watch a lot of them, D you know, at home as they come out, C and, F uh, Yes, yes. Did you? D Now I, I was real disappointed I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan C and, F uh, I was really disappointed in it, it was, one, I don't think it was as funny as what I was an, anticipating, C and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and, F uh, and it wasn't D you know, at all, it was, it was <printer> more of a love story C and, F uh, C so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well. We just got through watching one with, F uh, F uh, is it Claude Van Damme D yeah, and, F uh, enjoyed it, I can't think what the name of it was a, F uh, of course, one of the typical D you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood <laughter> and guts and all that <Laughter> type movie, C and, C and we enjoyed that, C and, F uh, the, F uh, F uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it? Yes. Wasn't that excellent? Yeah, that was one that, that stayed with me D you know, for a month, I just, I kept thinking about it, D you know, No. F Oh, it was excellent, C and, C and, of course, he's such a, F uh, very good actor anyway C and, I think he made the movie, Yeah, Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins? Hopkins, uhhuh. I know I know. It, F uh, D well, I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan, C but I thought she was good in that. D Now, I didn't see that one. No, no I like a good suspenseful story, C and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats, in fact, I want to, F uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see, C because, he didn't he won't go see that, no, I went with, F uh, our daughter C and, F uh, C so, D you know, saw it with her, and, F uh, enjoyed it. My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. Did you see it? F Oh, I've seen it, D you know, we saw it at the movies, C and then we've rented it several times C and, we just love it, in fact we have a ten year old grandson that, he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle <Laughter> D you know, just get hysterical. F Uh, yes, yes, My husband liked that F uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan, Uhhuh, uhhuh. He has a new one out. Yeah, uhhuh. F Uh, I have seen it advertised. I don't know what the name of it is. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes, yes. Yeah, my husband wants to see that one, C and, F uh, did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the, F uh, the sheriff BLAZING SADDLES. F Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think. Did you? <Laughter>.
