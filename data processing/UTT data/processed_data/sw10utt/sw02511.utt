D Well, Wayne, I've never done any, F uh, auto repairs myself at all. E I mean, I may have screwed in a little <laughter>, screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something C but, F uh, I personally haven't done anything. Maybe I've, F uh, changed win, wiper blades or something C but I have noticed since, F uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs, C but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else. I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it, C and he'll do it. C So, he, he hates the time that he takes, C but he has changed, F um, the brakes C and he has done all of the tuneups C and the like that <throat_clearing> C and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car. I was really impressed with that <laughter>. We had to have it to get the car inspected, it wouldn't pass inspection C and, C and C so, he priced around C and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it C so, he thought, D well, I can get one in a junkyard <laughter>, for like fifty dollars, which he did C and then, he did it C and, so, I guess, F uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up, what, F uh, what's your experience been like? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. That makes sense. F Huh, yes. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yes, I'm sure it was. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. D Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time, it takes a lot of time if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, D you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long. C But then when he's finished he's, he always says, D well, now you owe me three hundred dollars <laughter>. C And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something C and he hasn't given it to someone else. C So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate, there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars. There's a lot of people C and he just isn't one of them. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Right. No. Uhhuh. Right, you know, that it's, F uh, really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times, C and, F um, C and D well, I know once when we had a, we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car C but, F um, once the muffler needed to be changed C and, F uh, he had looked at him himself C and, C but we saw a commercial for D like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said, that's really, really good C so, he went in C and, F uh, C but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something. D Anyway, C but the car that the muffler people had, F um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, D you know, they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever, C and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, D you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself. C But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess. C And, F um, C so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father. C And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, D you know, something that they did together, C and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, D you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now, C and it helped him to have a close relationship, C so, that's one, one way he looked at it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Whispering> Yeah, it didn't always work. D Well, I felt, F um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it. I don't feel the need to, F um, D you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things. I'm, I'm happy to let them ru, run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, F um, C so, I haven't tried to do a lot myself. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It's a good experience, it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, F um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, D well, I've, I've been under that hood C and I know what's going on C but, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I, F uh, I have a long experience with cars. I, F uh, when I was younger, F uh, my brother had a Corvette C and I bought a Corvette C and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work C and I've done everything from build the motor from the, F uh, D you know, the bare block on up. C And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, D you know, I hate to pay somebody twentyfive dollars on hour for something I can do myself. It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that. In fact, I, F um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, F uh, my car an my wife's car. C And so, I, F uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself C but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, F um, D you know, A I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore <laughter>. E I mean it's, F um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, D you know, it's, it's real rough in the winter time. C And, F uh, C so, I try to make sure that, F uh, by the time fall runs around, A because we actually have winters here on the east coast, F um, that, F uh, I have, D you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter C and, F uh, C then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, F uh, a tuneup and make sure that they're running well, C and, F uh, D you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go, in Maryland they have, F uh, emission tests. C And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test, D well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test, C so. D You know, I had to do that job, C and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside <laughter>. C But the thing was that I could do the job myself, E I mean, the parts cost me, F oh, roughly a hundred dollars. F Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twentyfive. D Now D like who's got that extra two and a quarter <laughter>, I know I don't. Yeah. Yeah. I, F uh, I don't mind it, F um, there was a time when I had my Corvette, E I mean, of course, I loved it, F um, C but if, D you know, I've got other interests now C and there's a lot, lo, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time. C And I have the same problem, E I mean, you can tell him from me C but it doesn't matter, E I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years <laughter>. C And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job, C so, C but, th, I think the difference is that, F uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing, C and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right, C and, D you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, D you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. D You know, those kind of things, C and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, D you know, other members of your family, D you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up. C And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust. I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car. C And, F uh, he's about sixty miles from here. C And so, it, C and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it. Uhhuh Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. that's probably, F uh, F uh, something that, F uh, is, is D you know, is good for both of them. I know that, F uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars C and I couldn't, D you know, I just like, D you know, you sure you're a boy, E I mean, your not interested in cars, E I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them. C And, F uh, later on and like when he, D you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, F um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. E I mean, absolutely nothing. E I mean, he couldn't even check the oil. E I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested. C And, I guess there are some people out there like that, F um, D you know, I always thought maybe, D you know, if he took more of an interest and, D you know, what I was doing C and maybe we could have communicated better. C But, F uh, yeah, I, I think that's great. F Uh, I trained my, F uh, my wife in the hou, in, in doing things, in fact, F uh, when I, F uh, first transferred down to, F uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eightyseven, F um, F uh, when I left here, F uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car <laughter>, because she was up here for a month or so, after I was C and, F uh, it was an interesting experience for her. E I mean, she'd always assisted me and done some other things C but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, F uh, it was something, t, a little different. Yeah, yeah, I think it's important that everyone know, D you know, basically how, how the darn engine works, it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, D you know, I've, I've been out with my sister before when, D you know, her car died on the highway C and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all,
