Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. D Well I, I'm, I'm from Butler, C and I can't say that there's too much of that there. F Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it. F Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it. Unless they start enforcing the, F uh, <<sounds like That's the only thing <laughter> I can think of. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I, F uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse. F Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University. D Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in. You know, what I mean? A lot of times the girls don't even report it. F Um, I've heard of a few case up here, C but I can't say that I've heard of, F uh, D you know, any significant amount. F Uh, C but then again D like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Uh. D See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything. I know a lot of people <child> that partake in that. C And I'm not saying they're bad people, C but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> No, I don't either. F Uh, No. I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas C and something's going to have to be done sooner C but, I don't, I don't know what they can do. Uhhuh. D Well, It was nice talking to you. You too. Bye. Okay. What can we do about crime? I don't know. The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, <child> they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people C and they keep letting out people that have, D you know, these horrible records. C So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something. That's one thing I guess I could think of <child>. F Uh, it's definitely a big concern, E I mean every day it's, D you know, all ar, we live in a little small town, C and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time. C And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live. C So it's pretty scary. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. It's rough, because <noise>, Yeah. Yeah, D well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous. E I mean you hear about people, D you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries C and they're still, D you know, only serving six months in prison. C So that's definitely something. They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, D you know, from one month to ten years or something <child>. That would be one thing that, D you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, D you know, for certain crimes <child>. Yeah. Yeah. C And one things that they're saying, now, are you going, are you a student C or are you in the work force C or, F Oh, okay. C Because one of the things that I've heard so much about l, F um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much. C And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, F uh, D you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up. C And they don't really, Wow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They say like only one in ten are reported. I believe it. That's awful. C So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it. I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing. C But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, D you know, for people to report it. C So that's probably something else they could do. I don't know, it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, D you know. C And that's like as long as, it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, D you know, C because these kids are <child_talking> saying why should I go to high school C and so I can go out and work at Burger King, D you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs. C So that's certainly a big problem. I don't know what the solution to that is. Having more drug treatment centers available. Jeez, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. C Because it ends up, even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, D you know, huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, D you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs, C and it's definitely got to do with crime. D You know, you hear about people selling their babies, D you know, to get some crack. E I mean, just, F oh, gosh, horrible stuff like that. One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack. They said, F uh, some of the statis, statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are <child> addicted to crack, C and their moms are crack users. C So that's, D you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, D you know, for doing that to her child. C So I don't know who's the victim there. E I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted. C And, it's a very complicated problem. I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh. Yeah. D Well, I guess that's about all I have to say. Is there anything else you would want to, Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's frustrating. Okay. D Well, thanks for talking. Have a good day. Bye, bye.
