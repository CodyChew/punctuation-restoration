Advice for people taking for parents, F uh, help their kids through college. No, I just graduated from college. Yes. I went to Clarion. Uhhuh. F Um, I would want them to make that decision C and I would, D you know, F uh, I pretty much made my decision on my own and my b, older brother, likewise. C And, F uh, D you know, we, we were both pretty much happy with what we did. C So, I think, I would not push them towards any one place. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, exactly. I think one of the first things kids ought to look for is, first of all, they have to decide what they want to major in. And then, D you know, find a school that's good for that. D Well I picked it for a couple of reasons, it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home, so it was far enough away that I was away, but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could. F Uh, Pardon me. Yeah, I lived up at school. Yeah. F Uh, another reason was, F uh, I paid for my entire education. So I had to look for something that I could afford economically. D You know, C and, F uh, Clarion was, F oh, it was roughly around six thousand a year. Yeah, that was for everything. C And D now, I did not go out a lot C and I did not order out a lot, C and I, D you know, I did not spend money on myself. C But, F uh, then again, I was there for school C so, F Uh, C and then another reason was I was not sure, D you know, I always wanted to go to school for nursing, and then at the last minute, I changed my mind. C And I knew that Clarion was known, D you know, for two things, actually, for their, they are known as a teacher's school and also for their business. C So, that's what I ended up going for is for business. Uhhuh. No, no not yet, I am moving shortly, C so I am not looking around here. F Uh, Maryland. Uhhuh. My fiancee is down there <laughter>. Yeah, he works for the government. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly. Uhhuh. Exactly, yeah. It does have a lot of bearing on it, whether you are paying for yourself, or whether your parents are, D you know. F Uh, yeah, because I was paying for it myself, I kind of slacked off, C because I felt it was mine and I could do with it what I wanted. I think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me, D you know, F uh, they pretty much got to the point, D well, D well, D you know, you are at that age C and you are going to have to decide what you want to do. If you goof, up, it's your fault, it's not ours, D you know. C And then, lets me go C and, E I mean, I did not do poorly. I finished with a two five, that's not that wonderful either. C But, F uh, D you know, E I, I mean I worked, I did not, D you know, goof around, I worked. It was just harder, D you know, I do not know, I was used to being, D you know, on top C and when I started there, it was like, you are mediocre, C so. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow, that's really good. Uhhuh. Yeah. D See, D well I screwed myself up also, there was a point in time that I decided that I did not want to in school, C and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said, what are you going to do C and I said, D well I am going to go because I have not whipping butter the rest of my life, D you know. C So, I went and I just took business, D well, being as I was paying for it myself, D you know, I just kept, you do not get into your major until D like your second or third year. C And I am going into my third year C and I decided, D well I do not want to do accounting anymore, right C and I thought, F oh, my God, I am paying for this myself, I am not switching completely because, I will put myself a year behind. C So I switched to finance, C and I liked it better <noise> C and I pulled myself from a two oh to a two five, D you know, in my last year, my senior year. C But I would have really liked to go on, F uh, secondary ed with math education, C but it was just the fact I was paying for it myself, I was not going, to put myself behind another year. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly. I think if, F uh, I would have went with the math, I think I would have done a lot better, because I was more interested. C And that's what I, I knew that's what I wanted. C But, F uh, I think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two, F oh, my gosh, I would like to see the results on a study done. I think they would do a lot better. Because they are more focused. They know exactly what they want to do. C So, F uh, let's see wh, what was the topic, I forgot we are supposed to talk, Yeah, do you have any children? F Oh, did you? Where did you go? Clarion. F Huh, F uh, would you, E I mean, if you had children, would you want them to go to a certain place C or, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I know, I kind of feel the same way I, I just finished college a couple years ago C and I, F uh, D you know, it was while I had my family and everything and it was a lot harder, C but, F uh, D you know, I went to a college that was fairly local C and I feel like my education, D you know, you get out of it what you put into it, I think. C But, D you know, I know, it's, some people are real adamant about, D you know, going to a certain school or whatever. I do not know, I guess it, a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something, I do not know. C But, C But, Uhhuh. Yeah. Is that why you picked the school you did C or, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. C So you lived there at school then? You lived there at school. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. C And that was for tuition C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. For business. C So, F uh, are you working somewhere then C or, F Oh, I see, where are you going to move to? F Oh, are you? Do you have friends there C or, F Oh, I see. C So, does he work for a company down there? F Oh, I see. F Oh, the big company. C So, yeah, I, I have been working for T I for about twelve years, I guess. C So, C But I am not originally, I am originally from Illinois, but, D you know, I have gone to college, I guess a few different places, C but I think, D you know, mo, for the most part, D you know, the teachers have been pretty good and I have got out of it what I have, what I have put into it. C So, C but, D you know, I think, I think that's most of it personally, C but that's why I, D you know, with my kids, I think that, D you know, I am just going to encourage them to go. C And I am going to try to help them financially C but, F uh, I think, D you know, financially, I am, there's only so much I can do for them, C and I will say, here's what you have got, you can either, D you know, go a couple of years locally and, D you know, then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then, we might be able to handle it. But, otherwise, you can just go for four years, D you know, somewhere and I will try to, try to help you. C But, F uh, I do not know, D you know, the financial end of it, like you said. I put my wife through school too. Of course T I paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff, but, F uh, it still was a challenge to do. C And, F uh, C so, I think, D you know, financially that's, that's one of the big aspects. D You know, you, Right. Yeah. D Well, did you, F uh, since you were paid for school yourself, do you think you had a different outlook on it, like your grades and things like that? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh, yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. D Well D see, I think, D you know, I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it C and, C and I guess it depends on the way you are raised too, C but if you, if you grow to expect that, D you know, you kind of go there as sort of a vacation, D you know, I, that's the way a lot of my friends did it C and, D you know, they were not, they did not take it very serious. I know I took it real serious, C 'cause I did not start to college until, D you know, <laughter> I was about eight or ten years and, F uh, D you know, out of what I should have been in school. C But, F uh, D you know, C so I think that helped me be real serious about it. C And I, I ended up graduating with D like a three point six. Yeah, C so I, D you know, C and that was hard cause I had two kids, and, D you know, a family and everything else, C so I had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time. C But, Yeah, you are right, exactly. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Right. D Well m, my wife, was sort of in the same situation, she was, she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go, for, C and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it. C But, D you know, by then she had practically got her degree, C so, C so, D you know, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think you are right, when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say, man I really need this.
