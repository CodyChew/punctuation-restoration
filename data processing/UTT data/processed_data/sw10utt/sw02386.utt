D Well, Patricia, I was just about to get on my tread mill, C and then I remembered that I didn't make a call last night, C and I thought I'd make one tonight. That's what I did with mine, for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up. C And sometimes she just flops them all over the seat. I like it. No, it's just as boring. I read a book while I'm doing it. C But I was doing that on the exercise bike. I feel like I'm getting a little better of a workout, and I'm losing more weight on this than on the other. C And my legs, D you know, how, okay, I'm going to turn forty this summer, I was getting all dimpled up <laughter>. C And those are going away. C So that's real good. We got it at a little bit of an incline. F Uh, this one, yeah, this is five hundred. I know they get cheaper. Uhhuh. D Well, I hope so. Yeah. I didn't buy it really. My husband bought it because we, we'd never get out and go walking or anything, C and we go to the lake C and we ski and swim in the summer C but besides that, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. I think, your voice sounds familiar. Where do you wo, I wonder if we talked before. I'm in Garland. You sound like this girl that I talked to about books, and we got into movies one night. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Let's see, education. Social changes that we've seen in the last ten, twenty, thirty years. Yeah, that one was. The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner. <Laughter> The other woman didn't cook too much either. Right. Yeah, they do. I talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education. C And she was, Uhhuh, Retired, C but. Yeah, C and then one night I talked to these two guys, E no, one night I talked to one guy C and then a couple of weeks later I talked to the guy's roommate, in Virginia, about different things. Uhhuh. One was about painting. When was the last time you painted something? Did you feel like you did a good job? Did you feel, F uh, rewarded while you were doing it. Uhhuh. I don't know. <Laughter>. Huhuh. D Well, how'd you find out about it? How did you find out about it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I have a friend that had a roommate that worked at T I C and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. D Well, if you work for T I you're supposed to get a prize, is what I heard, C and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash. C But then on the letter it says cash or prize. I don't know, gobs. This is going on my fourth week to do it. D Well, like what, tell me. Yeah. For how many calls? Does it say? Uhhuh. <Talking> <<in background saying Stephen did you start the grill?>> <Talking> <<voice in background No, I'm trying not to. He's telling me to start the grill. <Laughter>. C So it's not all stuff that T I makes. <Laughter>. You mean the clocks. Yeah. F Oh, god. Did they mail that to you, or he brought it to you? F Huh. Yeah, C so you're bound to find something you want. Yeah. D Well, D you know, D Well, do you know you have a ten limit, a ten minute time limit. D Well that's okay, C and then they come on and tell you, and they tell you got five seconds to say goodbye. We'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else. Let's see, F oh, I tried exercise classes, C and I never would go. We fin, we joined, ex. They don't either, D Well the first one I joined, they went out of business C and they transferred it to another one that was really far away. C And we were going to do it, there was four of us together. D Well, then forget that, it wasn't near me. C And then the second time I was going to do it at Richland College, C and we, I just get with another friend, C and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place <laughter>. C So my husband's just discouraged me on those things. F Oh yeah, my husband said he's never joined a course, right. C And I got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that I dubbed from a friend. That didn't last long I had a baby, I think <laughter>. <Laughter>. Two. F Oh, Lord, you're lucky. D Well, I've got a stepdaughter, she's in college. C So there's where the money goes. Where's you ki, Two. F Uh. Where you going to school? C And what are you doing? Yes, I do. I just got my certification. Huhuh. The test is a booger. The test, the exit test. It's hard. It is so hard. Uhhuh. D See I didn't have to take any other exit test because I've been teaching for quite a while. C But I've heard they're terrible. Bilingual is just horrendous. I've had friends fail that twice. Good. Uhhuh. Yeah, right after you get out. Boring C and they really don't help you a whole lot. D Now D see, I went to E T C and I took one course through T W U <yelling> <<man and boy yelling in background>> most of the training I've got has been through Dallas just teaching E S L. From Chapter One Tea... D Well, I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom, but it usually's holding clothes <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right <laughter>. D Well, that's not why I got it, right <laughter>. How do you like your tread mill? You don't get, is it less boring than the bicycle or not. <Laughter> You watch T V or something while you do it? Oh. D Well, I do that too. Really. Are you? Yeah. Really. Uhhuh. Are they kind of expensive. Uhhuh. They do? Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have. D Well, you can believe that anyway, right. During the year. Yeah, D well, in bad weather, D you know, D well you'd have to do something inside. Do you work at T I? Really. I live in Arlington. Where do you live? No, F uh, D well, F Oh, really. F Uh, no, this is the first time I've done it. F Uh, my husband was just running out the door, he's working at night tonight. C So I decided to do it <laughter>. I haven't talked before. F Uh, what subjects have you talked about? Oh <laughter>. D Well, that's interesting. It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle. Right? <laughter>. F Oh, my goodness <laughter>. really have a lot of variety. F Oh, A school administrator. D Well that could, That would have been interesting. Really, D well that's neat. F Hm. How long is this going to go on, do you know? I don't either <laughter>. It's interesting, though. I never heard of such a project before. Pardon me? F Oh, I don't know. I guess my husband got a letter at the office, I, I presume, C and they must have been asking. Does your husband work with T I. F Oh really. Uhhuh. . F Oh, C so they wanted any, anybody, don't have to work at T I. D Well, that's interesting. I had no idea that was just for the employees, C and I couldn't understand, I kept getting these calls, I thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called T I, D you know, there is Texas Industries and different things. I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was <laughter>. I didn't know. F Ooh. Oh. D Well the prizes are pretty nice. He brought a booklet home C and depending on how many calls, I think three was the minimum. C But it went up to, I don't know, nine or ten. How many calls have you ma, had? D Well, it sounds like a lot. F Oh, my. C And some of the prizes are pretty nice. F Oh, I wish I had that booklet here. F Oh, I think I do, it's right here. I'll look at the end because those would be the best ones, okay? F Um, D well, they have some watches that look really nice. There's one that's got some diamonds on it. . I haven't quite figured that out. I thought it was eight or nine, C but seems like too nice a prize for nine, just nine calls, isn't it? Says when we have enough calls from you, you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem, for gifts. Are you listening to him? Oh <laughter>. It says three for a B gift, five for a C gift, et cetera. C And this only goes up to F. C So I thought that was somewhere around nine. C But anyway, it's got these beautiful watches on it. Let me see what else it has a, F uh, clock radio that also plays c, F uh, D you know, tapes. Then it's got, F oh some binoculars, and some pretty brass lamps. Got some, F oh, a food processor. F Oh no, I don't, I haven't seen anything in here that T I makes. The Mister Coffee, the double Mister Coffee, D you know, the two. F Oh, and there's a phone in here that's hilarious. It has a button you can push, if you get a call you don't like then it makes machine gun noise <laughter>. C And then there's an attache case, and cordless telephone, C and then there's a card table, doesn't have any chairs, just a card table. F Oh, some more jewelry, suitcases, C and have you seen those univ, anniversary lamps where the little balls go around. Yeah, clocks. I can, I'm going crazy, my daughter's playing the piano C and I can't think. It's got one of those, C and F um, D well, it's got a lot, E I mean, pages and pages. It's got wheelbarrows. <laughter> A lot of kitchen stuff, of the mixer, the toaster, a waffle maker, popcorn popper, all kinds of stuff like that. Here's where, here's a calculator but it's not even made by T I, isn't that funny. He brought it home. I believe it came in his, F uh, his mail. Here's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools, someone, a lot of tools, a man might like D you know. F Oh yeah, you're bound to. All kinds of phones and clocks C and, F uh, here's more jewelry C and F oh, there's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table. F Oh, here's some brass animals, brass candlesticks, they're pretty. C So I'm sure you'd find something. C And, F uh. Silver plated bowls and stuff. There's a lot of stuff, it's a big booklet. F Oh, no. <Laughter> F Oh, D well, it's been fun, this is my first time to do it. Yeah. I went to Metropolitan a couple of years ago, C so I sit and study, I sit in class, C and I have really ballooned up since then, C and, C so, he's says I ought to join one of those that makes you go, C but, . That's a very common experience. . No. That's funny <laughter>. Right, D well, if you, if you can make yourself do the tread mill, E I mean, gosh, that's a good workout. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah, right, each one of those puts on a few pounds, doesn't it. How many children do you have? Yeah, I do, too. Two, a girl, one's in college, C so I don't have a, have a baby anymore <laughter>. F Oh, D well. tell me about it, tell me, <laughter>, putting two of us through, isn't he lucky. D Well, me, I'm going, and my daughter Janet in Austin. Yeah, right. C So, I'll probably have to sell the prize I get <laughter>. U T A right here. D Well, I'm, F um, going to be certified as an English teacher teach English as a second language. You're kidding. F Oh, that's, . Hard. F Oh, no. Really. Really, how are the other ones. I haven't taken any of the exit tests. F Oh, yeah, before they started, Really. Really. I didn't know any of this. None of my friends have failed the English or the education ones <child>. I really ought to take those quickly while I still remember some. I know. <child_yelling>. Oh.
