Okay, F uh, some of the T V shows I like to watch are, F uh, mostly evening, evening shows C and, F uh, D like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY. I usually watch those prime time programs. F Uh, I like to watch FORTYEIGHT HOURS. Never miss that and, F uh, sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE. F Uh, C and then the week goes by C and I don't think I <laughter> ever watch anything else. D You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. But, F uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, D you know, what's going on and that kind of thing. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to follow. F Oh, I've never seen that one. Okay, yeah. I've seen a, F uh, the previews for that. Uhhuh. F Oh, we never miss that, C or we try not to miss that. F Oh, we think it is, so funny. F Oh, just part of it <laughter>. Uhhuh. No. Uhhuh, F oh, that's right C and the neighbor, they thought it was the neighbor. <Laughter>. Yeah. C And then, F uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, I've never seen that program. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Yeah, right. F Oh, I do, too <laughter>. F Oh, I do, too, C but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs. I don't know why. I just, if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. I watch one C and, Oh. F Oh, okay. Yeah, that's been on for years. F Oh, C and so you get to come home and watch them <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah D well, we, Yeah, that's a good idea. We did have H B O, C but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, D you know. It's just, Oh. F Oh, yes, if you're up then <laughter>. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, yeah. Right. <Laughter>. I li, I have a few, D you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss. L A LAW is one of them. Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything. Right, C and, F uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL. THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless. She, It's very good. It, it's probably very much a woman's mo, F uh, show. C But, F uh, C and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, F uh, A what is it, F uh, HANDYMAN. That's not what, F uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT. It's hysterical, isn't it? <Laughter>. <Laughter> Did you catch the Christmas? <Laughter>. I thought it was, D you know, C and it had such a good story, too. Did you see the end of it? D Well, D you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus. They thought it was the neighbor. He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip. <Laughter>. I thought that was wonderful. C And, F uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it. On our, F uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show. C And it showed the latest, F uh, developments from all the computer companies. D Well, D you know, it's, unless you're really into computers, you w, and software, you probably wouldn't be interested, C but I don't know, it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there. C And, F uh, D you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, D you know, and then they also, the hardware. C So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for C and, I enjoyed that. It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials. It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show C so, C And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET. <Laughter>. D Well, there's very few that, D you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch. C But, F uh, now I do, before I go to work, I tape my soap opera. D Well, I watch two, C but one's a halfhour C and one's an hour C and, C and they lead into each other. C And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS. C And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl <laughter>. C So it's just, D you know, it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twentyfive years. Yes, C and I don't have anyone else at home, C so I have freedom to watch whatever I want. C But I like, I like every, I like the, F uh, the information shows C and I like the comedies C and D you know, C and I, I do like good movies. I prescribed, subscribe to H B O. C So I can get some of the movies. It is. C But I don't sleep a whole lot C and I, D you know, at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V C and, C And, F uh, <Laughter> C So that's, C and you don't get good reception without cable C and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels, C so that's primarily why I have it right now. I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, D you know, C but that was years,
