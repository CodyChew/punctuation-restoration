D So, what is your latest experience with painting? Uhhuh. Right. <Laughter>. Isn't that amazing? It, it looks so easy just slapping paint on. I had an addition put on C and, F um, we, C and I decided, because my inner room looked so dingy, because I put these beautiful French doors in C and, so I decided, okay, I'll just, D you know, have them paint this little room, D you know, a little ten by ten dining area. It took four days. <Laughter> C And even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate. He said, D Well, I'll be done this afternoon, D you know C and pretty soon, before you know it, D you know, he's run into so many problems, C and it's just, there's nothing there to be a problem I thought, C but, F um, it just took him so much longer, C and C and he was there to paint the French doors also. F Um, C and if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do <laughter>, because it looked so formidable, F Um, then, then just <laughter>, we, we got this painter, C and I just called him because I got a little ad out of the, D you know, the adcose or whatever in the mail, and, F uh, D you know, just got this painter person over here. C And he said, Yeah, I can finish it in a day. F Oh, right. <laughter> C so the whole project basically took a week <laughter>. <Laughter>. Funny. C And I go what makes you a professional? <laughter> D You know? <Laughter> How much, D you know, more do you know than I know about this whole situation, C but he just kept painting on those French doors, D you know, C and each little, <breathing> F um paint stroke, D you know, the paint wasn't going on right is what it was. C So he had to redo them like three times <breathing> before I was happy with them, before he was happy, D you know, that they even looked halfway decent, C and so it's just been painting, yeah, E I mean, hire a professional, C but that doesn't guarantee anything <laughter>. Right. <Laughter>. F Oh, no. F Oh, C and that can make a difference, too. E I mean, C and they bring the, F uh, D you know, little samples C and you've got like maybe, five hundred, D well that's an exaggeration, C but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints, C and you don't know what you to want to, put up there, C and by the time it's on, I, I selected a, what I thought was white, C and it was like you said, D you know, it was blue blue cast to it. C And it looked awful on <laughter>. C So that was the next problem. He had to redo that too. I <laughter>, This was a, C and it was a major project getting the money together <laughter> to do it too, by the end, of the whole project, C but, D you know, we worked something out, because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long. He really came over here to paint, I think, because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house <laughter>, I don't think he did the interiors very well <laughter>. <Laughter> C And, yeah. No <laughter>. Uhhuh. It wasn't a big deal for them. I don't know. I think my husband's really glad about that <laughter>. For sure. You just, you just get in there and do it yourself. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, it's, it's not that easy. It's like, it's, F uh, I don't even know if I, D you know, I would not even recommend this person again to anybody. I don't know. A, I guess you ge, I, I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, D Well, I'll accept something, or you just really have to get on their back, E I mean, about things and, and working with what they say are professional painters. E I mean, I tell you what, the fumes that the, the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any, <laughter>. E I mean the fumes are amazing, C and I, I don't think I could stay sane, D you know <laughter>, and working with all that. C So, E I mean, I know it's not lead based any more, paints, C but, my goodness <laughter>. I, D well, yeah, I, <laughter> think so <laughter>. F Oh, it does. Oh. Yeah. Right <breathing>. D Well, maybe there are some professionals out there <laughter>. It makes you wonder <laughter>. D Really, it does, F uh, for all that. D Well, F um, I hope you have a nice day today. C And you take care. Okay. Okay. Bye, Kay. <Breathing> D Well, <breathing> I don't, I haven't done any painting since I was a child C and my father would be painting and I'd ask him if I could, <breathing> D you know, <children_talking> take a turn or something, C but, F uh, when we bought our home <children_talking> it was recently <children_talking> <swallowing> updated. They did that, maybe improvements, so they could sell it and things, C so we didn't have to do any painting. C And the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted, C but I, the experience that I've had is that, F um, <breathing> whatever time he gave, said, F Oh, it would take me about, just about four hours, because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there, <breathing> C and he said, F Oh, it's going to be just about four hours. D Well, <laughter> he was gone the whole day, C and he said, D Well, all I got done was the taping around <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Noise>. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Children_talking>. F Oh, I know, it's just awful. <Laughter>. Pane. Uhhuh. <Noise> F Um. <Breathing> No, C and it really, like you said, always takes <children_talking> way longer than anyone, <lipsmack> F um, <swallowing> is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he, <breathing> it was just the preparation time was so long. <Breathing> That when he actually got down to the painting part, <breathing> <laughter>, he, it was like <laughter> ten times longer than he already thought he would be done, C and, <breathing> C and, F uh, he did part of the, in the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in, C and, F um, <children_talking> <lipsmack> C and he didn't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans, he had finished one can off and started another one. <Breathing> C And then we went in there, D you know, one was, bu, they were white, C but one had more blue to it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Children_talking>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Breathing> Yeah. Right. <Laughter>. F Oh, boy. D Well, I don't recall my parents having that much trouble <laughter>. E I mean, D you know, they painted our rooms all the time, <children_talking> C and we had a, a wooden, we hardly, we just had brick on D like as accent on a certain area of our home <breathing> growing up, C and so he had to paint the outside all the time. <lipsmack> C and, F um, I just don't think, D you know, that there was that big problem <laughter>. <Breathing> No, C but to us, D you know, we're going, F oh, we're so glad we have a brick home, all we have is like trim around the windows or something, C and <Lipsmack> No, F uh no painting to have to do. I, <noise> <<traffic outside>> I don't know that w, <swallowing> D like, F uh, <noise> D say, we're freshly graduated from school and things, C so we haven't gotten to the point where we're <breathing> hiring <breathing> professionals to do too much <children_talking> of our needs. We've been trying, D you know, we've done that the whole time we were in school. Like, trying to repair our own cars, C and, so I, I want to get to the point where I could feel like I could just hire someone <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Children_talking>. That's true. <Children_talking>. No. C But, still, it's harmful, C and they have to live with that every day in, in their clothes and everything. The only painting job that was really <children_talking> <smack> painless for us was in this condominium that the, F um, association that manages it, <children_talking> they have to take care of like the structural <breathing> damage. <Children _talking> there was a roof leak, C and that was not something that we had to pay for. C So they sent their painters in to, to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then, D you know, repaint the whole ceiling, <lipsmack> in a certain room. <Breathing> C But they came in, and, F um, <children_talking> they came in and did it and left in just no time at all, C and I think it's because they, D you know, they were accustomed to working in that <swallowing> environment, in those particular condominiums, <breathing> C and I don't, I didn't watch them, C but I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, D you know, just within a couple of hours. C And, F uh <breathing>, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Breathing>. F Um. <Breathing> D Well, you too, I guess it's ge, getting to be lunch time, I need to go take care of the kids C but, You have a good day. Bye.
