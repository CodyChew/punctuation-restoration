D Well, I really enjoy reading the newspaper, we get the daily, F uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS C and I try to look at it. If I get busy <laughter> I don't get a chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies have been un, haven't been touched C but <talking>, D Well, not in the morning, C but, F uh, if the, D well, I have two children C and if they, F uh, go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll, D you know, maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, we, I don't take, D like TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that, C but I do like to watch, F uh, C N N. I have several chores and things to do, C so it comes on at, D like the nine o'clock p m C and so I will turn that on while I'm doing some work C and I can hear the news, not have to sit right down and listen to it. D Well, <laughter> he didn't have too good of opinion of it, no, <breathing> E I mean yes I did hear that C and so, F uh, I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. D Well, I wouldn't think th, I would really say that that's not true, because F uh, it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates, C and, so, F uh, news stations always tell the story from a certain angle C and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions. You may never get the truth, C but you'll have a variety to choose from. Uhhuh. Yeah, I do, too. Do you ever listen to the radio C or any, Uhhuh. No, I don't. F Um. I really, F uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music C and, F uh, Yeah, my husband does C and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, F oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, D you know, if it's something really interesting C and C and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it, C but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Do you have a particular local channel that you watch? Uhhuh. F Um. D Well I am, we're fairly new to the area C and so we're still shopping <laughter>, for a favorite channel. Uhhuh. D Well, I really think so. I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the, F uh, anchors, are seem to be like white Anglo Saxon protestant type people C and they all seem to be, D you know, fairly similar C and I kind of prefer a, D you know, some females, I don't recall that they have any female anchors C and I like different, I like the anchors to be different kinds of people. Uhhuh. Yes I have C and, F uh, I prefer D you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? D Well, we, D you know, D like all of the stations seem to be pretty good, it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into. Houston. C So we had a, a favorite, C or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news. I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors, C and you feel comfortable with them C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's true. Their job. That's true. C So that really effects how they report the news. <Laughter> Is he the sports, Yeah, I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed. Yeah. Byebye. D Well, do you have time to read the paper in the morning? D You know, a lot, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all. We, we took the MORNING NEWS for a while, C and then, F uh, D well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages C and then, F uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, <laughter> A that's off the subject, went outside, picked it up and ran off. D Anyway, F uh, C and then we switched the MORNING NEWS C but we found we couldn't read enough of it C and by the time I got home and had time to, to read some, C but, C but I guess the, the issue is, F uh, beside the newspaper, do you take any news magazines? Did, did you, did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about, F uh, Pete Arnett, and, F uh, the, the news coverage? D Well any, D you know, TIME magazine and even the news that, sometimes that, that's why I like some diversity the idea that, I, we have TIME which, which we take from time to time C and we, the problem is they call up and make this deal, D you know, C and, D well we're taking that C and, C and we also hit the Garland, GARLAND DAILY NEWS, I guess it's, it comes out sporadically, like, twice a week or some, C but I think what's interesting is that if you're, that there, F uh, that as difficult as it is, or as, as much as they try, they put some bias, I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group C and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial. C And that, C but, C and, C and, D you know, people accuse them of controlling the news he says, D you know, we don't control the news we just report it the way we, the way it is. C And, Yes. <Laughter> Yeah, C and I, I thought that was particularly interesting in the, the Gulf War, that there were pieces of information that, that were apparently, F uh, leaked just as a, as, as, F uh, a ploy. Which was, F uh, I, I find that fascinating that, F uh, I listen to K R L D, and, F uh, F uh, K L I F, the news talk radio. C And I actually listen to C N N radio. Do you know it was on radio now? It's on eleven ninety. D Well, when I go to work I listen. <Sneezing>. Yeah. D Well, with, with your, D you know, if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is C and then they start repeating everything. C And, C and so it's kind of a, F oh, that's what's interesting is the C N N, F uh, A I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local. I listen to a little of that C and I listen to a little of ninety point one. I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher. That and ninetyeight point seven, I'm eclectic approach. D Well, I watch channel five C but that has to be, that's another bias. That has to do with the weather reporting. I'm not sure that, D actually I think channel eight is probably, C but I know Dave Fox, he goes to our church C so, D Well the, Channel eight when they came here thirteen, fourteen years ago, Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together, F uh, from Oklahoma City C and apparently channel eight was way down C and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job C and then they've been some people move around C and, F uh, John Chriswell is, D anyway, the, I, I don't know, do you, do you, do you seem to, can you tell much difference between the local radio, T V stations? I think that adds to the diversity, I think that, F uh, I like that. F Uh, there, I know, D you know, John Wylie Price, I don't know if you kept up, C but he's been protesting, Yeah, C and I think he has legitimate argument. E I mean you can, F uh, I, I, I grew up in Alabama C and so I, I have some prejudices. C But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station. F Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs C but I think that, F uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing C and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good, I occasionally go to Saint Louis. And, F uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news. I think channel eight is the number one, F uh, A B C affiliate in the U S. I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he, Course he pumping his own <<faint>>, Where'd you move from? Yeah. It is interesting though, it becomes a little of personality. In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, F oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twentyone, twentythree years ago or so, twentyfour, D anyway long time ago C and, C and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago C and, F uh, they had, they had fired him, F uh, because he was too t, D anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds C and that's interesting. That's, that's what the T V stations do. they're trying to get ratings. C And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings. D Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy C but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes. Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes? Okay, D well good talking to you. Goodnight.
