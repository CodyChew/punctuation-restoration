C And I have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that I hadn't voted in an election yet, C and although I did go down and register and I, that's the first time I've ever done that. Has, what's been your voting experience? <Laughter> D Well, do you feel like, F uh, E I mean, I, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. That's really true. That's kind of the way I have felt. I, I also feel guilty, F uh, not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates. Course, we only have mostly the representation given in the media, C but, F uh, I have felt since I've been here that I haven't known what the issues were and that I, because it was a new community. Uhhuh. It does. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No. Uhhuh. No. Right. Uhhuh. Yes, C and, F uh, C and, F uh, I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, F uh, since we're s, back on the old system of electoral votes and, or that, and that you don't necessarily, your vote doesn't necessarily elect president. Right C and it's kind of, it's awful, C and, C and it's hard to feel like one person, C but I know that it's important, C and I feel guilty that I haven't done that here, haven't taken the time C and I know that, D you know, people can make a difference, C but it's hard to, to face the corruption, like you say, and, F uh, and to know what you're up against. C And it makes me feel bad that, I'm glad, E I mean, I am thankful for the, F uh, <laughter> nineteenth amendment is it that gives women the right to vote <laughter> C and, F uh, I'm glad that that happened and everything C and I hope that I will become a better, make a better difference in, C but I haven't done that so far. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, C and it's not very likely. E I mean, it seems like th, My voting experience? I, I, D well, personally I've been very diligent until recent years. When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain. For the issues that, D you know, <child_yelling> that I felt really strong for, F uh, I think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of <child_yelling> the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run. You really do have to study to get yourself, F uh, up to par with what is truly going on C and that takes a lot of research C and C and people today are very busy C and F uh, C and that is an excuse because we are, we are always, F uh, invo, I know I'm heavily involved in other things C and, C and to take time out and, F uh, study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time C and I don't have the time to devote to that C and, F uh, you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard. C And unfortunately they are not. C And, F uh, it's really a dilemma, F uh, that we find ourselves in, I believe. F Uh, <Child_yelling> C So I kind of just have taken a back step away and, F uh, hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there. Take it, C because it is a task that is, to me, kind of overwhelming. Right, they just want to see how close the electoral votes <laughter> are with the public votes. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yes. D Well, I know that when you're in a smaller community, I live in Mesquite C and, F uh, when we have, F uh, a local election, D say for our mayor and so forth they really, F uh, give a lot of information in the local newspaper, not in the, not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper, E I mean, they, they just give it a small portion of the newspaper, C but the local newspaper really goes into, F uh, quite a bit of history about the candidate C and, F uh, C and then they have, they raise a, they raise two sides C and, F uh, there's a pro and a con side C and, F uh, you can really, F uh, feel comfortable in, F uh, evaluating that, F uh, candidate by, F uh, that method. F Uh, I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth. D Now, I wouldn't say that about the <noise> larger cities though, and the, and the country on, D like, the presidential. F Uh, E I mean, they've got people that are running that are admitted, F uh, criminals and admitted <laughter> crooks. D You know, I'm sorry, C but I don't believe in them turning a good, F uh, F uh, a new leaf unless they have the Lord that has done that to them. C And, F uh, without the Lord, they can't do it.
