Hello Hi. <Inhaling> My name's Gail. I'm calling from Texas. F Oh, what a deal. Took long enough to find you. Yeah, seems like they take forever any more, C but, F um, D so did you hear what the topic was did she tell you, okay. Great, D well, if you're ready, then, F uh, I'll just go ahead and start. Okay, hold on <beep>. Okay, D well I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women. Seems like, F um, to me, everything is just changing so much that it's almost like, F um, you can't keep up with things any more, C and everything is, F uh, ther, everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women, I personally, I'm a stay home mom, C and I like it the way it used to be. Are you, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Ho, how many kids do you have? Two? Are they young, C or, Five and two. I have two, C and mine are two and nine months, C so, F um, being, being home is real, I, I just am fortunate because I don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home, C and, F uh, I just, it's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who's, who's a working, F uh, lady, a working mom, C and, D you know, these people have secretaries and these high power jobs, C and it just seems like, F um, she, she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care, C and, F uh, I just think, I, I, I just don't agree with that. I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and, and being family, more family oriented than, than not. D You know, it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other, C and I hope it just doesn't get to where, D you know, there's more women, more and more women going into the work force. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well I find that I, whenever I have to, whenever I'm in a group of people and we're discussing things, D like just over the weekend I visited my family, and some cousins I hadn't seen in a long time, C and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing, C and, F uh, D you know, D well, I had my baby with me, C and I found that all I talked about was my baby, which was fine with me, C but it's like, D you know, here these people are, they're going to school, getting degrees, making all this money, C and, D you know, they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages, <laughter> D you know, like I, because I didn't have really all that much to talk about, F uh, where career and things like that were concerned, C and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes, which is too bad, because, D you know, I, I feel like I don't, obviously I don't get paid for my job, C but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes <laughter> working in an office for staying home that's what I figure, <laughter> I'm worth a lot just for what I do every day, C but, D you know, I don't know, this is kind of a, F um, at, at least here I've noticed, I'm not from here, I'm from Colorado, C but I've really noticed that there are a lot of, F uh, a lot more people that are more comfortable, at least, with some women being home and, at least in the circles I've travelled and in the church that I go to, D you know, that men don't treat you like you don't know anything, generally speaking. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, yeah, I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem, definitely. D Well, Hello Hi. I'm Sandy. I'm in Texas, too. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? Yes. Yeah. Okay, Yeah. So am I. D You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you, E I mean, that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before, C but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do, D you know I don't know, E I mean I think sometimes some of the, the women's lib though, is kind of like they wanted it all, D you know, C and you can't have everything I don't, I don't think that you can have, E I mean, there's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be C and to me that's more important. Two. Uhhuh. Five and two. D Well, I agree, E I mean, C but, I, I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work, too, saying, D you know, you should stay home, D you know, otherwise your children aren't going to, D you know, turn out, or whatever because that's not fair to, D you know, D like the single moms that have to work, C or, if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever, E I mean, I think it's got to be a personal choice, C and, it's nice that, that we could have the choice to stay home. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, C and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as D like job sharing or, D you know, even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff, C and I think that's really important that, that they do that C and they realize there's a need for that, C and, F um, I don't know, I found when I did do some work when my son was young, it was like contract work, C and it wasn't where I had to be there every day, C but, E I mean, we were going to the doctor once a week, C so, I don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the <laughter> doctor.
