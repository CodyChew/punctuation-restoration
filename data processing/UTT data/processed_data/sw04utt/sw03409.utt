F Um, I think I'm down to one. D Well, no. I was pulling your leg. I, I, D well, the way I'd like to try and use it is, F um, you, you, you make your purchases at, at prime buying time C and then you pay that off and don't use it until, F uh, it's paid off. That's, that's my ideal way <laughter>. Emergencies come along, C and I C and I use it. F Uh, D like, F uh, my car, F uh, had a major problem, and seven hundred dollars, C and F uh, things just come up C and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I, I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards, C and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble C so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and got out of it. I just. Yeah. . Yeah, yeah. D Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there. Our, our only credit card is Sears, C so C and I have that for automotive purposes. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's just too easy, basically, F uh, just get yourself in trouble with those. I see. Yeah. F Uh, I wouldn't mind, F uh, D you know, getting back into one if they would, D you know, you start out at a low limit, C and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit C and, C and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred C and I can never go over that or something D like that, then that's fine, C but they <inhaling> eventually get's up there to five thousand, ten thousand, whatever fifty thousand <laughter> forget it, I don't want that. Yeah. C So, I don't know, just, F uh, writing checks is just as easy I guess. Yeah, D well, really, what, what can you. Other than, you use them or you don't use them. You like them C or you don't like them. C So. I guess, F uh, they don't care if we end it early. C So, F uh, hopefully, F uh, you have a good Thanksgiving. That's coming up, C and. C And, then, F uh, maybe we'll talk again. Yeah. Texas is the big one. <Laughter> Okay, then. D Well, bye now. D So how many, F um, credit cards do you have? F Oh, my gosh, I wish I was that way. Is that why you said I had more experience than you? Oh. D Well, how, how do you use your credit card? E I mean, do you just keep it in reserve, C or. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. How, how do you use it? <Laughter>. Yeah that's understandable, D exactly. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, actually I do have quite a few more credit cards than you have <laughter>. F Um, C and I use them, D you know, D like my American Express I use for, D you know, gas, things like that, C and I pay that off monthly, C and then, F um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, D you know, I do have them up there a little bit, C but, F uh. I try not to use them too often. C But living in this area, F uh, D like I live fifteen miles west of Washington, D C it's a very expensive area <laughter>. C So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, D well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that. Uhhuh. D Now are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card, or? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, F um. Right, right. D Well, well that's great. F Um, everyone I know here uses, F um, credit cards like they're going out of business <laughter> to be honest with you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the only other one I have, I have D like a Diner's Club through my, F um, where I work C so that I use, because I travel some. C So I use that, C and I don't really have to worry about that, because I only use it for business, C so I automatically have the money to pay it off. C But. F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, <laughter> the temptation's too great. F Um. Yeah, that's true, that's true, C but. C So, I guess, F uh, we've kind of exhausted this, F uh, topic <laughter>. Yeah, you can't say too much about it really. Uhhuh. Okay, you, too. Yeah, may be, you're the furthest person, actually, that I've talked. I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. Yeah. Yeah, C so. O, okay, byebye.
