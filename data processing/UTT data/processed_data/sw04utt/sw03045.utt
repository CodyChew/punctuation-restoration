<Beep> Okay. F Uh, do you own a P C by the way? I'm guessing you probably do. F Oh. I see. Right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. C And what kinds of things do you use it for when you us, when you go to their hous, houses to them? Yeah. F Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Great. Yeah. F Oh, sure. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, I tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly. F Uh, F Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah. F Um, I n, I'm a, a writer by profession C and, F uh, when, when I was first here in, in Dallas or in Plano, F um, and was finally able to, A this is, F oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because <laughter>, I thought, F oh, they're so wonderful. D Well, then, F um, Yeah, <laughter> ours really needs to have some work done on it C but, C but then my husband, F um, worked at T I C and I got a, F um, A this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, C but he got a, F um, <lipsmack> F uh, the, the T I professional and brought that home C and I learned Wordstar on that, C and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter. Uhhuh. Yeah. Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect? C Or, Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, yeah. That's probably where you've used it. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, I have that on my, F uh, computer here C and also, F um, I do some work at U T D C and, F uh, that's what they have there C and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the langu, D you know, already know the, the software. C And, F um, I don't know from my own experience, F um, WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have. It may be improved by now C but, Yeah, it's, F uh, Wordstar was never very intuitive to me. E I mean D you know, you, some of the commands just had nothing to do with, D you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the com, computer C but, F uh, E I mean like going, F um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, D you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using. Yeah. C And, C but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways. C And you, C and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, F uh, research or anything like that where you have to, F uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. Because it keeps track of all your footnotes. Yeah, C and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, D you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, F um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you. <Lipsmack> C So, D you know, it's just, Yeah. Yeah. C And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper <laughter> and you had to go back and retype everything, C and F oh, it was just awful. C So, F um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled. C But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled <laughter>. C So, F um, D well, I have not really paid much attention because I clock, although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes C so, F um, if you, F um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C s. D Well, F um, I was a technical writer for many years, F um, C and my husband and I actually met in a computer company. F Um, I was a tech writer C and he was an engineer. C And, F uh, C so I did tech writing for a number of years. <Laughter>. F Oh, sure. <Laughter> Got a problem, F huh? <Laughter> F Um, F Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, F huh? <Laughter>. C But, F um, I have, F um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, F um, I have also done F oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing. C And, F um, <lipsmack> for a while I had a, F um, <lipsmack> F uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist. C So I did some advertising and P R C but, F um, now I'm, actually I'm, I'm not working anymore. I'm a student, I'm a graduate student C so I'm doing a lot of writing C but, F uh, now all of the sc, scholastic majors though, <Laughter> I've done a little, a lot of different kinds, C but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers C so that's been really great. C And, F uh, I'm, C so I'm real spoiled. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Good. That's great. Yeah. D Well, those are skills that she certainly w, is going to need early on C and, D you know, <lipsmack> the, C and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children. C So, F um, I think that that would be a real, a real, F uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, F uh, do it early, C so. F Uh, do yo, d, F Oh, neat. Yes. Right. F Oh, great. Right <laughter>. That's great. D Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life, C so <laughter>. Might as well start now, F huh? <Laughter>. D Well, Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly. This is really going to be fun I think, C and, F um, my husband is a ham radio operator C and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the, I don't have one in my home here. My, F um, <lipsmack> parents have one C and they live just about three miles away, C so we use that one. C And my inlaws also have one, C and they're almost as close. They're in Richardson. F Um, usually, F uh, word processing something, F um, <lipsmack> such as, F oh, forms for things, F uh, C also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years. C And we got, F uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E. C And I have a sisterinlaw who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district. C And so she got me copies of, F uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs, C and so we use those C and there's some, whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game, C so, that's part of it. F Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. F Uh, his resume, his, F uh, letter, he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. F Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing. Yeah. I'm, F uh, my father had a software company, C and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that C and we're hoping that they can put <talking> together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here <talking>. C But, F um, they're kind of <talking> old older C so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it. F Oh. I have one of those. Yeah. Mines broke at the moment, C but <laughter>. F Oh. Yeah, I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, F uh, I did some typing for my father when he had the company C and so I learned that on there too, that was, I haven't. That's the one that my father, D well, I guess I have used it once or twice. F Uh, it's the one that's on my fatherinlaw's computer. He's got on I B M. C And, F uh, C so that's the program that they're using there. That's what I've heard. Uhhuh. Yeah, you had to, memorize it, C and, F Oh. F Oh, that's neat. F Oh, how wonderful. That, I had heard that that was better. That was a better one. Yeah. Yeah, I agree <laughter>. <Talking>. Not too much. What kind of, what kind of things do you write? F Oh <baby_talking>. <Baby_crying> <<talks to her baby>>. Go talk to Daddy about it. Excuse me. <<Talks to her baby>> Go on and talk to Daddy about it <baby_crying>. Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you. C But you don't need to drag it down the hall <baby_crying>. <Noise> Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged <laughter>. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah. I'm anxious some day to have one here. I'm, C and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again C so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing. My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer, C so. Yeah. I've, That's right. Uhhuh. Yeah. We've been, we've been, F uh, writing a story together. C And so I, C and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, D you know. C And so I decided D well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type <laughter>. C So we'll slowly learn just to type here C and C then C then put the story in. Yes, yes. I agree. Yeah.
