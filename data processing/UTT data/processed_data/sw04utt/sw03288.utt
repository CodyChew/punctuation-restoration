Hi. C So, F uh, what was the last car repair you had? Oh. F Oh, no. Did you crack the block or what? Yeah, I see. You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though. That can be pretty serious. F Oh, I guess it's been awhile for me. I'd sa, it's been about a year. Yeah, I had the, F uh, the water pump break on my car. Yeah, I was traveling, F uh, I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving C and it broke like in the middle of nowhere. C So, I had to get it towed and then fixed C and big pain. Yeah, that's where I was. Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride. Yeah <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, so is mine <laughter>. Yeah, I'm hoping mine gets me through. I got until May until I'm out. C So when I cross that one I'll be okay. F Oh, that's nice <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is C and it's not worth it <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, I got new tires last winter too C so I'm like, D well, that's the last major purchase for this thing. It's not worth it. Yeah. Yeah, we get some killer winters up here in the mountains. Yeah. Lot of snow and a lot of cold. Yeah, at times there's a lot of it. You got to D like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance. Yeah, I haven't had a big problem with that though. C So I've been pretty lucky there. Yeah, that's usually pretty good. You just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it. Yeah. I usually like to do most repairs on my own though. Yeah, just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't. Yeah. C Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> More fun things to do. <Laughter>. D Well, that's nice. Yeah. One is bad enough <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah, I was just wondering that <laughter>. Yeah, I didn't either. Yeah, this must be a, a hard category. <Laughter> Just recently I was kind of laughing when I, when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, F uh, I had to have my, F uh, radiator flushed C and it was getting rusty. C And the thing that they forgot to do was to, F um, to also look at the hose, C and I had gone about F oh, two days with my new radiator flushed C and the hose burst. C So I was stranded out on the highway <laughter>. No, I, I didn't do that thank goodness, C but, F uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, D you know, left to do that C but it cost me all kind of money, D you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it. C So that was, that was a horrible experience just recently. Yes, yes. I know. I know. What about you? Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh, I know. I know. Especially when you're out on the highway. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I know, D well, D you know, F uh, living in Dallas, D you know we've got, F uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic C and, F uh, that was, that was horrible. D You know to have the, D you know, your car is fuming and everything. It's already a hundred degrees you <laughter> don't need that too. F Oh, shoot <lipsmack>. C But my car is getting old. D See it's about six years old now, C so. Yeah, C so I got it right out of college C and so it's, F uh, it's starting to show the wear and tear now. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, that, F uh, that was my graduation present to myself, C so. Yeah. Yeah, I know C so C but gosh, it's really starting to, to wear C so I've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car. Go, C because I can't, F uh, I don't know if I want to, D you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. I agree with you there. C So I don't know, F uh, C because I, I need to have it tuned, D you know, tuned up and A I don't know, replace some of the belts. C And I was looking at the, F uh, tires need to be replaced C and so I was thinking just a lot of money I'm, might as well buy me a new car for that. Uhhuh. D Well, you have to, in Pennsylvania, boy, <noise> you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, F huh? Uhhuh <noise>. F Oh, really? F Oh, okay. C So, Uhhuh. D Well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D well, rust and the, and the body too, F huh? Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> D Well, I think they get the new Zbart stuff and everything to where you can, F um, Uhhuh. Yeah, C and go like that C so. Do you? Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, I, I think I'm getting too old for all that. My, F uh, I had four brothers C and they used to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff C so I can, I can do all that stuff C but I, I think I'd much prefer to pay the twentytwo ninetyfive to, to go have it done now C so I can get my hands dirty. C So, yeah. I'm just getting, getting to that age I guess. You just don't have, your time becomes very precious C so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore <laughter>. Absolutely, absolutely. C So, yeah, I'm trying to, D you know, I just need one, I had two cars there for a while C so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run. C And yeah, C so C but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them. C And yeah, C so that, Yes, one was bad enough. C But I think I got rid of the wrong one <laughter>. I soon, I need a lot of repairs done on, on this one C so yeah, that was, F uh, that was something else <<pause>>. D Well, are our five minutes up? <Laughter>. <Laughter> I, I didn't, I didn't set the time or anything to, F uh, Yeah, put, D Well, yeah, I guess. F Um, D you know, unless you're, F um, D you know, big doityourselfer. F Um, to, D you know, fix up your own cars C and, C and things like that. C So, C but I guess they were talking about experiences. D You know, I, F uh, F uh, I did, my parents live in Ohio C so I, I do know something about the, D you know, the really cold weather. C And, F uh, I've always lived down here in the south, C and, F oh, I took my car up there to their house C and, F um, I guess I had a crack in the block, C and when I got up there the car,
