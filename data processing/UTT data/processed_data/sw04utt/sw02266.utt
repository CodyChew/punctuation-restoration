All Right. Ladies, first. . Barney Fife, I guess. D Well, some, C so your a homemaker? I guess, that's, the right term nowadays. Yeah. My wife, we have a new one in the house C and she stays home, too, also. F Um, I guess, I have a wide variety. I like watching the T V for things that are interesting, not so much the bor, things that aren't, for example, D like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time, and DIFFERENT STROKES. C But I like SIXTY MINUTES, PRIME TIME LIVE. Of course, I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES. I like the oldtimey ones, TOM AND JERRY. There you go. Right. JOHNNIE QUEST. the good ones. F Um, D now if I'm ever home during the, during the day on a vacation day, I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually, because he's just, he's one of my idles. C And then, F uh, C but I don't know, it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, D you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings. C And so, F uh, D now I do, with the COSBY SHOW, I have seen it a couple of times C and, I do, I like the show. I just don't watch it. Because of the timing, C but, F uh, some of the crap that's on T V nowadays, it's about. I do watch the special shows that they come out with, the NOVA stuff. And, and, the nature shows. C But, I think there's enough out there to pick from. I'm not, we don't have cable to the point of, of the H B O or any of that stuff. Yeah. C But, F uh, Huhuh. Sure. F Oh, me. F Oh, no. <Laughter>. Ouch. Fifteen years. Bet they hated that. F Oh, goodness. Yeah. Really. I used to watch, F uh, I can recall, this might age me, date me here, F uh, I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT. SECRET STORM. D Well, I think they were back to back, and black and white. I was just a youngster C and I was like, F oh, my gosh. Still be on. Yeah. Now they got a lot of other crap involved. C And so, You're right. I think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable, C And that could be, F uh, I have to agree with you. D You know keep them on the channel eleven, channel twenty one. The nature stuff, D you know <laughter>. Huhuh. Huhuh. Huhuh. D Well, sounds like you got your hands full there, C and I do appreciate speaking with you. Have you gotten your catalog yet? Yeah. I just spoke with Jim. I just got my in the mail C and it inspired me to make more phone calls <laughter>. F Oh, really. Yeah. Give them your pen number. *sp Have a good day. Byebye. Byebye. F Oh, no. D Well, I don't find a lot of time to watch T V. C And a lot of time, I find it during the day when, when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep, C so I watch a lot of reruns, old shows, Like DICK VAN DYKE, all those old crazy shows. Yeah <laughter>. I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. Yeah. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah, I am. I stay home with two kids. Huhuh. Huhuh. Huhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. You sound like my husband. He likes TOM AND JERRY and, F uh, BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because, with two kids C and, D you know, I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch C or, I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN, <Laughter> C And I watched that for D like, F oh, ten or fifteen straight years, C and then I had, D well, D you know, I'd eat D like at work, we'd have a T V or whatever. C And then, F um, as my kids got older and started, D you know, recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good <laughter>. C So I gave it up. Yeah. I watched, I had watched it since it started. C So, F Uh, now I, I don't know who the characters are, C and, F um, I'll turn it on every once in awhile C and I don't recognize anybody, C so I guess that's a good sign <laughter>. Huhuh. F Oh, yeah. D Well, D see, you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM, and the EDGE OF NIGHT. Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah, we used to, my mother watched all that stuff, too. C And AS THE WORLD TURNS. I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may, still on or not. It was not too long ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. We do, C and it's real interesting, too, the difference in my kids, D like F um, my oldest loved SESAME STREET, And those kind of shows. My younger one doesn't. She's more into WALT DISNEY kind, D you know, we watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C, on tapes, and stuff. She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing C so, C But, F um, we do a lot of kid watching. Sure. It was fun. No, I don't think so. F Oh, D well, D see I don't really. I've had a few people call me, C but, I've never made one. Yeah. I need to get brave <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I need to do. Thanks.
