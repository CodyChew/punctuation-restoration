We're supposed to talk about crime in the city. C And, F uh, seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't it? D Well, it is, C but our crimes up here, F uh, as I think it must be in most cities now, C but, F uh, I was listening to the news the other day C and they said they thought a lot of it, the reason it was up so was because of the, F uh, so many people are without work nowadays, economy's so bad <noise>. <Laughter>. That's a good point <noise> <laughter>. That's just what they quoted over the news. I don't know if I believe that or not, C but, it, it does seem up C and, What kind? D Well, we got a, I think we got a pretty good newspaper. F Uh, we have two, the MORNING NEWS and the, F uh, TIMES HERALD. MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation. I think it's a pretty good, it's a locally owned paper. The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, F uh, L A, or somewhere. C But, D Well, they don't, no, not really, F uh, they don't play it up, I don't think. F Uh, <lipsmack> C but there, there is too much of it, D you know, F uh too many homes broken into. We had our, our, fact about, F uh, last year sometime our home was broken into. We, Yeah, we, F uh, F uh, I didn't think ours ever would be burgled into, burgled, C but, so many in our neighborhood had been, C and, F uh, because we live on a corner and back up to a real, F uh, highly traveled main street. C But, F uh, we were, so, F uh, Sort of, yeah. C And I never did get a security system, C but since that happened, I certainly have. It's, F uh, <throat_clearing> F uh, I guess <lipsmack>, E excuse me, just a standard. F Uh, <sniffing>, <lipsmack> with the, F uh, all the doors and the, F uh, infrared thing, D you know, motion detector. Pre, Pretty standard. Yes, yes. It's monitored and all that. C And, I think, F uh, the thing that makes a lot of noise would, would suffice. I really do. C But, F uh, this deal that was part of it for, D you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever. C And, F uh, C but it, F uh, the monitoring is not that bad, though C because, F uh, F uh, we've goofed it up, D you know, several times you'll hit the wrong key, not intentionally or something C and <sniffing>, C and they call back pretty quickly, C so I guess it's, D you know, I think it's all right. C But I, to answer your question, I think, F uh F uh, I think, F uh, that is a pretty good deterrent in itself, whether it, Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> D Well, it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. Tha, F uh, that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway <noise>. Supposedly. Who knows, D you know. C But that's a selling point. C And I think they're probably, I think it probably does these things or <breathing> sur, supposedly pretty good. <Lipsmack> Boy, they sure advertise them, D you know, so many of them nowadays. C But, F uh, D well don't, don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there? I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's. Down here, we seem to, C or, C or not here, C but the statistics seem to say that. I don't know. Is that right? I would gather probably from drugs. C And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere. C But, I don't think there's anyplace, used to, years ago, you thought, D well, these little small cities and all, <lipsmack> wouldn't have that problem, C but they do. We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it, F uh, as anyone, D you know. That's a good question. I don't know, I don't know what the solution is. I really don't. Yeah. Yep. Th, C and nothing seems to change. C And, F uh, I'm not sure that anything will because these, if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it F uh, C but, they want to buy it, C so, Supply and demand. Long as somebody wants to buy it, somebody going to provide it for them <noise>. C So, I don't know, I don't got, D you know, I don't know what the solution is, I really don't <sniffing>. I don't think anyone does, in fact. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I, that's, sure. F Uh, I, I think it's s, st, statistics, obviously, vary greatly. I always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place. Do you really believe that? E I mean, it, it's been up every year for many years C and the economy hasn't been, this bad for so long, has it? Yeah. What kind of newspaper do you get down there? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. D, do they, do they play up the local crime angles C or d, C or do they, Uhhuh. Yeah. Really? C So this is a topic of personal interest. Uhhuh. Yeah. C So, C so you saw this happening in your neighborhood C and you figured it wouldn't happen to you. Yeah, what kind of system do you have? Uhhuh. Is, Is this, is this one with some company that, that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff? Yeah. D Well, is that a necessary feature to have somebody, D you know, at the other end of the line C or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise? Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C S, C s, C so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system <noise>. C And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line? How does it do that? Uhhuh. Sure. D Well, yeah, F uh, I, I think it's the murder capital of the country now. Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. C S, C s, C so, what's the solution? C And all these politicians make, make hay over, D you know being anticrime, C but they haven't seemed to have changed anything. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, what,
