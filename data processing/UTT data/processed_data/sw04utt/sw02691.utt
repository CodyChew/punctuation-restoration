Okay, Jay, where do you live in Texas? In Dallas. What's that, the I Thirty and Central express? Okay, yeah. Right. Yeah. F Oh, is that right? F Oh, how about that? It's a new home? About eight years. Oh. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. D Well we we live in a brick story and a half, F uh, Cape Cod style, I guess you'd call it. C And, F uh, have a big sun room on the back of it. No, it doesn't have <laughter>. With openness and light? I understand that, I would love that too <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, this is very traditional. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do you have children at home? Three? F Oh, boy. You still need space, plenty of space <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh <<faintly>>. Uhhuh. D Well, It's, F uh, F oh, about twentyfive thousand, twentyfive hundred square feet, I guess. It's four bedrooms and two baths and that, It has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room, and then the big room on the back. F Uh, Uhhuh. Two and two, uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. I was just reading an article, F uh, that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas, F uh, for sale by the Reso, Resolution Trust Com, Corporation? Repossessed <laughter>. I, I guess so. Uhhuh. That's discouraging if you own property <laughter>. Few years. Uhhuh. Right. D Well our daughter and soninlaw moved up, back up here. A He's from Texas, but course she's from here, F uh, about a year and a half ago, and had their house on the market down there, C and they never did sell it. C So they stayed six months, C and she got her job back, C and he got a job down there. C Because, Huhuh. Nope. They live in Rowlett. Have you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What college are you teaching at? Oh. Uhhuh. The only one I know is Richardson <laughter>. Garland, uhhuh. Yeah. D Well I enjoyed talking to you. I hope so <laughter>. Right. Okay, thank you, same to you. Byebye. I live in Dallas, F uh, right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state. A And a, uh, it goes east and west, and a north south tollway. It's, no, it's called Six ThirtyFive's the highway. It's the looper that goes around the city C and then, F uh, the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway. Just moved here about, F uh, F oh, F uh, one, about a month ago after twentyone years, two miles to the east. C So, it's a very different house from the typical Dallas, F uh, house. It's about eight years old, it's, F uh, it's a duplex type thing. F Uh, very modern and, F uh, very open and airy light. C So it's different than the, than the long Texas ramblers. Uhhuh. What's your house like? F Oh, great, yeah. C So it's got a lot of o, openness and light, also? F Oh, it doesn't? D Well, that's what my wife really wanted C and so, F uh, Yeah that's, F Uh, our, our last house wasn't too bad, C but it was just too traditional, C and so, if, F uh, the n, the next time, F uh, probably a year and a half from now, we're going to try to build. C So make one really, F uh, contemporary and, and very modern and very open and very light. No, I have three in college. They, they usually, get back for the, at least two of them for the summer, C so, C But, Still need a little bit of space. We, we have a lot less than we had, F uh, recently. Already cut back. How big is your place? F Oh that's good size. Yeah. We, we had, Yeah, we had four bedrooms, two and a half baths, F uh, in the place we just left. C So down, now we're down to, two and two. Uhhuh. C So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home, C but it won't be that long, because we, not for sure, D you know, how long they're going to stay or whatever. D So, F Oh, yes. Yes, C and if you get in the, if, if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal. F Uh, we, we really didn't go that route and didn't look. F Uh, C but, F uh, the planning of them C and the, the housing market probably still going to even go lower. There are many, many houses ju, for sale just by the regular route. D So, F uh, Yeah. C And we just decided, F uh, F uh, sell. C And we got, we got a pretty good price, F uh, for, for what we had. F Uh, not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago. C But that, F uh, that was just the timing. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah, they're not moving very well. For sure. C And that's a good, F uh, example of it. F Oh, yeah. I know where that is. I've been, we've been here for twentyfive years. I'm from Missouri, C and my wife's from Kansas, C so I te, I teach at a college here. C So it's, F uh, it's sort of home now. D So, I'm at, F uh, one of the Brook, F uh, it's called Brookhaven College. It's one of the community colleges. C And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living. C So it's very nice, very convenient. Yeah. D Now Richland College is out, it serves Richardson and, F uh, Garland. C And that's about nine miles to the east of here. C So, F uh, D anyway, D well, it's good to hear from you. C And I hope we, hope we did them some good, F uh, on their little computer dealy. C And, F uh, have a good life, the rest of it. Byebye.
