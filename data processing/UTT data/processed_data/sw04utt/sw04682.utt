<Clicking> Have you had that experience recently? F Oh, yeah. Oh. D Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service. I don't feel like that's as big a problem. I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly. C And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent. F Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time. C But that's it. C But that's, that's probably the worst. My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. F Uh, James Avery. I don't know if you have that up there C but it, it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things C and F uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now C and the catch broke C and she was sitting in school on a carpet C and when she stood up, it caught and broke C and we took it back C and they said F oh, this was just obviously yanked. This was yanked. E I mean they were so rude about it. C And so we wanted a different kind of catch C and she said D well it's not guaranteed. C And I said, D well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed C so do it anyway. C So we got the kind we wanted C and I was really disappointed with that. I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable C and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends C and I called there to see if they had it C and the lady was very nice. C And I said my goodness, I said you've been very nice, what's your name. C And she told me C and I said D well I really appreciate it. I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store C and it turned out she was the assistant manager C so, Right. C So I felt kind of good about that, D you know. I didn't even know the person's name that had given <<mispronounced>> me the hard time or anything C but I just felt like, D well at least I did something. Maybe they'll fix it. They might work on that, D you know. C But I find attitudes are more of a problem. Service is more of a problem. Really. That's really great. Huh. That's really good. It use to be like that. C But, I don't think most places are like that anymore. Recently, I can't really say recently. C But I think about, F uh, about a year ago, F uh, I bought a product from some company down at, F uh, in Atlanta, Georgia. I believe it was one of these, F uh, one of these, F uh, mixers. These, D like these juice machines C and, F uh the, F uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, D you know, perfectly okay C but I found that, F uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting F uh, after, even, despite, D you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, F uh, three weeks of use. C And I don't think it was my fault because i, I, D you know, I had made a point of D like drying it off and cleaning it C but, F uh, it was really, F uh, it was, I had to send it back after D like, D you know, the third week because I realized it was D like, it was not, something was very, very wrong with the blade. F Uh, what about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. D Well at least your talking to somebody who counts <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Right, right. I find, up here in the northeast, we have, F uh, D well w, we have these mail order companies like L L Bean C and, F uh, they are famous for, I guess, having really topnotch service. They've got, F uh E I mean I've, I've, I, I have friends and family who order from them because you can, you can literally, A I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half, C and even after, like eighteen months of, D you know, reasonably satisfactory use, they will accept it in any condition C and they will gladly, no questions asked, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore. F Uh, they'll, they'll actually do things like this. E I mean they're really, they, they go, bend over backwards service wise for you. I've, F uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays, have, they have eight hundred numbers you can call. I guess if, if you call the e, any eight hundred number, F uh, if, you, you can call up e, any eight hundred number directory assistance, and you can get, F uh, the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies. C And, F um, D actually I've tried that with a few companies lately. C And they've, most of them have been pretty good, C but I, I was, one reason why, I, D like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that, F uh, if you buy through Bean or though, F uh, I guess Bean's, one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in, F uh, I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere. They, they are, F uh, they're very good about F uh, insur, D like the customer is always right C and D you know, no matter how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding C and, F uh, they usually get, D you know, they, they make things are, they ma make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well I think, I guess nowadays with the, F uh, with the economy the way it is, I guess, there was a, there was a story on the news tonight about how, because a lot of companies are, F uh, D you know, things are getting rough out there, there's a lot of, D you know, the morale among employees tends to go down and that, in turn, D like, D you know,
