D Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on? I have to agree with you there. I, F uh, I think that, F uh, for once, we should, we shouldn't even be at, at these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, we really don't have too much of a, F uh, real in, we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is. Just let these people fight it out D you know, we've got so many domestic problems, C and, C and what does it cost these people over there, D you know. F Oh, C so how about the Soviet Union. What do you think's going to happen there. The break ups? Uhhuh. That's right, that's right. D Well, all I've seen. <Laughter> Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of, of, of his political affairs. I, I think Bush's kind of followed suit. F Um, international is important, C but, F uh, we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed. F Uh, D you know, C and then there's the homeless issue, C and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, F uh, hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think, C and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending. Right. <Laughter> I agree. We've been writing off way too many bad debts F uh, country bad debts. Exactly. I know it. Right. That's right, you're either liberal or you're conservative, D Well, I think, F uh, it wouldn't hurt, C and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a, a, a real force in, in the, F uh, in Congress, C but, F uh, you're right, there's just too many issues that come up that, F uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue C and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, F uh, we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. He's one of the two, F huh. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, let's see, Senators are in for six years, right C and, F uh, when did you guys vote him into office? F Oh, you're stuck. <Laughter>. I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East. I agree. Absolutely. I think that's great. F Um, I'm glad to see that, C but I, again, I don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, F uh, D well, F uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because I, I don't know, I'm, I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them, C and so, I'm, I'm not much in favor of it, C but I'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money. C But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda, even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody who, who is working on that problem. C And I, I haven't seen that in the last eleven years, C so they don't seem to have a clue. F Oh, I agree. I just, I think we got, once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the, the world bank, and as far as aid is concerned, C and I think there's a limit, C and we passed it a long time ago. Yeah. That's another thing I don't understand is, is, is things like selling technology and, F uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt <Laughter> to me that just doesn't make any sense, as, as much in debt as we are I just, I don't know. I think it's definitely time for a change, C but I don't see anybody, I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and Republicans, C and it's either one way or the other, this it s, seems to be we're turning into a black and white society, you either do it this way C or you do it that way, C and there's no in between C and that, F uh, it obviously isn't working. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, I agree with you. D Well, of course, D you know, we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms, C and, F uh, as soon as, as we can get, of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him C so, it's not too, it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions. He's, F uh, usually on the ninetyeight to two side, he's the one of the two that votes, Yeah, he's, very ineffective, I think. Right. F Oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety. Yeah, we're stuck with him for a little while longer, C but, F uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great, D so, I hate,
