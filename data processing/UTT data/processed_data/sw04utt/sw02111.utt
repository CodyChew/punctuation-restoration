Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive. I live in San Antonio. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio. I used to work for the power company here C and there was discussion for a while about, F uh, building a garbage burning, F uh, electric generation plant C but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time. C And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city C but there isn't any, F uh, advertising campaign. There's just not any push to recycle. I recycle my newspapers and, F uh, alumi, my aluminum stuff. C But, F uh, they make it as hard as possible, it's not very convenient to do. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, where I work now we recycle all the computer paper. C But that's about the extent of it. Yeah, yeah, C And I'm sure that the, F uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so. We sell the paper back to the, F uh, to a paper manufacturing company. D Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think. I, not by much, but it does defray it some. Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. D Well the last time, F uh, someone moved offices in my building C and, F uh, the, F uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes. Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around, I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon C and they're good boxes. C And they were just going to throw them away. Yeah. Huhuh. Right C and, C and these boxes are, you can unfold them. C So, D you know, there, they don't take up much storage space. Yeah, yeah I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away, C so. I thought, D well I was doing them a favor by taking them. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off C so you can't use it anyway. Those C and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the nice lids. Those get thrown away. C And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes. Those are perfect boxes to put files in. What, what I've done in the past, I don't have any now, C but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids, C and you can stack them up and, and leave them out and put things in them, even. Uhhuh, yeah. <Laughter> Yeah D well, D you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever. Uhhuh, yeah. <Laughter>. Yes, yeah. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I live near a Walmart C and there's a big, F uh, F uh, huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front, in fact I think there's two of them, that have several openings, C and it's for recycling C and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category, I don't, maybe there's two for aluminum. C And you don't get paid C but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It gets to be, F uh, I guess you have to make it a habit, E I mean, you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit. Uhhuh. Oh. C And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. D Well, I, thank you. Bye, bye. Where do you live? San Antonio! D Well, F uh, I live in Garland C and we're just beginning to, we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable C but, as far as, F uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that. C So, they're really not full, full force into it, C but they're trying, C so we're attempting it, C but I wish we could do more. Uhhuh. Oh. F Huh. Right, that's what I do. Right, when they put centers and stuff like that. Yeah, D well we have those, F uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans. I don't know if you all have those things around. C And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center, C and you can just stop by. Now everything else like the tra, F uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers C but, C but for aluminum that's real nice C and I started doing that at work. F Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in, C and that's really helped a lot, E I mean, everybody's pitched in C and, D you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can. C So, I really, I really like that, C but, people are really concerned, it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which is really, really sad because, I wish we would do more <throat_clearing>. At work we started, F uh, all the recycling stuff. They're really trying, I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year. C And, F uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off, C but, D you know sometimes it dwindles down. That's good. D Well that's, F uh, at least your trying something. It's just D yeah, it would be nice if it could be more. F Oh do you really. D Well that's a neat idea. Right. D Well that's, that's really good, E I mean at least they're trying. Yeah I know a lot of companies that waste so much that, I'm even trying, D you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building C and, D you know, the nice cardboard boxes that you move, packing boxes. C And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster C and I thought, I don't understand this, D you know. We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff C and, C and here we are wasting. C And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it. Uhhuh. <Laughter> That's exactly what I did. Exactly what I did, exactly. C Because I didn't want to waste that. C And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes. Right. Exactly right, D well that's very good <laughter>. Right, right, I found about five, F uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters. F Oh gosh, so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes, when, D you know, these are perfect, C so. Right, right, right. Uhhuh, right. That's exactly what I do. Uhhuh. They're good for storage and stuff like that. That's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store her, D you know, D like her out dated or, out of, out of season clothes in them C and they're just perfect. Uhhuh. C And they look just as good. That's a smart idea. I think I'll have to try that. That's really cute. They're the exact same thing. That's all they are, they just made them look fancy. You saved me some money. C And you're recycling <laughter>. D Well that's neat. D Well do you all have, F uh, we have places that, F uh, pay for paper to recycle, I know you do yours at work, C but for newspaper. C But ours are real hard to find. That's the one thing that really discourages me. I saved pa, D you know, I recycle paper, C but they, it's almost like they don't want the paper, because they don't pay, at all, E I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay. C And that's really discouraging. E I mean, I just go ahead and take it to the, the regular place, where it's, D you know, they just accept it. C But they, F uh, I think they should yeah, if they want people to recycle I think it's, F uh, D you know, D like the aluminum, D you know, it gets people to, F uh, doing it, D you know, you might, you don't have to pay them a lot. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well that's, that's good. I, the one thing I don't like about the newspaper also is, F uh, D like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk. You have one for paper and one for just your normal trash, C but in, F uh, in the paper one you have to separate. You have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines. You can't throw any of that away C and you can't throw certain file type things away, C and I just think it's such a hassle, it seems like it would be, it would be easy to take it all, I don't know, of course, I don't know all that about recycling C so, it probably is a hassle. C But I do get tired of having to separate paper, D you know. Right, right. C And we had, F uh, a write up in our paper, F uh, this last time at work about, F um, they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash C and every other day they do your recycling trash. C And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had, F uh, dumped all the trash in the same bin. C And when they were questioned about it they said D well, we're running late, C or we didn't have time to do those bins or something C and that's real discouraging. Thinking you're sitting there working to separate it C and then they, Right, right, C so they're, they're really, trying to start keeping an eye out for those, D you know talking to the people again about, D you know, separate them C because that is discouraging when you, when you do that <talking> <<in the background>>. It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans. C But luckily that will all get straightened out C and, C and they'll, they'll start separating them. C Because, I don't mind doing that, I feel like I'm doing, F uh, doing something for the community when I'm doing that. C But D anyway. You too. Bye.
