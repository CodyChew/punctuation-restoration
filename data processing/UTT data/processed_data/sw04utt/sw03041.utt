C So what movies have you seen lately? Oh. D Well, D see that's something I want to see, that's on my list to see. F Oh, okay. F Oh, did you? Oh. D See that's also on my list. A disturbing movie, how do you mean? Right. A switcheroo, F huh? Right. <Laughter>. When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it, Oh. C Because that, that just reminds me of, D you know, D like back in school C and, D you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day <laughter> or something. Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble C but, F um, yeah. Before we found the shopping malls that's <laughter> what we did. <Laughter> Yeah, D well, I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on my list then. Oh. Scandalous? I can imagine. I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is, F huh? F Huh. You just had to find it. You had to wade through it and find it <laughter>. You never quite <laughter> got to, All I know about that woman is that she's an in, incredible marketeer <laughter>. Yeah, C and she's rich C and she, yeah, C so. She knows how to twist this around, F huh? D Well, okay, D see, we're getting back to last year. That's probably the last <laughter> movie I saw. F Um, DANCES WITH WOLVES, I just adored it. How can I tell you. F Um, a couple years ago, I guess, D well, maybe ten years ago I, I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE C and, so, D you know, just the general theme of the whole movie was, F um, pretty, E I mean I really liked it a lot. I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess. F Um, C and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood, D you know, about the American pop, Indian population, C and then everything went away for a couple years, C and now it's back again. C And, D you know, it's sort of a popular view of, F um, what happened way back then. Of course, no one will ever know. Really I don't kn, D Well, who knows. E I mean it, it, it sort of showed D like two different types of tribes D like one was a warring tribe, C and the other one was, F uh, vegetarian kind of, D you know, feel good tribe. D You know, sort of thing, C so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world. Nobody can get along peacefully <laughter>. F Oh, I see. Yeah. F Huh. D Well, I think so. I, F um, I have come to respect a little bit more the, F uh, D you know, what went on here, C but, C but who knows how it's supposed to all end <laughter>. D You know on the, on the broad scope E I mean, <lipsmack> F um, D like if, F uh, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I thin, meaning to me I think about, D you know, just the meaning of, F um, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant. C And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms. And sort of trampling that C and, F uh, C so D you know it, it meant something bigger I think. C But still it was a fantas, I loved the buffalo scene. C And I thought Kevin Costner was just, I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every, three minutes, C but he's the director, D you know. F Um, C but, yeah, I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film. Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast. Yeah. Ate a lot of popcorn. Did it really? F Huh. It made you think. Maybe i, D well, maybe that was, F um, C but there are no answers, D you know. That, that can make you crabby, yes. <Laughter>. Really, that's true. C But it, it's, they sort of candy coated the western story for many years, C and, F um, D you know, when the truth, F oh, D well, it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story C but, Have you seen any other movies? Because you sound like you see a lot. F Oh, okay. F Oh, there you go <laughter>. Oh. Oh. Really? Oh. <Laughter>. F Oh, I'll have to write that down. Wow. <<Very faint>> I'll have to write that, have you, have, did you see TEXASVILLE? Are you into, Larry McMurtry? Yeah. F Um, I, I read a lot of Larry McMurtry books C and TEXASVILLE is just like that. It's D like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other it's, it's, D you know, C and it's just sort of a, D Well, I saw, F um, lately I've seen SOAP DISH. Which was a, C and that was a lot of fun. It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things. Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was okay. It was not, F um, not a wonderful film C but it was, E I mean it was, it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen. I saw THELMA AND LOUISE. A couple of days ago, and really liked that. Actually I saw it twice because I <laughter> liked it so much. C And it's very, it's really disturbing but a good movie. D Well, it was, F um, <lipsmack> let's see. The, F um, it's, it's different, it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, D you know, shoot 'em up kind of film. C But it's with women in it instead of men C so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing. C And it made me think a lot about, D you know, you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this C but you might not be so D you know, so encouraging, of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it. C So, that was kind of interesting. I've, C but I really enjoyed it. C So, I w, Yeah, that's kind of what it was. Right. They had started out with that, then they got into lots of trouble. Uhhuh. Yeah. I also saw that Madonna movie. It's <lipsmack> TRUTH OR DARE C and that was pretty scandalous. Yeah, it was kind of, yeah, Madonna she's pretty trashy. C And so it was, it was interesting <laughter>. Righ, D well, I think she kept saying that, F uh, they talked about her, it, it was a film of her concert, F um, tour she had taken through all, all around the world. C And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome, C and she, kept saying that her show was not garbage. It had a social message to it C and, Right. We never quite believed that, C so. I thought that was pushing it a little bit C but, she, She is. She's rich <laughter>. she's smart at what she does. She knows how to do that. Yeah. What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it? Really? Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. I know, I was, I wondered if, F uh, the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but I wonder I thought the, C because they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the, the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe C and that, D you know, that was so wonderful that they done that C and they, F uh, F uh, I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film, if it, D you know, you didn't, hear any press about that. I thought it was a very interesting movie. Right. Uhhuh <laughter>. Right. Right. Uhhuh. I know the <laughter>, D Well, that's good. That was, that was, it was, it was good. I looked at my watch only a few times, which is a good thing. C But it put me in a really, it put me in a really bad mood, I don't know why. Yeah, we di, there were three of us who went. We were just all grou, really grouchy when it was over. C So we decided that may be the mark of a good film. It made us think. C And so, we were grouchy. We felt guilty for being, <Laughter>. I know C and we, we had <laughter>, nothing to do with it. We were not responsible, C but we still felt the thick blame for, what had gone on. We could have, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, Righ, I do. I'm just out of school C so I've seen, a lot of mo, <laughter> don't have a job C so I shouldn't go see movies all the time. F Um, I rented a good movie, F um, called CINEMA PARADESO which is an Italian movie which is probably the best movie I've seen ever. It was just, wonderful. It's, uh, story about a little boy in a Italian, a little Italian village, C and he, F um, owns a, F um, C or he works in a, a movie th, theater C and it w, it helps the projectionist. There's a little, F oh, an old man who's the projectionist C and he befriends this old man, C and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years. C And it's just, E I mean, if you don't mind reading subtitles, I thought I had to kind of get beyond that. Those little, D you know, reading the little words at the bottom of the screen C but, F um, F oh, I just laughed and cried C and, I really loved it. That was a, a great one. C And other than that I, No, I had, I hadn't. I had read, F um, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW C and C but that's out on video now C and I haven't seen it. C But I was interested in reading TEXASVILLE before I saw the movie. Did you like it? Right. Uhhuh.
