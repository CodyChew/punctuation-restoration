F Uh, C so, do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I agree, F uh, with, with both of those things, C but, F uh, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, the only prob, the only problem I see with term limitations, F uh, is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in, with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar, D you know, there, there is a learning curve and that, D you know, you d, can't just send someone off to Washington and expect, D you know, his first day to be an effective, F uh, Congress person. F Uh, I think, I think there really is a, there's a lot they need to learn, D you know, when you get there. Uhhuh. Yeah C but, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, the other, the other thing that, F uh, bothers me about our system is just that, F uh, in, for, for, in, in, in Congress the amount of power any, any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there C so it's, D you know, for, D you know, F uh, C so unless you have actual, D you know, across the board s, F uh, limitations, the, F uh, D you know, the idea of, D well, we're going to just, we're, I'm, I'm just going to, D you know, vote, vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work, D you know, it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, E I mean, l, t, I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, D you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Generally, I don't think they are. F Uh, my, my personal opinion is that, F uh, the politicians are out for their own good because they, they're entrenched. They don't ever have to go out and get a real job. They just stay in their current job, you know what I mean? I think by putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems. F Uh, C but it has to be not just at the national level but at the, D you know, the state and the local level, too. I know some senators, C and I don't know which ones, C but they've been in office since the, the nineteen forties C and I, th, they've never had a job. E I mean they've never gone out in the real world and, and paid normal taxes. I know they pay taxes, C but they don't D you know, they, they get paid a hundred and twentyfive grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit C and, D you know, I'm going, like, I, I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am C and they work less, D you know, less than I do. <Laughter>. I think, I think that's true, however, I think that's always been true. E I mean, that's true of the Presidency, too, C and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years. C And, F uh, They, E I mean, there is a lot to learn, C but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up. I think two years is too short. I think it would have to be extended, F uh, D you know, a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms C or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a Congressman. F Uh, C but maybe standardizing on, on a, a four year term for Congress Senate and the, the Presidency and then, F uh, staggering them so that you don't, we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. Uhhuh. I think, I think that that's true, C but then you have, you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. F Uh, the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency. E I mean, the action isn't in West Virginia. I hate to tell the s, the senator from West Virginia this information, C but it really doesn't e, ar, the world does not revolve around West Virginia F uh, as far as this country is concerned, the world does revolve around D C, D you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned, the national politics C and the C I A is a, a very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia, yeah, D you know, it might only be two hour drive from here, but that's a two hour drive C and, F uh, D you know, it, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that C or is it the F B I. I don't remember, C but I think there's, Yeah, that's officially. E I mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true. C But I, I think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, F uh, turn, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years. I think there are, E I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain. C But I think that, F uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them, E I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, F uh, during the incidents where they were, D you know, D like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills C and they're bouncing checks all over the place F uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.
