Are you in the middle of anything? The whole thing? Did the framing and all? F Huh. Maybe you and I should get together. Because when I had my last big project, I had the contractor do the framing *slash error C and I did all the sheetrocking <laughter> and the interior work <throat_clearing>. Ye, Yeah. My wife wishes I hadn't done that. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. <Cough>. Yeah <sniffing>. Did you, you framed it in f, F uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage C or was it stuff that was already, F uh, enclosed? Brand new. C A, C and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing? Uhhuh. Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground? On the piers? Did, You had those poured C or you did them yourself? You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? F Huh. D Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of <laughter> <noise>. No I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job. Those are nice. They're pretty forgiving, D you know. You can always tear stuff out and redo it. It's a, <Throat_clearing>. Right <throat_clearing>. Yeah. I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, F uh, a backrest and all that stuff. I, <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes C so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts. C And, F uh C and then the rest of it I just did. A, a contractor friend helped me, F uh, with some of the, F uh, foundation work C but, F uh, it was pretty, it was about four or five hundred square feet. The same size as the addition that I just put on C so. <Throat_clearing> Yeah. It's, F uh, not that expensive. I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, F uh, D you know, no less than that. Co, cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together. Yeah. I'd be surprised if it wasn't, F uh, cheaper where you are. D Well, yeah. It probably comes from where you are. Most <throat_clearing>. When I drive through that area, that's all I see is pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards. <Laughter> <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Right. East Texas. F Huh. Yeah, my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, F uh, D you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, F uh, pavers on top of that C so. That's a lot easier. <Static> No. I'm not in the middle of anything. I've just, about the last thing I did about maybe, F oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. C So, I guess that, Yeah. That, that was fairly large undertaking. A, a, it's a bedroom and a walkin closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house. F Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking. That was the only thing we didn't, D you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that C and. <Laughter> Yeah, that's the exact opposite. We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up. We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work C and that's it because you have, D you know, get those joints to go together C and whatever you have to put in there to get the, s, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that. I di, we didn't know a thing about any of that C and so, <Laughter>. It's, it looked very hard to do C so, we figured D well just, I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. C So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living. C But, Probably so C and I, we'd never done it C so we just left it alone. C But that's, I guess, I'm only twentyone C so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much. C So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, D you know, for my parents C so. It was brand new. We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house C so it was, F Uh, D well my dad knew how to do most of it, D you know. He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books C and then he just started doing it. I don't know. He, D well he did all the flooring himself. He put the whole, the whole floor in C and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. C And then we were, put a, D like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just D like a, off the side of that after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. It's not, D you know, it's not enclosed. It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park C and it's, F Uh, it's off the ground. Uhhuh. It's on about F uh, twentytwo inch piers, something like that. D So. F Uh, no, those, those are, we did those ourselves C so. Yeah. Exactly, C so. It's, Yeah, those ar, those are, we'd, I've done one, I helped somebody do one of those before. Those are, those are, D you know, you can buy them in kits C but we didn't do that way. C But it's, Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's not near, like building a house or anything C but, Yeah, those are nice. Especially when you get done, you've got something, D you know. I don't know, I like them. You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have a barbecue C or, Yeah, that sounds nice. All done by yourself, F huh? Designed, <Static> Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty, that's a good size deck. C So, yeah. That's, Yeah. That's not, Yeah, that's good. That's not bad at all. Didn't have to, th, the wood may it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, D you know. To get, to get good lumber it costs, I don't know about Dallas, C but arou, even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all. I was surprised. It's probably more there. <Laughter> Yeah, yeah, that it probably does. I, I'm not sure C but, <Noise> Yeah. It's nothing but woods up here, down here. Yeah. I don't, I haven't, E I mean, I haven't, I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually. C And, C but that was just when I was a kid C so I don't really know what the cost of living is even D like in Dallas anymore. C But it's, I don't know, we're a college town C so that doesn't help us out any. We have, gas is a dollar t, dollar twelve a gallon, C so that's probably about what you're paying C so. Yeah. You've got something going all the time.
