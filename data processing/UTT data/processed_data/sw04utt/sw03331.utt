D Well, what I believe is one of the major pro, F uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, F um, we do not have enough discipline C and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now. F Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined, C and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different. D You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom. Yeah, that's right, that's right. My, my daughter's in the, F um, fourth grade C and, F um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach C and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with. Uhhuh. D Well, they, they just don't do that any more. C But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, F um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that. C And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid C and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school. C And, F um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems. Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, C and D you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not. D You know, I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that C but, F um, C and what else, F um, I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire. I have heard stories, F uh, from other parents that I know of, A their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs, F Oh, yeah, I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers C and, D you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school. F Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job <laughter> right now. Uhhuh, C so. <Laughter> You don't have any children in school? Don't have any kids. Yeah, okay, C so this is probably a real hard subject for you. Yeah. Okay, D well, I guess, F um, we can discontinue our call now. It was a joy in talking with you. Okay, thanks. Bye. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I agree with that. You were? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. From what I understand, they act up pretty bad <laughter>. What, F uh, grade is your daughter in? Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, no, uhhuh. They always had a paddle in our school. <Laughter>. I know. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No. Really? F Ooh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. <Laughter>. F Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job. C But, then, what do I know, <laughter> I don't have any kids. No, none at all <laughter>. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Okay. D Well, it was good talking to you too. We'll see you, byebye.
