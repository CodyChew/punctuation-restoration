Hello, my name is Donna, C and I'm calling from Plano, Texas. F Oh, okay. F Um, would you like me to go first? Okay, F um I have three children, F um, two, two who are in regular school, F uh, eleven year old, an eight year old, C and then my little one, three year old, is in, F um, a University of Gymnastics, it's a, a preschool C and, F um, I think it was really hard to, F um, to pick the right, F uh, day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out. I guess you can classify them all together. F Um, some of the qualifications that I look for was that, F uh, D you know, the cost, and, F um, exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, F um, F uh, in there, and, F um, D you know, F um, D you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was clean and F um, the hours C and, F um, just, just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff. F Oh, congratulations. Right. Or staying home. Uhhuh. That's a very good place to start I think. Uhhuh. Yeah, the Mother's Day Out programs, C and that's where Shannon had started, in a Mother's Day Out program C and, F uh, the churches always have I think, a, a pretty good program, C and you have to make sure that you, F um, that you apply pretty early, because they do have, a lot of places have very long waiting lists. C And, F um, C and another question to ask is if they're, F um, state certified F um, D you know, if the teachers have, F um, their Master's degree in, in child education and F um, child development. F Um, D you know, what, what kind of a structure is it going to be. F Um, when your child's a little bit older, like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap. Is there D like a mandatory nap time? What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going, C and if, C and they lay on these little mats, C and if they fall asleep, they kind of let them sleep, C and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones, C and the other ones get up and go do something else. C So, she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there D you know, which is, which is nice. F Um. That's true. Right. C And sometimes when the child's a lot younger, before they're really, F um, before three years old, D you know, D like the church is a good program C and sometimes you even consider, F um, D you know, having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that, C and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children because that makes, a, a, a difference, C and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day, just your child, and, or do they just put any child in any crib D you know, you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed D you know. I'm sure that, F um, whatever you decide, you'll be happy with. C And it's exciting time to have a new one <laughter>. I bet. That's, that's wonderful. Uhhuh. Asking. Right. Some, some places, F um, start them as early as, I think, D well, some, some places take them as infants, I guess, D you know, like eight weeks, even. F Um, there's a place to look into, F um, F um, a friend of mine who's a nurse is, was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in, on Fifteenth Street, up, it's in Plano somewhere where, F um, nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants, infants and then only up to like two years old C and it's, it's supposed to be really a, a, D you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones C and then other ones, F uh, are the older children. C But it is a difficult situation, I think. When they're, when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry, Hi, this is Laurie, C and I'm in Garland <laughter>. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, we don't have any children, C but we're going to have one next year <laughter>. Thanks. C So, F um, that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future. We haven't quite decided if I'm going to, I'm working part time now, C and I don't know if I'll be doing that or what we're going to do. C But if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody, C and our church has a Mother's Day Out program which they started last year, C and we know a lot of people at the church C so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh Uhhuh. Time, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. F Um, D you know, it's kind of scary, I guess, because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately, C and so, it's, I guess it's such a growing concern, C but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear. Right. To children. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. We're pretty excited. Yeah, C but that, D you know, we have been thinking about that, C but it's a little ways off in the future C but, F um, I figure, D you know, I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they, D you know, before you can bring them in. Uhhuh. F Um. Right. Uhhuh.
