D So, how do you feel about capital punishment? Right, you don't think, I, F uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. F Uh, it's, D you know, it seems right sometimes C and then other times, you don't know. F Uh, Right. Right. Uhhuh. C And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm, E I mean, sure, their life is taken, C but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway, C so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with C so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con, for the D you know, what they've done. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right, C but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway, C so F uh, it's, it doesn't, it seems by, that by, I don't know, doesn't ever really, p, F uh... Yeah. Right. It doesn't bring back every, What state are you in? F Oh, really? In Dallas? F Oh, really? F Uh, right now I'm in Utah, C but I'm from Plano, Texas. D So, F uh, F uh, what are the laws like in Texas? F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Wow. I haven't, no. C And they do it that way? Huh. Wow. I think they're there, I think that capital punishment is, is, F uh, in t, in Utah also. I'm not really familiar. Yeah, I am. C So, C but I think they d, a long time ago, A I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, F uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns C and one of them has the real gun in it. C So they don't know who killed, Right. Yeah, no. <Laughter>. I know. D Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, F uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. E I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, F uh, F uh, F uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties. Yet, on the other hand, F uh, I don't know, E I mean, there is things that <laughter> seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do. D Now, D you know, E I mean somebody, a s, s, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, D you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard, you kind of, I don't know. What about yourself? Uhhuh. E I mean, people, D like, I, it's been, E I mean, D like the Arab societies and stuff end up, F uh, having <throat_clearing> e, effective, effective punishments C and, C and they're extremely severe. F Uh, I, D you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, F uh, may be because y, you never know if it's going to be a, applied. Right, un, unlike, F uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand C and C and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand C and everybody knows exactly what, what for. F Uh, C and, D you know, C and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact, C or, C or there is a good chance you're going to get off. Uhhuh. Yeah, some people, Yeah. Except that, E I mean, the, the average cost <throat_clearing> to si, <lipsmack> to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. E I mean, A something, I, I was amazed at. F Uh, F uh, per year, it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. To keep people in jail. F Uh, D you know, C and it's sort of a <laughter>, sort of a crass perspective <laughter> on the usage of capital punishment, C but on the other hand, F uh, F uh, D you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, F uh... Uhhuh <<faint>>. F Oh, I know, E I mean, you can't, it doesn't, Taking, taking one more life doesn't, doesn't, doesn't re, get things back the way they were, right. Yeah, I don't know, I, I don't, I really don't know, F uh, I'm in Texas. W, w, No, I'm in Austin. Where, where are you calling from? F Oh, I see, uhhuh. It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s, D well, I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment. F Uh, Texas has had it for a while. It's one of the quickest, it, it, once it was, it was reallowed, I think it was outlawed for a while, but, F uh, by the supreme court, E I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution C and it seems like everybody stopped C and then, C and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, F uh, to actually, F uh, implement it again. They do it by, F uh, by, do it by lethal injection. F Uh, I'm originally from Kansas C and in Kansas also, F uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment C and, F uh, there they do it by hanging. Still, F uh, they have, I still remember the, the, the movie, F uh, IN COLD BLOOD. I don't know if you've ever, I'm sure you're familiar with it, C but, have you seen the movie? Yeah. That way. Yeah, D well, they, they show it, not, not, E I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixtytwo or something like that C and so it's, F uh, it's not particularly graphic, C but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, D you know, walk into the room with gallows. It's kind of a barn like structure. Is that right? Are you there in school? Yeah. Uhhuh, has, has a, yeah. Has a real bullets C and the rest of them have blanks? Yeah, I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner, I know that <laughter>. I've always said that if I, if I had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian. As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, I guess.
