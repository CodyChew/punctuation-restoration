D Well, Steve, did you go to college? F Oh, that's good. C So you probably could give some great advice. Uhhuh. D Well, what's your ca, what's your interest, your, F uh, Uhhuh. That, that's similar to what, I'm in a P H D program right now. C And, F uh, my area of expertise, it's information systems, which is a little bit less technical, I think, than, F uh, than computer science. C But my area of expertise is, F uh, F uh, human computer interaction. C And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, F uh, because it's of, I'm working with voice systems. Yeah. C So, C so, good luck. I guess we should talk about giving advice, though. Wh, what, what type of advice do you think you'd give to a, a parent? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change. I kn, I know very few people that, F uh, started in one field and stayed with it. D You know, they, I think that's what you just said, D you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, F uh, I think that's much more important. I, I think I'd, I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school, though, that has a number of different types of programs, D you know, that, F uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer, C but some of the, F uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, D you know, I guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things, C so if the kid does change, they don't have to transfer, C or they don't have to, F uh, F uh, I don't know, they don't have to give up years of, D you know, of credit transfer and things. Yeah. <Lipsmack> I normally, C and, C and parents hate to hear this, D you know, C because I, I actually teach college, I hate to, F uh, I hate to talk to the parents because, F um <lipsmack> one of the reasons is because, D you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want, C and I always say make sure you major, in something that you like, even if it's not going to be your career vocation, because you'll get better grades. I, I think most employers would probably rather hire, D you know, a, a three six in, F um, <lipsmack> in history, F uh, to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration. Does that make sense? Yeah. I always, D you know, tell them that you should major in something you, you're going to get good grades in. Because that, that's always, I think, more important, D you know, overall. I don't know. Yeah. F Oh, you, you're at the office now? At work? Yeah. I would, I would, it would, I, I tell you, I live in Maryland, C and the public schools here are, pretty good. I teach at a public school, actually, C and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch, a lot of the private schools. C And, F um, I actually, I would full time at a, at a public school, C and then right now I'm teaching part time at a private school, at a <noise> Catholic institution. C And, F um <lipsmack>, C and I really think, I think I'm getting a better <noise> caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, C and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are public, are, are college educated, C and I don't, I think because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, D you know, they're not, th, it, it's the minimal cost. C But <beep> I think you can get a good education at public or private <beep> C but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, D you know, I you have to really, you have to look around at the school. I, I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah, does it have a big ten football team C or, Yeah. E I mean, F uh, yeah, is it a PAC ten school, D you know. C But I think, yeah, D see, I'm, I'm at the University of Maryland, C so in this, this region, F um, though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland, my diploma will still say University of Maryland. F Um, <lipsmack> D you know, it doesn't, doesn't differentiate on my diploma, though I would put it on my resume, what program I went to. C But I, I think, D you know, I'm actually at a smaller program, I'm not at the col, the big College Park campus, D you know, that's the big one with the football team. C So I, I think, F um, I think you're right, that there's a lot of, there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition. F Um, <lipsmack> D you know, when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, D you know, in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast as, as, D you know, one step below M I T in a sense, D you know, C so it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school, C and technical people know that. C But I don, yeah, I think you're right, you really have to think about that for the job. I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's, C and when I, D now, I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs, I was going to be a teacher, I was just a high school teacher, C so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of, D you know, C but then when I went, F um, <lipsmack> for graduate work, D you know, or for a new job, people said to me, D you know, Shippensburg State, where is that, D you know <laughter>. C And, D you know, when I went into higher education, even at other universities, they weren't aware of it, D you know. C So I think yeah, that's important, F um, <lipsmack>. I think it depends on if you want to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job, you need that first, job or so out of school, too. Uhhuh, yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, depending on your technical areas. Yeah, I could see that. C But, D you know, at some of the large schools, I know that at, at, at University of Maryland where I am, D you know, in a P H D program, I, I haven't even met, F uh, someone outside of my area of information systems except for, Yeah. In fact, I'm still going. F Uh, D well, I don't know about that, <breathing> C but I, in fact, I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school. <Breathing>. F Uh, D well, computer science and cognitive science. C So, F Oh, I see. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. To a parent? D Well, D you know, the thing is, when you're a kid and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think they know what they want. C An, C and, E I mean, choosing from my experience, D you know, I thought, D you know, my, I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want. C But, F uh, I don't know, at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school, D you know, the size of it or, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's disruptive. <Breathing>. <Talking>. <Talking>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. D Well, yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. F Uh, <<muffled>> give me five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just getting ready to go to lunch <breathing>. F Uh, yeah, that's like what we were saying, though, would you, F uh, advise a private school, or a public school, D you know, what's the trade off there, what, <Talking>. F Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think, F uh, I would agree with that. In fact, the thing that, I'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, I was trying to choose. D You know, a particular institution might be better for my area yet, D like, D say, D you know, the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area. Yet, if I go to U of I or C M U or, D you know, some, D you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better, C but it's the same thing, there's, D you know, what will the name recognition, get me, kind of thing. Yeah, <laughter> yeah <breathing>. That's <breathing> that's usually the basic criteria. Yeah. F Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, <breathing> yeah <breathing>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I guess another thing that concerns me is, F uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that job market <<speaker talking to someone else in room>> C and, F uh, F um, where was I at? F Oh, go, in going to school, you get taught the things you learn in school, C but there is also a whole other dimension, E I mean the growing up while you're going to school part. C And, F uh, actually, in the Midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like University of Missouri, will have a main campus like Columbia, which is big, multi disciplinary, C and they'll have a satellite campus in a, usually in a smaller town <breathing> that specializes in the technical field. C So you've really, F uh, I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything. Yeah.
