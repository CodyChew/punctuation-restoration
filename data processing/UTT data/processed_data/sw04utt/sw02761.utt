Okay, what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful <laughter>. D Well I guess so. Have you had any in the la, ha, D well how old are you? Okay C so you ha, you have been to some family reunions, perhaps. D Now how long in advance do they, F uh, let them know? Uhhuh. C So they all know it. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes. D Well that sounds like fun, do they all have the small children too, that come? C So all ages. D Well my husband has, F uh, on one side has an extended family, C and they don't ever plan it li, as, like you do. I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind C so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody, because they're rather socially active too. C And so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there. If they don't, D you know, they'll say, F oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else C and we're already locked in C but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them. My family, F uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families. Therefore, they don't have many people left. C And, F uh, the few previous ones I've had, F uh, I haven't known many of those people, C but, F uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family C and that's been very nice, with, F uh, I have one sister, and three brothers C and they're only three out of five of us who have children. C So, F uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other. C And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large, C and they don't see each other very often, we don't really know many of them. It really is, they're fun, they're a lot of fun, C but, F uh, still, F uh, they're not done on a regular basis C and, F uh, you kind of forget what happened, <laughter> and who they were from the time before. F Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas? C Or you go to Indiana on that? Uhhuh, where in Indiana? Lafayette, I don't know where, I used to live in Indianapolis. Yeah, yeah, it's very pretty country in there I think, it's gorgeous. D Well I, F uh, when is your next one, F uh, scheduled now. Yes, D well, C and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you <laughter>. Maybe <laughter>. E I mean you need another milestone, D you know. Yes, D well I'm sure, C and ha, then all of your family probably has not met your husband. F Oh, is he? C And, C and he's living, your both living in Sherman. Do you work to T I? Uhhuh, C and does he? Uhhuh, D well, we don't either, C but, F uh, I have a friend who, F uh, is working on this project. Yes, C and, D Well, I don't know, F uh, I, I have a hard time getting, F uh, people on the telephone. D Uhhuh, getting through to anybody. Sometimes I call off and on all day, C but anyway, F uh, I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we <laughter>. C But I got off that. Yes, D well, F um, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes. C And, F uh, F uh, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure. <Laughter> C But it has been fun talking to you. Thank you. Okay, good. Byebye. <Laughter> Have a big family, I guess, that's a start. <Laughter>. Twentyfive, C so, I just got married. Right, every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, F uh, D like my p, grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids. D Well, we plan on it, it's D like the third weekend in August, C so it's every four years C and so, Yeah C and then, D you know, arrangements are made D like during the Summer for D you know, F um, food and whose, whose staying where, because a lot of people fro, are from down here, in Texas. C And, F uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana. That's where I'm originally from. C So, F um, we usually meet D like at my uncle's cottage in the, F um, at the lake and, F uh, make a couple days of it. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah C and, F uh, <throat_clearing> D you know, there's some my age C and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <breathing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's kind of bad. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family. A lot of my cousins are real close C and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that, C so. F Uh, no, the ones in Indiana, uhhuh. Lafayette. Yeah, it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour. Uhhuh, C so. <Laughter> D Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when I graduated from college, C so I guess about two more years. <Laughter> F Uh, maybe, I don't know, two more years, I don't know, probably. Yeah, I guess that's, that's what, E I mean I've been married now for about nine months C so that was another milestone, I guess <throat_clearing>. F Um, yeah, he's from Indiana, C so they all met, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. No, he's trying to get in med school, C so. F Oh, really. Are they getting all the data they need? F Oh really. F Huh. <Laughter>. <Laughter> D Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess. F Oh, okay. F Oh yeah. D Well you too. C And maybe I'll talk to you again. Okay, byebye.
