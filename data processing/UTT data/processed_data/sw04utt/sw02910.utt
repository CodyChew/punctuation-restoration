D Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion. I, I, I'm from New York originally C and now that I live in Florida, I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime C and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper <laughter>, although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES. I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger, C and I try t, now that it has a national edition, I read that. I also read, F uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, F uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage, C and, C and I guess I'm, Yeah. D Well, there , it's a whole hour show. D Actually, it's an hour show each evening, C and, C and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner. We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up. I find that I'm leaning on, F uh, I travel a great deal, F uh, even overseas, C and I find that I lean on, F uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff. C And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out. E I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say, C but it's, it's coverage, D you know. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh. D Well, yeah, I, I, I, F uh, Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, F uh, Iraq. I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him. I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw C and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, D you know. Yeah , F oh, yeah, E I mean, F uh. No. That, that's right, I think so. C And, C and I guess when it comes to, F um, to magazines, I don't read, I used to when I was younger, I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper C or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, ex, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS, which sort of gives you a different slant, than, it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper. C But, F uh, that I guess, and the radio. F Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot C and I also listen to, F uh, these twentyfour hour news stations, when I'm driving. I, Yeah. Do you read, are you from Southern or Northern California? D So D well, Yeah, is that, what is that, the San Francisco paper out there is, F uh, the major paper? Yeah, C and that's a terrible paper. <Cough>. Is that pretty good? F Oh the, what is that, the CHRONICLE isn't it? Oh. F Oh yeah, they ju, they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read. I, F uh, F uh, Yeah. D Well, can you get the L A paper up there? That's a pretty decent paper isn't it C or, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well that's another one I read, I forgot that. I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL, not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer C but, Yeah. I, I think I, I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff. I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that, I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today. If anything, they, I think they list, D Well, I don't know, I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and listen, and taking their word for it, C or their comment, D actually, they, I think they slant things C but, <Laughter>. No kidding! F Oh, wow! I didn't know that. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, was, was he, Yeah. How do you feel about it? I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to, I don't know if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped. Yeah. To, Yeah. Yeah, I think I do too. I think you have to let, yo, you got to segregate some of it. D Well, that's about all I have to say <laughter>. Nice talking to you. Byebye. I think I get most of my news, F uh, in headlines from the radio, C and then I followup by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. I like them C but they take so long. I don't always have time <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think C N N does a pretty good job. I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War. C And they seemed to have the best coverage. They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, F uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted, C but I think they said that frequently enough. That, F uh, you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, we have a C B S twentyfour hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work C and, Northern. I'm from, F uh, the peninsula, Palo Alto. D Well, it's horrible. The San Francisco paper is just wretched. C So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS. Palo Alto is about midway between. D Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper C and, Yeah, there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER, C but they're, F uh, both run by the same peo, They're just horrid C so we read, F Uh, we can, C but I don't like it. C So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and F uh, MERCURY NEWS. Yes, D well again, I read that, F uh, two columns on the front. Uhhuh. Yes C and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, F uh, the news coverage. We almost have too much. D Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather. I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston. C And I hated him then. C And I would not watch that man for money. C And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach. C So I watch Peter Jennings, and, F uh and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately. Do we get enough news or something like that? Do we get, F uh do we get the news that we want? C And I do. I really think. Yeah. Okay, D well nice to talk to you. Byebye.
