Now we're ready. Do you have a personal computer? You do, in your home? I do not have one in my home. I use one all day at work, C but I don't have one at home. Do you find you use it a lot? Uhhuh, uhhuh. What kind do you have? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds interesting. I have a, a P S one I B M type. F Uh, C and I use it all day at work C and I put all my personal stuff on it at work <laughter>. C So I really don't, haven't had a need for one at home C but probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work, I'd want one at home. Uhhuh. Yeah. What is that tracing, tracking the flights and things? F Uh. They tell us when we're through. They come in and tell us. Have you just started doing this? F Oh really? They'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now C and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that. It's not more than five min, <clicking>, C But, I'm going to ignore that. That's a call on my other line, C so I'm just going to ignore it. C But, <Laughter> It's kind of a hassle when you have this, C but other times <clicking> it. I work at Texas Instruments. Yes. I sure do. D Well, no, I'm doing this at home. I'm already home for the day. I <clicking> do it, D you know, I can't do it at work. I, I'm, I work in the legal department C so I'm pretty busy. C But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents. We use Word Perfect, Lotus. F Uh, Yeah, it's really, I love Lotus. I think that's about my favorite. Uhhuh. It really is, C and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it. C But, F uh, D you know, you learn something every time you use it. Uhhuh. You can, did they give you a number to call? You can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you C but you can only make one call a day. Yeah, if you've talked to someone, like you're talking to me now and I place the call, this counts as your call. C So you cannot make a call now until tomorrow. No, we both do. Didn't they ask you for your I D number when you answered? Okay C so you both do. From what I understand. It's for research. It's a research type project on F uh, voice activated electronics, D you know. To, F uh, it's, F uh D well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this. D Now I don't know, I don't know everything about it C but they, F uh, try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this C and that way they can check voice patterns. Uhhuh, C and get the computer where it recognizes voices. D Well, I probably do because I've, <Laughter>. D Well, I've been b, I was born and raised in Texas. Have lived here forever C so I probably do. I'm in Richardson. It's right outside of Dallas. Uhhuh. D Well, Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano. You probably did. Uhhuh. D Well, what are you doing way in Washington? Uhhuh. D Well, that's interesting. Uhhuh. C So I imagine they use personal computers. Do they do their correspondence on it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. We have one. Yes, yes, ma'am. Do you wish you, I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do. My, actually my husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called micro, micro computers one o one C and we're just touching on data base, spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of, D you know, different kinds of <noise> storage C and we're just kind of touching on a basic computer. We have an I B M compatible. It's a Gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs. Yeah. What kind of a computer do you use at work? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. I worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years. Which was different <laughter>. C But I didn't, Right, right. How long are we supposed to talk on this? F Oh, okay, okay. This is, This is my very first time. Yes. F Oh, okay. Uhoh. F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. That, I have that, too. W, where do you work? F Oh, you do? F Oh, D well, of course. Of course. That's why you <laughter>, why you're making these calls, right? F Oh, I see. D Well, this is a pretty good deal. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, you do know Lotus, F huh? F Oh, that's great. That's something we want to learn. F Oh. I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it. That's great. Uhhuh. I have a question. On this, this thing that I'm, this survey or whatever, D you know, this I volunteered for. Do I start calling in myself C or do I wait for people to call me? Right, C and eight hundred number. F Oh, only one a day. Right. F Oh, F Oh, I see. Okay, C so then, do you get the five bucks C or do I? F Oh, we both do. D Well that's a, Right, I had to put that in. D Well, that's a pretty good deal. D So why, why are we doing this? Actually, I'm doing this for somebody else C but, D you know, for a friend of mine. Uhhuh. Oh. It's almost like that, Like a voice command computer type thing, F oh. D Well, that's wonderful. I see, different kinds of voices and things. Wonderful. See that's why I, it's interesting because you have I, I'm going to say you have an accent <laughter>. C And I, C and I think that I don't. E I mean to you C but, D you know. C And you're in what city? Okay, my sister, one of my sisters lives in Plano. C And that's right outside of, How about that. I probably went through Richardson, then. C And then I have a sister that lives in Austin. C But, D Well, we're actually all from Nebraska. They just are recently moved there. My brotherinlaw is director of Admissions at the University of Texas in Dallas. Yeah, C and then my sister works at the Air Force Base. Actually, yes, they both have personal computers. F Uh, I think they just send Christmas letters on it. As far as I, mostly my one sister uses hers for her children. D You know, children's games.
