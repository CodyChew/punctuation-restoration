Okay, D well what do you do on your yard? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Comes back in the yard C so you don't have any one do your yard. You do it yourself? Yeah, we do too. <Laughter> Isn't that the truth. A flyer's on every door every day. <Laughter> That's right. D Well, we, F um, we, my husband does the same thing, he does the yard, C and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower, C but I keep putting off learning. That's right. C But I had recently gone out and planted mums. We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago, C and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's and put out yellow and bronze C and they're just gorgeous, C and so then last week my mom comes in town, C and she says D Well, those are going to die just the first frost. She said, You should have done pansies. C And I went, D Well, now you tell me. C So the first night, that around Halloween C and we went out and covered them with a sheet, C and they did okay that first night. C But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it, C so I guess I've lost them. I haven't gone out to check yet. No, listen, C but, F um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here. I guess it was about four years ago. C And we did not know in August to put down the, F uh, whatever it is for grub worms. C And the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up. Have you ever seen it what grub worms do? C And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it, it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt. C So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything. It took a lot of money and a lot of time, C so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon. F Oh, yeah, we found them yeah we found them. We dug under there about an inch C and you could see them. They're real fat little white things, C and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring yeah, C but in, C but in the, Uhhuh. Yeah, June bugs is what I'd heard them called, C so D any how, occasionally I find them in the flower beds. They said that every yard has some C but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem. C So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before. F Oh, yeah that too, two years ago, or last Christmas is that what you're talking about? Yeah, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I guess you did too. It's what they've done in the spring or the fall. Yeah, because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it. Yeah. Yeah keep it damp. D Well, my, out here, D you know, we don't have as many trees in Plano, at least the area where, we're over by Collin Creek Mall, C and, C but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died, C and all those variegated, F uh, things died. C So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly, C and they just live, Yeah, you can, you can stand those. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well it's kind of like one of these, Same way, uhhuh. That, they, they warned me of that one finally. C And I said, D You know, you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there, C and we didn't know the difference. C And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these <laughter> mums. Okay, next year, I'll do pansies. C And my backyard, we had it really nice, C and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy, C and so, it was about, I guess he's three now, C so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door <laughter> and laid them on the patio. C So, it's like our backyard is just kind of like, as long as he won't damage it, fine, C and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more. Uhhuh. Very much, C but, F uh. You did. F Huh. Uhhuh. So do ours, yeah. What did you grow? That is amazing. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, put them in a salad, though, C and you say, D well, I made it though, at least it's mine. D Well, F uh, typical lawn stuff. Saint Augustine, F uh with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas F uh, C and really all I do to it is, F uh, in fact, I didn't even fertilize it this year, I just mowed it, C and I, I mow it, F uh, D you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down Yeah. I do it myself. Have a lot of people trying to do it for me <laughter>. Hey, I need the exercise, C so what the heck. Hey, you've got the right idea. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to look at them. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you, you think that's what it was, F huh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, those kind of brown, F uh, Ju, What we call June bugs C and some people call them May beetles. <Laughter>. F Uh, yeah. Yeah, D well, I had some of that problem, C but mine was freeze. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm still I'm still replacing that in the back, especially, under the trees F uh, D you know, kind of slow, and, as you say, very expensive. I caught Wolfe with, F uh, F uh, one, F uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents, C and, F uh I bought about <laughter> twenty of them. F Uh, D well, I put, D you know that was late, that was like, Yeah, that was like September, I think. C And I had to water it, D you know gosh. Yeah, they're pretty tough, F uh, Pittosporum is kind of borderline here C and usually it'll do pretty well, C but, F uh, D you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals C and it zaps it. F Oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way. Yeah. Your list is growing, F Oh, yeah, F oh, gee. F Um. Yeah, kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds, yeah. I had a, had a small vegetable garden that, F uh, It did pretty well, it's, it's D like on the side, the apron of the, of the parkway out behind the garage C and, F uh, our, our garages come in from the back, D you know, from the alley C and, F uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there <laughter>. D Well, I had, F uh, tomatoes and, and, F uh, F uh, peppers, C and I had, I had okra, C and by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, F uh they kind of came out looking like gourds. C But I had squash, I had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,
