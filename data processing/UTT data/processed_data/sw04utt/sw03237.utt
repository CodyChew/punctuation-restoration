Okay, C so you said that you live in Coppell. C So what is your house like? F Oh, D well that's neat, Uhhuh is it one you're renting or buying? Yeah, yeah, D well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex, you can still buy. That's good. Do you have any children? Yes, I have two children, C and our home is really too small for us right now <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, we moved from an apartment that was really small, C and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old C so we moved into this house in Garland, it's in one of the older areas of town C and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere D you know, lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty, C but the, the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet yeah, it's real little. Yeah, C and now I have a daughter, now my, the one that was five months old is seven years old C and the one, I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes, and <laughter> toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put, D Well, they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room, D you know C but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet C so, F um, the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom C but we have always just put D like our computer and extra toys and books and D you know, it's kind of a catch all room <laughter>. C But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff, C so. Yeah, that works out good. C And I'm thankful I have two girls, because they're in bunk beds, C and so, D you know, they can share a room and, F uh, make for more space that way. She's three and a half yeah, C so, F um, C and right now we have their clothes on, F uh, D like double racks, D you know, in the closet we made a higher and a lower C and it works out fine, C but they're just about to get too tall <laughter>, where the dresses are beginning to drag D you know, C and, F um, we're going to have to figure out a new idea. C But we're, we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home F uh, hoping to be able to do that within a year or so C so that would be nice. Yeah, is Coppell a nice area to live? D Well, I think I've heard a lot, F uh, about Coppell schools, that they're real good that's neat. Do you, do you hope to have children, C or are you not planning on having any, C or, I see. D Well, do you have any pets? F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, do they stay inside, C or, D Well, that's, that's neat. Yeah. D Well, what are the colors in your house? F Oh, I bet that's pretty. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's neat. I like cows, too. Yeah D well, our house was redo, F uh, our house is very old also it's like thirtyseven years old yeah, C and it was redone before we moved in, which, I'm thankful for that, C but the, it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in everything is D like, the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has, F um, paneling in the living room, and lots of, lots of tans and lots of browns C but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that D you know, C so, F uh, that's worked out good. In the, in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan, F um, wallpaper had done it up with blues, C so that's nice, C but yeah, yeah, we've enjoyed living here. It's close to my, F uh, oldest daughter's school C and that makes it really handy, too C and she really likes her school, C so C and we are so close to shopping C and... Yeah, how about in Coppell? I've always imagined it kind of out, away from everything. F Oh, really, F Oh, D well, that's nice. F Oh, wow, Oh. Yeah, yeah C but it does sound like it's definitely growing. Yeah. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. D Well, when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock C and we almost moved to Lewisville, that was our second choice, D yeah, behind Garland, we, at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home, Uhhuh. It's a two bedroom, two baths duplex. Brick and, F uh, No, we own it, yeah, D well, our side <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah. No, huhuh. Do you? <Laughter> Ours is, too. We outgrew it when we moved in. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. F Oh, wow. <Laughter> You all are cramped <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh, how many bedrooms is it? Uhhuh Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> How fun. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And how old's the youngest? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we'd like to do. F Oh, it's a wonderful place to live, C and they, I don't have any kids, C so I don't really know, C but they say that we have wonderful schools. Uhhuh. F Um. I don't think so, no. <Laughter>. F Oh, of course, those are my kids I have two dogs. <Laughter>. Yeah, they're inside dogs. They're my babies. <Laughter>. F Uh, F um, kind of a mauve and gray. Uhhuh, C and then the kitchen's kind of a, a country pink and country blue, C and it's all done in cows, I'm a cow nut <laughter>. Uhhuh D so. Uhhuh. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, yeah, Uhhuh. F Oh, sounds pretty. <Laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Good. <Laughter> That's an important factor there <laughter>. D Well, D you know, now we have that new mall in Lewisville C and that's just D like a mile or two from our house C but, when we first moved to Coppell, A it's what, six years ago, we didn't even have a grocery store C and now we have four <laughter> C and Coppell's not really big enough to support fo, four grocery stores D so, F Oh, much very much. In fact, it's about the size now, I moved down here from Chicago, what, twentythree years ago and, to Lewisville C and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when, when I moved down here. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh really,
