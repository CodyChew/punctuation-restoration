. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I'm kind of into it. I'm, F uh, kind of a sailor. I'm up in Minneapolis now, C but I was in Florida <thumping>, C so, F uh, <sniffing> yeah, I was kind of into it for a while there. Yeah, for the most part. Yeah I had a little sail, No <laughter>. What part of Texas you from? Okay, whereabouts is that? Okay, all right. Is that right? Wow, that's pretty wild. Okay, C so you got some lakes around you can do that on. You do skiing and stuff C or, Yeah? All right. Yeah? All right. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, we've, F uh, our, the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. Yeah. <Laughter>. Not, not, not too many, no. C But, F uh, no, I just got back from a weekend. We went and, F uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. It was pretty nice, C but, F uh, D no, I, I have, F uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff. That's a lot of fun, C but, F uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too, they're kind of into it. F Oh, yeah, I guess it's pretty, F uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, F huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right. C So, where about in Texas is that? Is that centrally located C or, F Uh, no, what, what major city is nearby? Okay, C and that's south or <thumping> north of there or something? Yeah? Okay. F Oh, <thumping> okay, all right. D Well, that sounds pretty good. Does, F uh, I guess the weather, does that stay pretty constant there C or, Yeah? Okay, D well, that's pretty temperate. Yeah, that's not too bad. C But, F uh, <sniffing> yeah, have you done, F uh, any other boating then C or, Yeah? F Oh, that's great. Yeah, I, F Oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I used to, F uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, F uh, north western Florida in the panhandle, I used to sail about every day. I'd work, go to work, Yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's, F uh, especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat D like those catamarans are pretty fast. You can actually, D Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. F Uh, my family's pretty into it C and, F uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six C and then, F uh <sniffing>, Yeah, it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, D you know, F uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it. C So it's, it's not too bad, it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think C and, F uh, <thumping> generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it, C but some people are more motorboaters, D you know which is fine. Yeah, yeah, lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing, C but, then, again, they may nev, m, they may never have tried anything like, F uh, catamaran C and, F uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. D You know, you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers, they get so fast, D you know. Yeah, they get pretty quick, C but F uh, Yeah, yeah, I haven't, I haven't personally done that, C but, F uh, the races, I, I work with a guy right now that, F uh, <sniffing> races catamarans in the summertime C and, F uh, he's pretty gassed about it. He's got a good, F uh, D Well, he, F uh, he's from Detroit C so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. F Uh, for me, I, I go back to Orlando, F uh, <thumping> in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast. We're about <thumping> thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast, C and there's a lot of places there you can go, D you know. C So, F uh, C so that's a good thing. C But, D yeah, C so, what do you do for a job? F Oh, really? Okay, is that for T I C or, Okay. Are they primarily electronic, then? Okay. D Well that, Right. F Oh, okay. Great. Yeah, how do you like it down there in Texas? Yeah? F Oh, no doubt. Okay. I've never been to Texas. I've been to Oklahoma, C but, F uh, that's about as far as, Yeah? Okay, D well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well <laughter>. D Well, we have, we used to, when I was younger we'd go every weekend. C But we haven't done m, l, whole lot of it lately. Yeah. Were you sailboating? Yeah. D Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here <laughter>. Just motorboat's all we, F Uh, Nacogdoches. That's between Houston and Dallas. It's the oldest town in Texas. Yeah. We have, F uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches, C so we do a lot of boating on. Yeah. Yeah, little bit. Just got through snow skiing <laughter>. Yeah. Just came back from Denver C but, Yeah, it, it, it was heavy when we were there though. I didn't see any boats there, though. <Laughter>. Yeah? F Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats. Uhhuh. Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here. It's, F uh, D well, you ever heard of Lufkin? Houston. Let me see, Houston's north. Dallas is south. It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons. Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon. No, I hadn't done any in a l, F uh, lately, C but that's all, I used to ha, F uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop. C And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about. C And we had a n, different boat every day. I'd like to do some sailing. Yeah, what, Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that C or they just, Yeah. Is it pretty easy? Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that's about all we have <laughter>. Uhhuh. I didn't know that. That that would be something. Uhhuh. What kind of, what lake do you all use? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, I build transformers. Yeah. No, it's for Cooper Industries. Yeah. D Well they have a, D you know, worldwide, C but w, all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. It's real nice. Been here all my life. Yeah. F Oh, it's, n, Oklahoma's nothing like it. <Laughter>.
