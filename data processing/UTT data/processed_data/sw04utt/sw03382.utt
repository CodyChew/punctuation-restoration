F Uh, I guess, F uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff. I've, read a lot of the, the, F uh, astronomy books and, and stuff like that. F Uh, F Uh, to a degree. I haven't kept up as, F uh, much as I would like, I've just been so busy, F uh, I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then, C so. Yeah. D Well, I wouldn't even mind, F uh, being a pilot on one, C or right now C but I'm probably getting a little too old for that. Right. Yeah. D Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps. I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, F uh, F uh, equipment and stuff that, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher, D you know, he's one of the comedians C and C and, D you know, he, he talks a lot on, on Velcro. Wh, i, what would we do without it? <laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up. I know maybe some of the big things that, F uh, F uh, concentrated foods for one maybe <laughter> I don, F Uh, I don't know it's also just I've, I've often pictured, F uh, in my mind, D you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going? F Uh, I guess our minds are so, F uh, F uh, A what is it? F Uh, finite when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, C and it's hard to, to see, D you know. I always thought D well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually. It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely. Yeah. C But, Yeah. I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something. C And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, D you know, Yeah. F Huh. I think that's what made us, F uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity. There must be some better so, better way of doing this. A better place to be or whatever, D you know it's, C So you, you are always looking for something better. I know at work, F uh, people always complain to me I, D well, you are always whining C and, it's, I'm always looking for something better. F Uh, There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it. Yeah. D Well, they are always finding easier ways C and, D you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that. C And they are doing it un, D you know, unconsciously. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Have you been following the, F uh, the progress of the space health code? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I think it's pretty exciting that they can, F uh, it would be interesting to see if they can find, F uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, F uh, D you know, F uh, humans C and, F uh, yeah, I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, F uh, if it, D you know, if it is at all possible. <Laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, F uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, F uh, abilities may not be, F uh, a barrier anymore. Yeah, I agree. F Uh, as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, D you know, to visit the, F uh, space center out there, C and, F uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro C and, F uh, that vacuum, F uh, little space program was one of the big, D you know, backers of that. It's amazing, D you know, you, it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, yeah, I've h, seen him before. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yo, we were talking about that just the other day. What did we do without it back then? I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's right. That's right. Uhhuh. That's true. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, that, that is, F uh, that is something that would be hard to think about. I agree. You know like you say we're used to finite things C and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible. C But, F uh, yeah, I would like to see them, F uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, F uh, something that the ordinary person can, F uh, en, enjoy. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I wouldn't even mind being <laughter> not so much being first but just, F uh, get out there and, and just explore. I think, F uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, D you know, indifferent. F Oh, sure. Sure. Of course. That's true. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. That's right. That's right. C And if you are just content with being, D you know, with the way things are then, D you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life. <Laughter> Because if yo, Uhhuh. Yeah, I guess, F uh, you don't really think about it too much. I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff C but yo, it, it's in a subconscious, D you know, thing. D You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, D you know, things that you've improved upon, you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list. C But you just don't think about them. <Lipsmack> C And that's true. I think, F uh, D you know, we've gotten different programs at work, D you know, to, to, F uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,
