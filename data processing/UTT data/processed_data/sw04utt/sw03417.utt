Yes. F Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite, our total tax burden, despite tax cuts C but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in, in the world, C and in of the matter, you get what you pay for, if we're going to have national health insurance, which seems likely, it's necessarily going to involve more taxes. F Uh, I suspect, I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the, the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, F uh, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes, that's the direction we should look. Where's it all going? D Well, one, one, one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into, into a big trust fund, C but that is a particularly regressive tax, F uh, it's a tax on the first dollar earnings, C and Senator Moynihan's, F uh, proposal to, to, to cut there I think wou, makes a lot of sense. I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to, to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to, going to beef up, up, up the social security program could make a lot of sense. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. I think Japan, I think Japan is probably about equal to ours C and other major countries are higher. Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes, the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago. C And, as a whole, most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services, C and it's a real, real, they're, they're real tradeoffs there. F Uh, <laughter> I, that's, that's a scary thing that there's no, no real knowing about. F Uh, the, the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans. No, I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. F Uh, part of the Commerce Department. Here in Gaithersburg, Maryland. D Well, D well I, I, I didn't pick it, F uh E I mean, F um, I, D like I don't really recall. I may have filled out on the, on the form, C but I, I certainly, certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before. Yes, yes, when you place a call topic is given to you. F Oh, you should try it. F Uh, many of the subjects are. F Uh, taxes, taxes especially. F Um, one thing that has kept our tax burden high, A and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the, is the level of def, of the defense budget C and that's, that same subject, Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings <laughter>. F Um, D you know, you always sit there C and out of each pay check so much comes out of it, C and you wonder, D you know, where's it all going C and we have such a huge, F uh, national deficit, C and, C and I guess a lot of times there's questions wondering D well, if it's doing a whole lot of good. I know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help. C But you kind of always wonder, D well where's, where's the money going? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. I'm sorry, I couldn't. Right, right. Yeah, I agree with that. As far as other countries, I'm not, F um, I don't keep up on it too much as to far <laughter> as what, D you know, as what they're do,. I know we were in Ireland last year C and I know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here, C but C but as far as other countries, I'm not, F uh, up to par on <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah, C but, C and, C and you sit there and wonder, F um, I guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general, and, and, F um, wondering if you're going to have enough when you retire <laughter> to live on. Uhhuh, yeah, that's true. C But, F um, are you involved with the legislature up there, C or which, Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. I was just wondering since you said Washington D C, C and you, C and you picked this topic, I was just <laughter> kind of curious. F Oh, you didn't. F Oh, did you. D See, I haven't placed any calls. Did they automatically assign the topic? F Oh, I didn't know that. I thought whoever made the call could choose what topic, C because I haven't made any calls yet. I've just received some. F Oh, I didn't realize that <laughter>. Okay. Yeah, C because it's kind of a, it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to. Exactly.
