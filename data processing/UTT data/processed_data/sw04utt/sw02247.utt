Okay, F um, D now the term personal computer, F uh, I don't happen to have one at home. F Um, C but I do have a personal computer on my desk here. Yeah, F uh, yeah, just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, F uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process. C And, F uh, it, it works just fine. It says it's a monochrome monitor, Panasonic printer, F uh, no big deal, it, it does the things I need for it to do. No, it's not even that. F Uh, I think that's about where it is. F Uh, yeah, I do that, I, I do, F uh, some Lotus on it. F Uh, do some, F uh, Samna, some, F uh, P F M, F uh, nothing extremely complex. Uhhuh. Yep. F Oh, yeah. I bet that's a pretty nice setup. Yep. Wow. Yep. Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Right. D Well, F um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M, C and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect. C So, I can never quite stay current with that. Uhhuh. Oh. F Huh. I can bel, I can believe that. No, not really. I'm not that up be on that sort of thing. F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. Okay. F Oh, D well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers. I can believe that. D Well, it's, it's been interesting. Yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing. I wo, is, is that the newest thing now, the four eightysix? That, that must be a fairly recent release. Okay, okay. C Because I, I had done capital packages for two eightysixes and three eightysixes, C but I didn't know they had a four eightysix just yet. Uhhuh. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I did too, C and you have a good day. Byebye. A type of work station? Is it a two eightysix or three eightysix base machine? It's eighty eightyeight? Okay. F Uh <<pause>>, what type of, F uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously. Okay. F Uh, I use them both here at work and at home. C And I have I B M clones in both cases. Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eightysix base mach, machine. Yes, it is. F Uh, unfortunately I need all of it. F Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size. C And that, I know that, F uh, brings an eighty eightyeight machine to it's knees because <laughter>, I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it C and he had a two eightysix machine, C and it brought it to it's knees. Just in the ability to handle. C And then I have, F uh, a three eightysix F X a sixteen bit machine, at home. C And I'm really pleased with it. It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, F uh, databases, database searches. F Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. Have you, To try to make them more effective and useful. Have you been, F uh, struggling along those lines? D Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, F uh, I used it on, F uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it. The, at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from. Very frustrating. F Uh, C but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. F Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. You come here with the B level of specs? D Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. F Uh, to one level down from assistant description. D Well, I sure need them. F Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them. Yes, F uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. When you start seeing what all they can do for you. D Well, I understand that <laughter>, D you know. if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eightysix machine at home <laughter>. Right. F Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year. It does a few more things, F uh, than had been available before. C But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. F Uh, D you know, once you get passed thirtythree megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway. D Well, okay. I enjoyed our discussion. You do the same. Bye.
