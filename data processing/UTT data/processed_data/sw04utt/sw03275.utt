F Um, I do <laughter>. What, what do you think about them? Yeah, definitely. I have one right now C and, F um, I just got it about eight, six months ago C and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, my goodness. Really? That's good. D, yeah, I, I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I couldn't pay it in full every month that I'd have to rip it up, C so. <Laughter>. That's, Yeah, C but, Uhhuh. I have, I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out <laughter>. C And they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off. C And, C and, C and D like one of my friends she has, hers is up to nine hundred dollars C and she do, she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school. C And, C and so E I mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like <laughter> thirtyfive dollars worth of food a month. D So and, and pay for her D like, D like monthly fee D like twen, yo, I guess you have to pay D like twenty dollars each month is the C so all she's paying is interest on hers every month. It just seems crazy to, to me C but, Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? Was a Visa card? <Gasp> F Oh, my goodness. <Laughter> I bet. Yeah, I, I don't know. I'm about sick of mine right now. I don't, Uhhuh. Right. Exactly. Yeah, my parents are really good about not using credit cards. They are against it <laughter>. I don't think they like the fact that I have one either. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> F Huh. Yeah, I'm nine, I'm twenty right now. C So, just going to school and, <breathing> <groan> and working C so it does kind of get in the, when you want something that, D like last weekend was homecoming C and I needed a pair of shoes C so I just went out and bought them and <laughter> on my credit card. I didn't really have the money to do it C but, Yeah <<very faint>>. It sure is. C So do you just have two kids C or, F Oh, really? Neat. I'm from Plano, Texas. C But right now I'm out in Provo, Utah going to B Y U C so <lipsmack>. Yep <laughter>. C But, this is a extra long one. They're giving us a lot of time <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Have you done a lot of this? F Oh, really? Do you do it every day? Wha, D So do you have an opinion on credit cards? You do? I think they get a lot of people in trouble. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and then you don't stop to realize that, D you know, you charge this for twenty, charge that for twenty, charge this for twenty, C and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars C and you don't stop to think about it. I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago D like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble. C And then, D you know, C so I eventually got it all paid. Now I carry one. I have a gas card and a Visa card. C And I never use them unless I need to <sniffing>. C So C but they, Yeah. That's a good idea. Stops all them interest rates, C and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway. C But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially, D you know we have, I'm in Lubbock C and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech, C and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot. Yeah. Gee. Yes, something like that. <<Very faint>> Yeah. D Well, my wife got in trouble one time with hers. She was making D like, A I don't know what she was making, fortyfive dollars a month I think. C And fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit C and fifteen dollars of it was interest C so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month. <Sniffing> C So C and that was before we got married, C so. C But it's, D you know, we sat down and talked about it and discussed it C and it's, it's come out pretty good. Now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college. That's the first thing he wanted. Yeah. C So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick. <<Very faint>> D You know, C so. C But I think they're too readily accessible C and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you dra, get you trapped. E I mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it, C but that's a lot of pain and hassle. When, D you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything, we didn't have such things as credit cards. We just waited until time come around that we could afford it. C And D you know, we had all the necessities, C so <sniffing>. C And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities. I always use it for something I want not something I need. D So, <<Very faint>> Yeah. I think if card cards were as, as stringent as say a, a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to, D you know, be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills, we probably wouldn't have the problems we have. <Sniffing> Of course, we wouldn't have the retail market we have either C so I guess they trade one for the other. I disagree with it, C but they still trade one for the other. D Well, that's good. I'm, it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for, you sound pretty young, C so <sniffing>. Are you? Yeah <sniffing>. <Sniffing> All right. Oh. Yeah. <Sniffing> Yeah, it's pretty easy <sniffing>. F Uh, we have a eighteen year old, seventeen year old, and a seven year old. <<Very faint>> Yeah. F Oh, are you? <<Very faint>> Are you a, you're a Mormon then? <<Very faint>> F Oh, <sniffing> all right <sniffing>. What's that? F Oh, yeah. They may not, they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays <sniffing>. F Uh, fifteen or twenty I guess. F Oh, yeah. I try to every day. I, F uh, I get calls at work, I get calls at home, C so.
