The question was on lawn and garden work. F Um, how do you like it? F Oh, what kind do you have? <Laughter>. Do they really? Oh. F Oh, C and I know somebody that lives there, C and they never mentioned that problem <laughter>. F Oh, my. They probably just take it for granted then. F Oh, yuck <laughter>. I don't have that problem, F uh, it's, mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that, F uh, I, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work. C And so I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part, like putting in the annuals and things like that. C But I don't like, I don't like it dirty <laughter>. No, I don't know. We got the, we got the question C and I thought, F oh, this is going to be interesting. Two bits I'll get a man to talk <laughter> to me, because they get stuck doing it all. C But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work. C And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home C so, F um, we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall. Today we just had a lot of rain <laughter>. Yeah, C so it's kind of nice. I don't know how yours has been. F Oh, I see. Okay. D Well, we're leaving tomorrow C and we're going down to New Orleans C and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there, C and I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity. C But, F um, as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know, F uh, too much, too much about, F uh, how much I really r, do enjoy it myself. Do you like it at all? D Well, how about when you were in Colorado? Uhhuh. D Well, C and then, too, D now D like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high. C And, F uh, if you have that on a regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry <laughter> to keep it off, D you know. C But, F uh, C and with children, F um, you probably don't have time anyhow to, to get into it. It's so, F uh, D okay, very good. I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter, since <laughter> neither one is really into gardening, are we? <Laughter>. Right. Okay. Right. Nice talking with you. Uhhuh, bye. D Well, I don't do much of it here. I'm from, F uh, Te, from, F uh, Colorado originally C and there are no bugs there. C And I didn't mind getting in the dirt there, C but, boy, I'll tell you what, once I see these bugs around here, I'm just kind of out of it. F Oh, roaches and, F Oh, yes. Cockroaches are awful here. Just awful. C So I, F Oh, you're kidding, you're kidding. No, it's a d, D well, maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here. C And, F uh, It must be. If they lived here, a lot of people I know just say, F oh, I just <baby> stomp on them. It doesn't matter. They make good fertilizer in the garden. <Laughter> Me, personally can't, Uhhuh. <Baby>. Uhhuh <baby>. No <laughter>. I have to, D you know I have to say that's not <child_talking> exactly my favorite thing either really <baby_crying>. <Laughter>. <Baby_crying>. <Baby>. F Huh. <Baby> F Oh, really? D Well, it's been real hot here lately. E I mean we've had to actually have the airconditioning on and everything C but, F uh, doe, it's supposed to rain again now, F uh, this weekend. <<Very faint>> C So, then, Yeah. Yeah. I, D well, <child_talking> not here. E I mean it's just, here <child_talking> I just can't stand to even get out in the, F uh, in the dirt <laughter>. Just, D Well, I liked it a <child_talking> little bit C but I didn't, F uh, I was <child_talking> working at that time fulltime and didn't have a lot of time, for that C and so that I think really, F um, hampered it a little bit. Yeah. No. Not really <laughter>. <<Very faint>>. Uhhuh. Sounds like i, No, no. Afraid not. F Uh, hopefully they'll give a subject I like one of these times <laughter>. Something I really know a lot about. Wh, nice talking to you. Okay, byebye.
