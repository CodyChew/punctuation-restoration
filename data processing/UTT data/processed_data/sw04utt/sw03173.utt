All right, why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next. Uhhuh. C And, of course, it has to have airconditioning <laughter>. Does it have to be a special color? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. It sounds like something your husband would drive, right? <Laughter>. Yes. D Well, I don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one, C but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts, of course, C and we wanted airconditioning and a five speed C and that was kind of iffy, C but that made it better economically, C so, Yeah. We'll probably have to look for another second car sometime C and we'd look for about what you're looking for. C S, C but probably real cheap, too. It <laughter> wouldn't be a used, used car, C so, C but, no <breathing>. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Would you like four doors C or doesn't really matter. Yeah, it, it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes. <Laughter>. It would be fun just to win one, wouldn't it <laughter>? That would be great. All right, D well, I think that's all that we need to say. All right, we'll talk to you later. Byebye. I think our next car, I would like something like a, an economy car that gets really good mileage and, F uh, one that's really reliable. I would, I think probably not a, a brand new car, C but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra. Or something like that, F uh, something my husband, F Oh, absolutely, airconditioning and a radio, F uh, A M, F M and a cassette player C and, F uh, what else do I want <breathing>. F Uh, I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice. D You know, a, a navy blue or a, Yeah, that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work. I think that's something we might want, too, is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic. I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that, F uh, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed <laughter>. Prob, D well probably, probably that would be a good idea, yeah. That's right. C So if we wanted it to take people out it's, that's a good thought. I, that hadn't crossed my mind. Yes, I would go for that. D Well, thank you for calling. All right. Bye.
