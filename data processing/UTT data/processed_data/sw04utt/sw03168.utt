Okay. F Uh, D well, since I initiated the call, I guess I'll start off first. F Uh, number one, I have absolutely no problem with random testing. F Uh, I spend an awful lot of time <breathing> traveling on the job C and I feel, <breathing> I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for, particularly airline pilots and the such. I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now, based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers. C So I really don't have a problem with it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I, D well, I happen to be, F uh, my job is I'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company, C so I, it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause, this type of thing. C And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs C and we, at the present time, do not have random testing. C And I am pushing towards that. I, I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide, they shouldn't have a problem with it. C And if they are trying to hide something, then I have to know that, because we're t, we're talking major liabilities. Not only with themselves, but with other employees. C And I really, D you know, they, they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I, I would much, much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested <Laughter> on a random basis. I, I have a real fear, C but that at some point something's going to happen. C And they're showing it with AIDS, C so why, D you know, they sh, they ought to start doing something with the drugs <lipsmack>. C So I really have no problem with it. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, really? D Well, that scares me because if th, that's the way they are, I, if I were a dentist, I'd want to be protected, too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, you, where you're located, I, I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing. C And I think they've had it for several years. C And they're program they had, I don't think had a lot of, F uh, problems associated with it, C but, F uh, my brotherinlaw happens to work there C and it, it sounded very positive. C And I, I think it's great. I, I would like, I would encourage it. I'm pushing our company towards that.. Right. Exactly. Uhhuh. Right. Ours is changing. Yeah, ours, ours is changing, it's increasing. I live in a <breathing>, I live in a very nice suburb C and it's, it's, it's unbelievable what, what, what's going on and the drugs, the selling of drugs. It's just, it's just too loose. It's too free. Uhhuh. Really? Yeah. F Uh, I don't either. I, F uh, I've never, I don't work, at home right now. I stay home with my children. F Uh, C but my husband works C and they do have that at his place of employment C and neither of us have a problem with it. We've, particularly, like you said with the things that the airlines and, and such. It's, F uh, it's a scary thing to know that, F uh, you just don't know what people are doing F uh, before they go to work. C So, C and the, the advertisements on television lately have been so, F uh, there have been so many. D You know, there's, F uh just about D like train tr, train wrecks and things like that, that I feel like, probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something I'd like to know that's going on. F Um. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, it's, it's unfortunate, I think, that everyone doesn't have that opinion. F Uh, some people just, F uh, I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that, C but, F uh, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep talking about the, F uh, the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, D you know, they feel that's not fair and whatever, C but, D you know, those kind of things I'd like to know <laughter> myself. It wouldn't be, in my opinion, I, I've had a lot of dental work done, C and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all, C so that kind of, yeah. C And, F uh, C so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me. D Well, you would think so. That is, because, D well, C and I worked for a dentist C and that's, F uh, D you know, you, you come in contact with a lot of, of blood and things like that C and it's real, real dangerous. I, I would think, C but, with all the accidents, just with, with, F uh, everything happening with, just airlines just drive me crazy. People are afraid to fly now. D You know, just because of, they don't know what their pilot's been doing and, and things like that C and, I don't know. Uhhuh. D Well, C and, D you know, if they do find someone who, who is, F uh, having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need. As opposed to just letting the problem go on with, without any, F uh, support. And whatever, C because a lot of people, seems like, would probably obviously are trying to hide that F uh, from their employer and friends and family and things C and too many people are just dying. Particularly in our area. I don't know what the crime is like where you are, C but the crime rate here is just astronomical. Uhhuh. I just got a piece of paper the other day, F uh, that now they have these, I have two little, very little children, under two C and I got a piece of paper from, from my husband's office, it's talking about these, F uh, drug tattoos now that they have got. That look like, it looks like a sticker C and it's for kid,
