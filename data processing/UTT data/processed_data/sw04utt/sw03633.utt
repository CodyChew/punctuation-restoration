return anything. <Throat_clearing>. Right. Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee, yeah. The only thing I've had lately is, F uh, my kids got all these Barbie <ringing> kind of toys for, F uh, Christmas C and, F uh, i, it takes them less than a day C and they're broken in one way or another. C But I don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, F uh, <child> maybe those type of products sh, should be for older kids <child>. I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them <noise>. C And, F uh, I don't think they're unduly rough, C but maybe they are. I don't know. C But, F uh, a lot of the little Barbie sets <ringing> they come with real <throat_clearing> little pieces <noise> C and they're easily lost and easily broken C but, . It's been a while since they've, F uh, gone through the Barbie stuff. Right. Don't remember her breaking, F uh, D Well, that's one thing they've got. They've got every type of imaginable, camping on the beach, and all of these come with, F oh, D like tiny, tiny little plates and little sunglasses. C And, F uh my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll, C and so I finally got her a Ken doll, C and, F uh, less than a week later the arm was broken. C But they were real good about replacing it. That's one nice thing, is they're real good about replacing it. Right. D Well, the, the, D you know, those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and she's not that strong, that I would she's not that big of a girl that I think could really <breathing> take a grip on it like a bigger kid could, D you know. Yes. That was about it. C And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff C but, F Oh, is that right? D Well, do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things? Don't buy them because you don't need them. Yes. F Oh, yeah.. Yes. D Well, you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it, it's usually bef, before that warranty would expire any, the first one. You never nee, even needed it. <Child>. It's time to replace it. Yes. I think these extended warranties are gimmicks, really. A lot of it. We bought, when we first married, we bought one on our T V <lipsmack> C and that there's, it was a five year, after the first five years, C and it was ridiculous. Yes. They're a pretty healthy price, C and you're trying to think F oh, maybe I'll need this. You never, you always think gosh, if I say no, then I won't, D you know. C But, I don't know. You probably got your worth out of it anyway. Yes, the little, D well, you probably are real careful of the brands you buy C and the, when you do buy things, you <child_yelling> probably watch what kind of, type of. Yes. D Well, really, the only things that I have returned have not been faulty, it's been because of the size or some problem like that. I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to. Uhhuh. What age are your children? Uhhuh <breathing>. Uhhuh. D Well, my daughter is twentyone now, C so it's been a while since we've had Barbie things <laughter>. C But we did have Barbies, we did have Barbies and things, C and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already, F oh, D like, D you know, third, fourth, fifth grade. C So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it, C but, F uh, I don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff. No, I don't. C But I also don't remember lots of little pieces They've got so many different things with it now. Goodness. F Oh, dear. D Well, F uh, I guess if they'll replace them, then they assume they shouldn't have broken. Any direction. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. The main thing that they've, they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes. D You know, that was about it. Uhhuh. C And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics. My, my children are twentyone and twentyfive and twentyeight. Uhhuh C and, No, not really. We, F uh, haven't had that much, D you know, problem with things that we have bought. They seem to, to last. In fact, when they offer us extended warranties, we, we don't buy them because we've, We don, we find we don't need them. C And, F uh, it seems like it's just a, an added tack on. C Plus a lot of the credit cards now, D you know, will guarantee, if you purchase on your credit card D you know, then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time, C so it seems like it's a waste of money. Uhhuh. C And D like I've even bought, on a recliner once I bought, D you know, a, a, an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that, C and I never used it. C And so it seems ridiculous. C And D like <breathing>, washers and dryers and things like that, I've never had one go out. In fact, they usually, when they do go out, it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix C and we don't even have a repairman come, C or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing. Uhhuh. C So, E I mean, I do too. Uhhuh. C And they charge you a pretty good price for them too. Uhhuh. D Well, my husband finally just put his foot down C and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore, C and if it goes out, D well D you know. Uhhuh, C and, F uh, C so we really have been fairly happy wi, with things, C but D now we take good care of things C and we don't, F uh, run out and buy a lot of, of things either. C And since our kids aren't little anymore, I'm not buying a lot of those little things <laughter> that can get broken. D Well, you look at the consumer guide. C And, F uh, you go around C and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the,
