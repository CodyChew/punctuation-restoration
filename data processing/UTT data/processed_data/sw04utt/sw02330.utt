There we go. I think that's true. The, F uh, the Bermuda grass is greening up in March, C and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April. C So. C So I think we're a little hea, ahead of schedule on that. That's true. It's been a, a fun break, C but the break is over. Yeah, D now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny. D Well, yeah, C but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not. D Well, that's good. Yeah, that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year. I think, I haven't seen the wea, the weather on the news in the evening lately, C but I think the average high would be, should be about seventy. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. F Um, one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninetynine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high. C And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much. E I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah. One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twentysix degree lightening storm. I, D you know, I was going into the grocery store, C and a, a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead, C and it was twenty six degrees out. C And I thought, D Well gee, I've, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature. That's right. It, F uh, it probably was a lot warmer up high. Sometimes they get those inversions, like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing. The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees. The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away. Nope. Yep, I, I'm really enjoying this now. D Well, this has been interesting. Not too challenging to the brain. Nope. All right, Ellen, D well you have a good day. Bye. Yeah. D Well, F uh, I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year. Yeah. Yeah, I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon, C and I noticed all that grass coming up, C and I thought, ooh, we've got to start this mowing bit soon <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, F um, F oh, I guess another thing I've noticed, too, here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days, it's been awfully gray, D you know, just, Yeah. C But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray <laughter>. F Oh, I go for that, yeah. In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here. We have a long weekend C and, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side. I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening, C but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow C and then the rest will be without rain. C But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties. That's getting back to a little bit chillier. Yeah. I'm not certain either, C but you're probably right. D Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, F uh, maybe seventyfive to eighty, somewhere in there. I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm. I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature. F Um. Yeah. You're probably right. Yes, as a matter of fact, I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. D You know it wasn't just a super bad storm, C but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late spring time. F Oh, wow. F Um. Yeah, that, that is pretty unusual. C And you really take notice of it, too. F Um. Wow. I don't, don't like that super cold stuff. I just don't move very well <laughter> when it's that cold. Yeah, D well. <Laughter> Not, not a real in depth topic, but enjoyed talking to you. Okay. Byebye.
