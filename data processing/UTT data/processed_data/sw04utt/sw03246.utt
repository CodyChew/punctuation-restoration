Do you see anything wrong with public school systems? I agree. Yes, C and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas, C and the, the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students, C and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children everything had to be documented, C and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids, it was filled with documentation yes. Me, too. I think so too. They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency, D you know, C and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best, she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder C and, That's right. I know. That's right. Do you have children in the system? Oh. Yep. Are you in Plano? Yep, I am too. C And I have one in ninth grade at Clark C and one at Hendrick this year, C and he, my nin, my, F uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews, C and the very first year I taught back in seventythree, we had open classroom C and it didn't work then C and when we moved down here, I was just appalled that they were still doing it here, Partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school C so he spent all day in this one large open area, C so, I didn't really care for that. It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here. That was our last tour, in Michigan. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow. Yes. Yes, that's right. We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system. Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are D so. As a freshman? Yep. Yeah. My daughter seems to be having a good time, she was absent with strep throat the last three days, C and I ran over and picked up her report card, C and she did very good, C so C and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have. She's not bogged down, C but yet she has some every night. Yes, you always hear how good. Now my son's at, junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful C but, who knows what he's going to bring home. D Well, yes, I do. F Um, I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way. I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job. Do you? Do you have children in the public school system? Is that right. You were a bookkeeper <laughter>. Oh. F Oh, no. D Well, F um, I'm, I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back, C and, C and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, D you know, I love to work with children and to teach them, C but I'm really having questions if, if I can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, D you know, what I do. I don't think, I don't think it's the teachers, I think it's the system C but, F um. Right. What child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to that's, that's true. D Well, it's, it's hard on the children too, I think, D you know, because the, F um, the teachers are overworked C and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best, D you know, F um. I have two, I have, in the system one is in ninth grade C and one is in seventh grade, C and them, F um, I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year. We, F um, live in a district that has open classrooms, C and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her. Yes. You too. Oh. Still at it. D Well the explanation <noise> I was, was given about, D you know, they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working, C but they didn't have the money to restructure, C but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, E I mean, some kind of partitions D you know, Just, yeah. F Oh, goodness. Oh. Were they? D Well, we were from North, F um, Carolina, C and of course North, North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education. I think they rank about fortyninth C but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program, C and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade, they, they changed classes several times during the day, which has its pros and cons, C but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes C and it was wonderful C so, D you know, I'm coming to, to Plano thinking, D Well, gosh, it's going to be really great, it's ranked so much better <laughter>. Isn't that interesting, I, I, I don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money, I don't know. I guess so. D Well, my son is at Clark this year too, C so, F uh, we're Yeah. C And, F uh, <noise> he's pleased with his classes. I, I, I don't guess I've been in <noise> the high school long enough <noise> to, to know what to expect really D you know, how to judge it. D Well, that's good. Yeah. D Well, Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any, C so, that's interesting, C but, he, his grades, I haven't seen them yet, C but supposedly they're good, C so, <Laughter>. <Laughter>. That's right.
