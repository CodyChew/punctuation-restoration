Are you a player? Has it? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I hav, I haven't played in about two years, C and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here. I work at T I. C And I played in a tournament out there, C and I shot a net fiftynine. They were kind of, little upset. I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits. I have a hard time inventing shots, D you know. Let's go around this tree, and D you know, try a slice through a hook here, C and I can't do that C so. I finally got out, C and I've been watching quite a few videos. I had not been able to play C so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while, C and I, I hope I'm on the right track. Shot a career low eightynine, C so, C and my handicap is twenty nine. I like that. Really. Yeah, I've tried to get my wife, I bought her a set of clubs four years ago. She hasn't even swung them, C but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day, she's she's ready to get off into it, C but, D you know, I like, I just like getting out, being in the outdoors, C and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway, C but, D you know. D You know, at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf C and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really. C And I, D you know, I walk, I don't ride C so D you know, I get a little exercise there, too, C so. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty nice. We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not. They were amazed. D You know, here it is, sixtyfive degrees, we're out playing golf, C and they're freezing cold back there, C so. C But, I, F uh, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, D you know, when I got into the service I got into it C and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go, C and then one, one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf. C And I said, D Well, yeah, D you know, I've got my clubs, C but I haven't swung them in quite a few years. C And then I got into it and then back out of it, C and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there <laughter>. D You know, I really enjoy it. It's really nice. Yeah. Yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death, C but. No. C And then, D you know, we've got some guys here that they are, D you know, four and five handicappers C and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them, C so. D You know, C but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time. C And I've, D you know, I've never, never yet have I walked up, D now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with, C and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome. They are always friendly. Sure, come on out, D you know, C and they don't mind if you make a mistake, they don't mind saying, D Well, D you know, let me tea, tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or, D You know, it's, it's pretty nice and friendly out there C and you can't find that in all sports. Yeah, Yeah, you need to, Yeah. F Oh yeah, we, we have one down here in the summertime. F Uh, it runs from D like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, D you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten. C And we play in the summertime out here. We get a mixed league in, C and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for. It's going to start, D well, when we change time back whenever that is next month, I guess, C and it will start then, C and, D you know, we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago, C and they were just starting to learn, C and, D you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty C but they were, D you know, now they're down into the hundreds nineties, C so, it won't take her long. D You know, C And it's something we can do together, C so. D Well, she doesn't do much hunting, she could care less about that. She's does a little fishing, C but, D you know, golf would give her the exercise, she'd be outside, give her something to do that we both enjoy, C so. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, C and it's, D you know, it's a game that you don't, like bowling, D you know, you feel bad if you bowl a hundred. C But if you shoot a hundred in golf, D you know, you don't have to be an expert to play, Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right. C So, D you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all. Yeah. Yeah. C And when, D you know when I first got back into it, I used to get mad because I knew I could do something C and I didn't get it done. D You know, C and I just, D well, I need to slice this ball around here, I naturally slice anyway, D now D you know, the ball will go straight C and I go <noise>, I never broke a club or anything, C but, D you know I'd get upset about it sometimes, C and now I guess, D you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit. I don't get upset any more. C So, C and, D Well, I've enjoyed talking to you. I guess I'll go back to work. All right. See you later. Byebye. F Uh, I, I think I am. It's, it's been a while now <laughter>. Yeah, I've, F uh, F oh, just recently I got married C and we bought a house. We're about fifty yards from the golf course C but unfortunately the house is taking up my time. C So it's been, F uh, it's been almost a year, I guess, since I've actually, F uh, swung a club for a purpose. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. That's, that's great. Yeah. Now it's, F uh, like I say, it's been a while for me, too. I, F uh, I've got my wife motivated about it, F um C and, F uh, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her, get her a set of clubs C and, F uh, we'll get out of the driving range and, and get some interest built up C and hopefully we can, F uh, we can start in. Really. D Well, great, great. That's good, Yeah, same thing here. Right, right. Uhhuh, yeah. That's, I've got the same attitude. I, F uh, I tell you, I started, I guess, the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now, when I was in college. C And, F uh, I took, F uh, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while, C and then finally got, got into it when I was, while I was still in school C and since then, F uh, we've made it, F um, as, as the friends start getting married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, F uh, having a, a Thursday, F um, D well, have, have probably D like, D like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding. C And, F uh, C so, it, that's back in South Dakota where I grew up C and, F uh, C so that, that's, F uh, that's been my main, my main involvement, is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here, C but, F uh eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas, C and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home. Yeah. Yep, yep. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's right. F Oh, it is, it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's, F uh, that's got the same level of interest. That seem to be the hardest thing. D Well, about, that's, that's true of any sport, D you know. If you want to play tennis, or racquetball, Right, C and, C and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time, D you know C and, C and, F uh, Uhhuh. Right. That's right, yeah. That's true. That's true. Well. That, that's, that's so. Yeah, that's absolutely right, C and you can gain a lot of ground doing that, too, if you, if, D you know, you gets, you get in a rut if you do play a lot C but you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything. After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer, then you've basically tapped your resources there. C But, F uh, I'd like to, F uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a league in a, in a mixed, mixed doubles league, or something like that. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Sure. Right. D Well, that's good that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah, it, it sounds like we've got real similar situations. I, I, I go home, F uh, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to, to go pheasant hunting, C and, F uh F um, the, the last time I, I took my wife along C and, F uh, k, kind of the same situation. She's, she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff, C but, She'll definitely, F uh, she'll make the trip for fishing if <laughter> that comes along, C but, F uh it's, it's interesting, That's right. Uhhuh. That's right, D well, yeah, I've, I've kind of formed the attitude that, D you know, if I could just, if I could pick two or three shots out, F uh, out of my game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good C and then, C and I keep, I keep rationalizing that D well, D you know, I can do it, I just got to do it all at th, on the same hole, C and, C and then it will get better, C and you just keep going, C and in the meantime, just enjoy what you're doing. It, it, it really works that way <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. C And D well, that's great. D Well, you bet. Okay, sounds like it. Okay. Bye.
