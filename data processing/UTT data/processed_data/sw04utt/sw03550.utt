Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. F Oh, D well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Yeah. Uhhuh. What do you have now? Uhhuh. F Oh, really. Yeah, we just, we, D well, I have my car is the first one we ever bought new, too. C But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually. <Laughter>. F Uh, mine is a Honda Accord. Yeah, I do, C and, C and, F um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling, C and I, some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors C and, F um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics, C and mine is a standard C and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything. Uhhuh. F Um usually AVIS. AVIS. Yeah. It's just because we're on, I think of it, I'm not sure those are AVIS or not, C but we have corporate contracts D you know, with the various companies C so it depends on your destination, too. Kind of strange <laughter>. Work for T I. D Uhhuh, which is how I heard about this <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. It did, F huh. F Oh, my gosh. F Oh, that was great. That's unusual to hear, usually, D you know something breaks, you look at the warranty C and it's excluded. F Oh, I see, okay. F Oh, you got your money's worth. Yeah. Yeah, that is good. Yeah, D well, I've been lucky. Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it C but I was real lucky because it just hit the, F um the lens to the light. It didn't actually dent the car or anything. C So it cost me twentyfive bucks to replace that, C and the store will pay for it anyway, C so. No big deal. F Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one C but, D you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, D yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided F um, although we did just buy another car, C and that's a Legend F um, C but it's, it's a used one C and, F um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time, C and the fact that, D you know, this c, this car that I have has performed so well, C and before that I also had an Accord, it was a real old one C and, F uh, I bought that used. I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that, C and it served me real well, too. C So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars. C And. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. How did it go for you? <Laughter> Hasn't left you stranded. Yeah I know. Yeah. Really. F Huh. D Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend it's windy. I can't drive that, the Legend, it's just so huge. I, I don't like it, C and it's so, F uh, All right. D Well, what kind of car would I want to buy. I don't know. The question is, E I mean, would I want to buy, C or would I, would I probably actually <laughter> buy. May be two different things. If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter. No, in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know. I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche Turbo. C But, F uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now. Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me. C But I maybe would buy a B M W. F Uh, or, or even a Volvo. I've got a, F uh, a Dodge Daytona. It's actually the first car we ever bought new. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah me too <laughter>. D So what car do you drive? What is it? Uhhuh, we almost bought one of those. Do you like it? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing. Yeah. F Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars. To what, AVIS? Really. Huh. I guess, I see. Uhhuh. Right. You work for a big company, then. T I, I see. Uhhuh. F Um, C but <laughter> yeah, I, I, F uh, I don't know, I would probably, if I were to buy a car mys, D you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, D you know, like a Honda Accord. Maybe it would, one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, F uh, this seven year warranty. F Um, C and it really saved us some big money once. Yeah, they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time <laughter> C and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars, C and I had to pay twenty five for the, Yeah, <laughter> it was. D Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension C and, F uh, at the time we bought it it was like, D you know, A I don't know, four hundred and twentyfive dollars or something extra. Yeah, we did, C but, D you know, we really debated at the beginning, C and of course I'm glad I did it. C But, F um, we still have, we still have D like, D you know, coup, three years left on it. F Oh, no. Bumper? Oh. D Well, that was good. Are you. Uhhuh. F Um, if you were, if you were going to, F uh, buy a new car would you buy another, F uh, another Accord? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, those are nice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, my sister drives one. She drives a, F uh, A I don't know, is it Legend it's a, I'm not certain, <laughter> C but she's liked it. F Um, C But, I, I have, I have never had, C and we, in fact, what I'm driving right now, we bought a, we only had one car for a long time, C and C and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing. C And so, F uh, I bought a used Yugo just to be a little, D you know, little car that I could care less about . F Oh, D well, it's, F uh, it's worked. E I mean, that's exactly what it is, D you know, it's just a, it's a cheap little little car just to go, D you know, run around town in C and, F uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive. I, I, D you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. D You know it's D like too, too mushy, C and it, D you know it's an automatic, C and it's too, the steering D you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, D you know, it's kind of, Oh.
