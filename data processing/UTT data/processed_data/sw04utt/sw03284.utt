D Well, F uh, C and that's an idea that's been around for, kicked around for a long time. I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered, F uh, as far as close to passing, F uh, any legislation or anything like that. C But, F uh, I believe Israel does that, don't they for their, D Wel, everybody has to do, has to do something. C Or maybe, maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone. C But, F uh, Okay. No, I don't think it's, it's necessa, n, I think of that. It, it couldn't be. Military service is not that much C but, the, m, military used to do it C but the idea that, F uh, <lipsmack> there are things that, that do need to be done that could be done C and then, F uh, country would benefit from one year from, from everybody and even out the, <<very faint>> the, F uh, requirement. D Well, D now that's a thought. Yeah. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. F Oh, yeah, I'm afraid you're right there. C But, F uh, C but, F uh, anything like this that came up whether it, it quickly would be <breathing> significant industry in, in figuring out how to get around it where people, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, I suspect that the, D yeah, that, that, that that's not the thing. That they, that they don't feel it's open to them it's just that they, F uh, are more selfcentered if you will and not, not considering, a voluntary, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. yeah. C And, F uh, now I didn, I don't know it di, I, I think you're right that that's not the, not the way that the society these days is going, C and I, I think we need to, we need to try to figure out some way to, to turn that around that everybody, F Huh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that could be. Yeah, right. Yeah, I, I agree with that, C and, F uh, C and I, I, <sigh> I don't know what, <sigh> what has, what has set it off or what C but i, it, it certainly seems to me that, that, F uh, F uh, things in, in the last twentythree years, F uh, things hav, have definitely gone towards, F uh, very much the concentration on self and, and loss of, loss of perspective in terms, F Uh, yes, I think so. F Uh, Yeah, I don't kn, Yeah, I believe that's right. C And, F uh, <breathing> C and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about. Yeah, for, for kids in high school, it could be in the summertime. F Uh, D you know, F um, it, it could even be done while they're doing another job, while they're doing, D you know, a job to make money. C But, F uh, <breathing> it's, F uh, D you know, such a grassroots idea that it, I think the family would have to be involved in it. C And people would have to be convinced that, D you know, I, I think the, the basic message is that giving is better than receiving <laughter>. C And that's not the kind of society we have right now. There's lots and lots of volunteer programs C and, F uh, C but most of those are at l, least it, it's my opinion that most of those involve adults. Adults who have the time to give and, and, F uh, D you know, the desire to, to give. It's not, F uh, D you know it's not, F uh, maybe the, maybe it cou, F uh, younger people feel like it's not open to them, I don't know. C But it should be if it's not. Yeah, it is kind of an introspective time of life. C But some schools, some high schools have actually started a program of D like a visitation program to, F uh, D you know, areas economically, F uh D say less advantaged areas. C And, F uh, they, they promote service on the part of the kids to, to, F uh, some of those people. C So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess. It's really, it's really unfortunate because <throat_clearing> when you do, I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association. C And I have, have done, F uh, gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society. C And there's, there's no question that doing, D you know, doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than, F uh, than the people involved. F Uh, it's, it's really a gift to yourself C and, C and that's, I think that's a really important lesson to learn. C And, C and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not, F uh, not really happy, D you know. C Because <sigh> if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, D you know <laughter>. F Uh, it really is better to give then to receive.
