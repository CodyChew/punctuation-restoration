Okay, what kind of hobbies do you have? Uhhuh. I like to read, too <laughter>. I was trying to think of some while, while it was, F uh, talking about it, C and then I, it took so long for someone to answer, I started reading the newspaper, and kind of forgot about it <laughter>. C But, F uh, yeah, I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can, you can do a little bit at a time, whereas, I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it or if I had the space. I live in a pretty small apartment, C and, F uh, I would have to, D you know, put stuff away. I have two cats, C so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something. Reading is a little bit easier to work around. That's right. That's true, I do the same thing <laughter>. What types of crafts do you do? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. I enjoy, F uh, sewing and needlework also. I've, I've, F uh, made some small things, cross stitch things. C And, F um back when I was in high school, I worked at a needlework shop, C and I, I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that, C and I, I still remember how to do it. It's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that. C But I have recently done some cross stitch. C And I enjoy doing that. It's just the same old thing, it's just getting the time to do it <laughter>. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah, it takes a lot of concentration. E I mean, it was the type of thing, I was, I was making some little things for Christmas, C and I also made a little thing for a baby gift, C and, F uh, I thought, F Oh, I can do this while I watch T V. Wrong <laughter>. No, you must pay all attention to what you're doing. It's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be. It took me, F uh, quite a bit of time. I though, F Oh, this won't take long at all. C But I was wrong. It took, it took a while to do. C But, it was fun, I enjoyed it. F Oh my gosh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty understandable. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <<Pause>> I'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby. F Um. I don't even watch T V very much. I was tonight, C but <laughter>, Yeah. Yeah I do, I do like to go to movies, C and I have a V C R, C so I like to rent movies, C and, F um, I have, right now I have the movie channel, C so I've recorded quite a few movies off of that. F Um, just, I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now, C and whenever I go visit my parents, they're always saying, D Well, bring some of your tapes <laughter>. They always borrow a few of them. I was over there, they live in Duncanville C and I was over there at Easter, C and they said, Bring some tapes with you. C So they are always borrowing my tapes. C But, F uh, I like to, I like to do, F uh, stuff with plants. I like, F um, I have a lot of plants in my apartment, C and I've got a pretty small porch, C but it's, it's, F uh, I've got a few planters out there that I, I'll, F uh, D you know, in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there, C and then in the summer I'll plant petunias, C or something that's colorful C and D like, that blooms a lot. C But haven't done that yet. I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time, C but I think we're probably past that now. I probably should go buy some. I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening, some. I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that. Yeah, I like the planting, and watering is okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I don't know too much about it either. Mine's pretty limited to my little, F uh, porch plants <laughter>. C And then the ones in my apartment, half of which don't look real healthy, C but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots. C And so that's probably my problem there. C But, No, I never have tried that, just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony. C And my other two pots are, they're kind of, they're pretty big, C and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area, C so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood, there's no room for much else. C But my dad, F uh, my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house. C And I'd, I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff. C But I've never really tried anything like that since then. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I enjoy playing with my cats. I don't know if you'd call that a hobby, C but I have two cats, C and I gave them a bath tonight, C so they're a little bit angry at me <laughter>. They didn't like it too much. Yeah, F oh yeah right in the tub, C and it helps because its the time of the year that they're shedding a lot, and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine. C So I thought, this'll help, D you know, help them shed, C and sure enough, boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub. C So, they're pretty content now, C but they were mad at me for quite a while. They went and hid after they, after they got dried off. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I like both, C but since I'm in an apartment, I just, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog. Dogs, to me, dogs need a yard, even little dogs. They just need a yard. Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine. C But I just think dogs need, need to be outside, though. C So, Yeah, now that's an idea <laughter> with the small babies. Yeah, C because, you kind of, even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something. There not as likely to as a dog might, I guess. C But with little ones, I'd be kind of scared <laughter>, to get anything that has teeth or claws. F Oh yeah. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh <<pause>>. Yeah, probably C so, C and I'm out of, out of good ideas for a hobby <laughter> anyway. D Well it was good talking to you. All right. Byebye. F Um, mostly what I do, I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing, C and then I, I read a lot. Oh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, you can pick it up and take it wherever you go. any space. I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing. <Laughter> You get so involved in what you're reading. I do a little bit of woodworking, D well, I used to. I don't have the equipment here. We moved to Dallas about a year ago C and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment C and I did some of that. F Um, here I've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand, F um, sewing and quilting and, F um, <<pause>> what else have I done <laughter>? Things to hang on the wall. Mostly just stuff that I can, D you know, use right around the house or give away as gifts. I've been making a lot of quilts, D well, not a lot, but several quilts lately. D So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I've done some cross, F um, cross stitch, C but I never count right, C and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or, or something. It never has worked out completely. <Laughter> Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. The first project I started out one was a big one, it was, F uh, it was of a lady C and she was kneeling, C and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe. C And I, it was just too much to start with. C And I still haven't finished it, because I, I stopped, C and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done. C And there were so many different shadings and colors, C and, C and, it was just too much to begin with. C And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more <laughter> with it. C And I've done some of the crewel and the, F um something similar to that C but it doesn't have the specific stitches. Anyway, it's a little bit more loose, and not quite as structured, C and I like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that. More like embroidery or something. Yeah. I was reading when you called. How about movies, do you like to go to movies? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well we, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it's the hard work. It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers, it's so beau, E I mean, we don't. We live in an apartment also. I've got a few plants here, C but I'm not really knowledgeable. I feel real good if I water them C and they continue to grow. D You know, I feel like, F Oh, I've accomplished something. C So I enjoy it, C but I'm just not experienced enough with it. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Have you tried any, growing any, F um, D like fruits and vegetables or anything? I guess vegetables are in, insi, D like in pots and stuff? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I considered it last year C and this year both, C but I haven't done anything about it. C So. I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch. We get lots of sunlight here, C and the porch is screened in C and it's pretty large. C So, F um, I think if I just would be, if I'd do something, be motivated enough to do something, I think it would work out well. C But, C but there goes that motivation thing again <laughter>. <Laughter>. Can you can you put them right in the water? F Oh, that's good, <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Sulked for a while, F huh <laughter>. D Well, I like animals, C but we don't have any yet. We have a nine month old with another on the way C and we thought, D well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll, C or get into a house with a little more space. I'd love to have, have some animals. C But I like dogs C and my husband likes cats. C So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet. If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great, C but until then, Uhhuh. I agree with you. I, if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, D you know <laughter>. Something small that she can watch, but won't take too much care. Uhhuh. Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting, D you know, that they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk. C And if I was a cat or dog, I'd respond probably by biting or something. I don't know. That'd be my self defense. C But, D Well, I think we probably reached our time limit. <Laughter> F Oh, okay. Thank you for calling. Byebye.
