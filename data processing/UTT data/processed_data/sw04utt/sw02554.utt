D Well, what do you think about it? No, I don't either. I don't think it's going to change very much C but <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, D you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy. C And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in, in Iraq, they're going crazy. <Laughter> D You know, E I mean you can't please them one way or the other. D You know, C and I, C and I think that, I, I agree with you, this is exactly the right course. E I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq. It has nothing to do with us. C And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business. F Um, All the time. E I mean, yeah, E I mean, Yeah. Yeah, C and it's certainly, C and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years. C And it's going to continue. As long as you have so many diverse groups that are, that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time. E I mean the Kurds have tried it before. They've gotten their butts kicked, C and this is just another time that it's happening. D You know, they'll regroup out in the mountains C and they'll try it again in a couple of years. Sure, C and, C and, C and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. D You know. C But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. I, that would have been stupid, C and, C and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right. I don't think they would have done that. C But it just, it, it really doesn't make any difference. This is just a, a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history. F Oh, sure, E I mean the, the British occupied the place, the French occupied it, we've done it. It, it's happened so many times, this is, this is really nothing special. F Uh, That's right, it's al, it's mostly religious anyway. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. D Well, I, I, I think one of the big problems, E I mean looking at it from the Am, the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners. They don't understand what, E I mean their politics really isn't politics. It's religion couched as politics. C And there's a big difference. D You know, F uh, we sit there C and, C and we think that they think the way we think. C And that's a big mistake, because they don't. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's it a lot of the time. I, I was stationed in, in Turkey for, for a year and a half. C And it, it was tough, under, understanding those folks. D You know, it, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously, it's just, it was very strange. It was very interesting. D Now I, shoot, I, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't, don't have a clue sometimes. D You know they, they sit there and, and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert. D Well, I'm not real sure that's, that's appropriate. No. D Well, I sort, that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country, too. C And we make experts by reading books. D You know, C and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing. Yeah. Yeah. I, F uh, I, I guess you work for T I. C So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else. Yeah. It's, it's like our car industry, the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese, D you know, came into it and helped, us out. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and until we, until we start changing our educational system, E I mean we're, we're going to be, we're, we've already been overtaken, C but it's going to get even worse later. E I mean looks who's, looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything. It's not us. D You know, we, we've got folks running around here who get, who get degrees in basket weaving and D you know, underwater psychology, or some, some ridiculous stuff like that. C And, C and where are the engineers coming from? Yeah, exactly. My, F uh, my roommate is a, F uh, he's getting his doctorate in industrial, D well, it's not industrial engineering, it's human factors. His degree was in, F uh, industrial engineering. F Uh, C and he's from the Philippines. C And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it. He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs. D You know, F uh, C but I, I see it all too often. E I mean we've got loads of foreign students C and they're coming here, going after the hard degrees C and then they're going back to Korea and Japan, and Hong Kong and everywhere else C and they're applying it there. C And <laughter> I don't know, it's, to me it's amazing. I don't know what we're going to do as a country. We're, we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later. Uhhuh. Yeah you, I don't, I don't think there can be anymore long range planning. I think it, it's, it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike. D You know, it, F oh, here's a crisis. D Well, let's plug it up. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. It's far beyond me. Yeah, all we can do is keep plugging. D You know, I, I wonder, I, I read in the paper just last week, I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer. D Well, at a price tag of six thousand bucks, I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers. Be, now I have the I, I have the I B M, P S two C but I'm sorry I got it. It's slow, it's, F uh, there are many better machines on the market right now for a, the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school C and I saved fortyeight percent, C so I said, D yeah, if I can have an I B M for fortyeight percent discount, I'll take it. C But up to that point I had nev, I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name. C But now you watch, just sure as anything, the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it. Uhhuh. It's already outdated. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I, I can imagine. I, F uh, years ago, I remember when I had a T I ninetynine. Put all the money into the expansion box and all this, that and the other C and, F uh, things just kept changing so much C and I kept getting rid of them, C and I finally said, D well, you can't do this <laughter>. You've got to buy something and stick with it, C so I C so I just, at an opportune time I got one that, that suited my needs C and I've just stuck with it. The only thing I've done to it is just add a, F uh, add a mouse and a hard drive. C And that's all I plan to do. Of course, I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line. I got the model twentyfive. C So I'm stuck with six forty, C but I'm not a power user C so it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah, D now my roomie, on the other hand, he is a power user. He's, he's looking now to get rid of his. He's got a three eightysix and wants to get a four eightysix. D You know, this kind of stuff. D Well, F um, most of the stuff up until now, in the recent months, I, I, I don't have any problem with. F Uh, E I mean it's, D you know it, No, I agree with that. As, as far as the, as far as the mess that's developing as a result, F um, D you know, as a country, the United States, F uh, I think our hands are tied as far as, as, as any further involvement, until the U N sanctions it. In fact, it really was to begin with. C And, F uh, I just, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, F uh, D you know, it, it gets to a point where, F uh, if enough people are, are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the, the internal problems, F um, somebody may step in again. C But, F uh, I really think it's, it's a U N issue, at that point because it is internal. Uhhuh. That's right, that's right. Absolutely right. Uhhuh. That's right. E I mean these, these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time. Some of them have been going on for, for tens of years, if, if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and, Yeah. That's right. Yeah, that's absolutely right. Yeah. That's, that's absolutely right. Yeah, it was just, D you know, it was, it's a very opportune moment for them to try. D You know you, F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, C and, D you know, C and it, there are many of them. There's no doubt about it. Uhhuh. D Well, C and, C and, C and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, F um, really don't have a basis in, in, F uh, politics or, or human rights or anything like that. It, It's, it's religious based C and, F uh, D you know, by, by selfproclamation this is a holy war C and it is right. C And then, F uh, we, we go on from there C and, Yeah, it, it's, it's a mess. It, it's, there's no doubt about it, C and, F uh, That's right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Absolutely. Uhhuh. You bet. You bet. D Well, yeah, C because there's no, F uh, D you know, there's, there's, there's a complete different set of values. F Um, there's, there's different value placed on human life, and, F uh, right down the list, D you know, possessions and, and everything else. C And, F uh, what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases. Okay. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. I believe it. Yeah, yeah, I can, I can, I can believe that. Yeah, I, I don't claim to have an indepth understanding by any means, C but, F uh, That's probably true, that's probably true. Uhhuh. No, no, that's, that's, F uh, a, a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field. C But, F uh, Yeah. That's right. Uhhuh, absolutely, Absolutely. That's right, yes. Right, right, that's an everyday occurrence. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I agree. Yeah, it's, it's, F uh, there, there is, there is, it's an overall problem in, in, in this country understanding, F uh, foreign cultures, or even accepting them. C And, F uh, it, it, it bites us over and over again, the, the, the, Uhhuh. That's right. That's right. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Absolutely. F Uh, D well, they're, they're coming from various places, C and a lot of them are going back there. That's <laughter>, Okay. I see. Yeah. Right. Sure, okay. Uhhuh. Absolutely. That's right. Yeah, bec, D you know, every, every, the, the country's got a problem with, F uh, with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that. C And the long, longrange views are, are just kind of, become a thing of the past. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's for sure. That's, that's the way things have gotten. Yeah. Uhhuh. No, absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uhhuh. Absolutely. That's right. That's absolutely right, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, the, the, unfortunately the way the, the way the high tech market goes, by the time you can get, get something in your hands, F um, it, it's, it's obsolete, C and, F uh we're, we, we fight that battle every day here at work, C and, F uh, Uhhuh. That's right. That's right. Okay, yeah. F Oh, okay. Yeah. D Well, that, that's, that's the key, D you know, what, whatever works for you. C And, F uh, if it does the job, then that's, that's what you need. <Laughter>. Uhhuh.
