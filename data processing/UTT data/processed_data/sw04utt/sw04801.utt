What do you think about capital punishment? Yeah. Which crimes do you feel that? Yeah. Because of, so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent selling, I think should also. Yeah <noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah that's, Go ahead. Texas is too. Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had fortysix in like the past several years. C So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess. They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville. Yeah <noise>. Yeah. <Noise> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's happening here. There is, D like, F uh, that's, in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, F uh, r, F uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again. Uhhuh. Yeah. I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. Be a little more, D you know, not being able to put it off for fifteen years. F Oh, really? Goodness. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah <<very faint>>. I, D yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient. F Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. F Uh, audiology. Yeah. What do you do? F Oh, really. Oh really? Neat. Yeah. I just, this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber <throat_clearing> in California. C So, I think it, the fortysixth in the last twentyfive years I think is what they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then. Yeah. F Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do. D Like the guy in California got thir, D you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber C and then they said D okay, no, you don't have to go. C And then they took him back. E I mean, it just seems, D Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent. C And then you have D like two, you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever D you know. No, I don't, I don't think, F uh, the military doesn't execute anymore C so. C Or death before the firing squad or whatever. C So, I think about the only one is, F uh, rape, D Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. D Well, I think first degree murder, F uh, probably warrants it. Right. Exactly. Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever. I come from a state that has, D well I originally come from the state that has, F uh, <sniffing> the death penalty. I come from Florida. C And, F uh, they're pretty liberal on it. They tend to, D like, fry people left and right. which, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I think Florida still uses electric chair. F Uh, I don't, I don't know. In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God. C And that's not, I don't think that's right. C But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it. I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it C and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. F Um, with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year. They, Uhhuh. Sure. C And it's D like, D you know, that's a big problem C but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build C and it's really, D you know, it's, it gets to be a r, a big problem. F Uh, go ahead. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. C Because a lot of these guys, D you know, they get in C and they, they get off for good behavior C and, I don't know, up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty. C And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, D you know. Because they figure D well, D you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. F Uh, C but then for, if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten. F Oh, sure, D you know. E I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails F uh, D you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. C But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, F uh, I don't know, I think that may solve a lot of that. Maybe not solve it, C but, I don't know, maybe, Yeah. Uhhuh. What do you do Georgeanne? F Oh, okay. Great. What program you in? Okay. Fantastic. F Uh I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. Yeah, I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. F Uh, yeah. C But, F uh, I don't know. It's, it's an interesting issue. There's, D like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few C and, C and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot. I can't, I, D you know, I can't give you figures C but, F uh, Uhhuh. F Oh, is that right? Okay. Yeah, I, I kind of, D yeah, I've heard things about that. I've heard that they don't mess around very much. <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Jeez, that's a lot of repeals. Uhhuh. Yeah. I don't know. I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it. F Uh, I guess, what is it, what's the policy now with treason? Do they, F uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? Yeah. Yeah.
