F Uh, not too bad really. F Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it, C but I got it anyway C and, F uh, it was a Braun C and they were real good about taking it back. It wasn't a problem at all, C so, F uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily. C But, F uh, I don't know, I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. Have you? F Um. Right <laughter>. Yeah. Right like, Exactly. I was reading, Right, I was reading something in, F uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. They were talking about cars, F uh, A the car issue just came out. And about how, D yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe C but, F uh, D you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. F Uh, D like I've got an eightysix Ford Ranger C and, C and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. D You know, C so it's like, what are you going to do, D you know? C But, F uh, that's the way it is. I don't know, I, I personally feel that, F uh, F uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, D you know, that's the way it goes C and, D you know, people, man, more than manufacturers should get a clue C and, D you know, they should start making quality products. That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. F Uh, they've got all the American, D well, all the, all the cars rated, D you know, C and, F uh, essentially, I h, I don't see much of a trend. E I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. There's nothing wrong with them. F Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. C But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy C and they're pieces of junk. Yeah, that's ninety, that's eightysix through ninetyone. C But, F uh, I don't know, may, maybe they're getting better, maybe they're starting to get a clue. F Uh, Yeah, that's just it. Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be imple, implemented until, D you know, quite a few years down the road. C But, F uh, F Oh, yeah. Yeah, because technology is so, F uh, D you know, volatile and changing all the time. F Uh, Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. It, D uh, th, they keep up c, with it pretty quickly C and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess. F Uh, I don't know. Yeah. Right, they're kind of the leaders right now, D you know. I used to see all those commercials for Windows, D you know, C and you're like, F oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. Yeah, D you know. Exactly, almost is the key word, there, too, D you know, because I, I really, I've used both C and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. F Uh, Yeah, yeah that's true, too. C But, F uh, I don't know, I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. I, I do use a Mac at work C but, F uh F uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home C but, F uh, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, you sound like you must, F uh, work in the computer business. Yeah? All right. No? D Well, that's, that's all right. Yeah, that's true. Something that I find uncomfortable is, D you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer C and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, D you know, let, let's take the example, the modem for, D you know, Okay, w, w, what baud rate do you get? D Well, D you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba, Okay, C so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? Uhhuh. I haven't had to. It's, F uh, the, every so often, E I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself. Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's C and it shrinks too much C and D say, D well, I should have known better, E I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's C and it was probably made in China by slaves. C But, F uh, they, F uh, most of the time A pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff. I think that, F uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized C and if you want to buy American <laughter>, it takes real extra work to find. It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah, really. Yeah, I think they're beginning to. The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away C and, Uhhuh. I know. Still at it, hey. Wow. D Well, they got a three year lead time. It probably won't start really showing up until ninetyfour or so <laughter>. The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. C And can you think of any other industry where in software they, if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail s,. C Or, F uh, maybe I say, D well, D you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. <Laughter>. Yeah. C And the hardware, D well, E I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity C and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. <Laughter>. Really, why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price. They'd sell more if they were honest. Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base. Uhhuh. Apple's sort of making a s, C and they're ones were growling consumer, F uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting, D like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back. They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. Yeah, I have one, I do desktop publishing at work C and I have a machine at home C and I belong to the user's group C and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. C But, F uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry. I don't work a computer company. I'm an abuser. C But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to D you know, keep up with the changes as they happen. Yeah.
