Okay Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I agree <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Ooh. <Laughter>. Right. It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise. I know what you mean. F Um, D well, I try to. F Um, I started at the beginning of this year, I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again, I'm going to be real good, C and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, F uh, aerobics classes there. C And they run for two months at a time. C And you have to, you do have to pay to take them. C And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half, C so that was four and a half hours a week. C And it cost sixty dollars, C and I thought, okay, that's not cheap, that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money. C And I had a friend of mine going, C so I was real good, I only missed it about three times. C And then, F oh, March came around, C and I signed up again, C and I got, F uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I, C and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class. C And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there. C And so that was two weeks I had missed, C and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April, C and this session is about to run out. D Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes C and some of them require me to go out of town, C and, C and, F uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that. C So. C And I've, lately, F uh, there's been nights that I could have gone C and I've found excuses, F uh <laughter> things like I had the flu last week, C but I'm fine this week. I could have gone Monday. I could have gone tonight, C and I didn't. C So, I'm kind of finding excuses, C and now it's kind of like, D well, this is the last week. I'll just start fresh next week. C But, I better <laughter>, better do it. C And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months. She started taking tennis lessons, C and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, E or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go. C So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I'm the same way. Yeah. Uhhuh. I do too. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, walking is kind of boring. I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood, C and we try to, we used to try to get together, C and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking. There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex. C And it's not as boring if you get several people C and you can kind of talk, C and, C and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly, C and the aerobics isn't too boring. I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. F Um, it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess. C But, F uh, I do, I do have to make myself go, C and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good, C and after I get finished I feel great. E I mean, I can go in there, I can be, D like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go, C and I'll have headache and everything, C and I get out, I don't have a headache any more. I feel great, C and I'm just, it's amazing how much better I feel. C And then just in general, I sleep a lot better C and I just feel much better. E I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks, C and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better. C But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising. D Well, I'm too tired, C or I have a headache C or, D well, I just got over the flu, C and I'm still kind of draggy C so I better not go <laughter>. Yeah, it really is. Right. Right. It's just hard to make yourself go. C And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night, C and I've been sweaty, C and, C and it, D you know, I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands. C So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands. C So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better. Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes <laughter>, because you've already kind of shot your night. C But, F um, C so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, F uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in. No, it's less expensive. This one was only fortyfive dollars. C But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably. Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go <laughter>. C So hopefully. Yeah, yeah, it's right there, C and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I. They've got two different aerobics rooms, they have the mirrors. Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall <laughter> you don't like to see how you work. C But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going. C But, Uhhuh. C And they have ceiling fans in the rooms, C and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. F Um, C and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work. I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it. C And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Quite a few do. They have probably, F ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running, C and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. F Uh, they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter, C and I guess guys can take advantage of that. For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again. C But there's a lot more guys that do that one. <Noise> <static> C And, F um, they have them, D you know, in the evenings, they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that. C So they have big variety. They even have some, F uh, aerobic, F uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool. I've never done that one before. C But. Uhhuh. They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball. They've got the full weight room and, F uh, the locker rooms with, F uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, D you know, everything you'd need just about. It's a real, it is a real nice facility. It's also got a full insid, inside basketball court, C and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things. C But it's, it is very nice. I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should. E I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing. C But. Yeah. You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities, C and it's about eight dollars a month. No, not at all <laughter>. Pretty cheap. C And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership, C but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard. Hm? F Oh, yeah, in fact, F uh, the T Ier's families can come in on these things, Okay, F uh, the question was about, F uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise. D Well, F uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should. I try to walk. C And, F uh, last year I would, I did it every day, C but I've kind of, in ninetyone I've kind of gone down hill. C And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to, C but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier. C But it's just to get motivated to do it, C and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I ca, I do it every night. It's just to get, F uh, motiv, motivated again, C and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again. C And I was walking, C and it got kind of dark. C And I was by myself, C and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block. C And, so I, I kind of got frightened, C and I kind of use that as an excuse. All I have to do, is start earlier, <laughter> C but. I haven't walked since, C so. Yeah, it sure is. It sure is. How about you? Do you exercise on a regular basis? Uhhuh. Oh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's once you get out of that habit you just don't, you don't get back into it. C Because I teach school, C and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class. We went in together and hired a private instructor, C and she came to our school twice a week. C And, I, I was, I would go faithfully, C and then I missed once. Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again. I think, if you, you just have to stick with it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing. D Like it's misery loves company. I don't really love exercise. E I mean, some I, the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's, C and, F uh, it's not President's any more. I don't know what the name of it is anymore. C But she loves it. E I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her. She just enjoys it so much. C And I don't. I feel good after I do it, C but I hate it when I'm doing it. D You know, I just, I don't enjoy it at all, C and she just loves it. C So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, D you know. <Noise> C And, it's a daily thing for her. C So, it, D you know, C and it's so hard for me. I envy her, I wish I could be that way, C but I don't. I don't, C and I have an older sister that loves running, too, C and she runs all the time, C but at, to me, it's every minute's agony, C and I, in fact, I don't run. I hate to run. D Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something C and that helps, D you know, pass the time. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's right. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, it's great afterwards, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Exactly it does, it gives you energy. Yeah. <Laughter>. It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it? Yeah, I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise, C and, D you know, it's silly not to, C but, I don't know, it's just a put off. I don't know why I don't do more, C and I, C and I know that it's good for my health. I know, D you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health. C So, D you know, you, not only, D you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life. C So. There's no reason that we shouldn't do it, C but I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Does it cost the same for just two nights or, D Well, that's good, too. Yeah, yeah. That's right, that's right. D Well, do you have a facility right at the, where you work? <Laughter> No. Yeah, C and then they hire private instructors? F Oh, that's great. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I can see that would be, F uh, easy. They make it as easy as they possibly can for you. D Well, F um, do a lot of people take advantage of it? F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, you have a pool there, too? F Oh, how nice. Wow. That's great. Now to use, D Well, does it cost money D like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, F uh, to tak, to go swimming. Do you have to pay for that, too. F Oh, that's not bad. Huhuh. F Um. I think so too, yeah. D Well, C and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics? <Noise> People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?
