Okay. What, F uh, go ahead and tell me about your home <laughter>. F Oh, is that right? <Laughter>. F Oh, that's interesting. Okay. Yeah. <Laughter> No, that's okay <laughter>. Okay. F Oh, that's neat. Wow, that's large <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> <noise>. F Oh, D well, that's not too bad, that's still fairly new. D Well, F Oh, you're kidding <laughter>. <Breathing> D Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there, E I mean, what it's, Okay. <Laughter>. It, it sounds like, E I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand <laughter>. E I mean, Dallas is a very marked up <breathing> area, although right now it's a lot lower <laughter>, F um, because of all the layoffs and everything <laughter> the economy around here is real poor <laughter>. D Well, no, not really <laughter>. <Breathing> F Um, the area itself, F uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, F um, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments <laughter>. F Um, there's been tremendous amounts of, of, F uh, layoffs <breathing> C so, really housing is real bad. The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad, C but housing is still real bad <breathing>. Yeah. Yeah. This is, Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. <Breathing> Wow. C So, do you think, it was overdeveloped then? Wow. F Um. F Um <lipsmack>, yeah. Yeah. <Breathing> D Well, <breathing> right now we're just renting, C but <laughter> it is a home. F Um, <Lipsmack> it's a four bedroom home <breathing>. It has about, I guess, eighteen hundred square feet <breathing>. It's on one floor <breathing>. F Uh, we have no basement <laughter>. I don't know, Okay <laughter>. I wasn't sure. Most of the ones, F you know, up north and everything do, <laughter> C but, F um, anyway, <lipsmack> it's, F uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area. Most of this area was developed, this house was built in seventyfour. <Breathing> C So most of the, it's almost twenty years old, C and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style <breathing>. F Uh, we have a friend that lives two blocks over, <breathing> C and his house is almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four C but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. C So I, I think most of them are <breathing> there was, it, D like most areas that are built, <breathing> F um, there were probably, D like two or three styles you could choose from <laughter>. C And, C and, F uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, <laughter> for probably a square mile, I'd say, at least, <breathing> maybe even a little bit more than that. <Breathing> Where are you in relation to Sevren? are you close to Sevren? Okay. D Well, I just, I have a sister that used to live in Sevren. C And they bought their home <breathing> in <breathing> I, I want to say like around nineteen seventyfive or something like that, C and they paid like, they, they had it built from, D you know, they, they designed it and everything, <breathing> C and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it, C and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand <laughter>. Yeah, C so I just wondered, D you know, if the whole area was like that <laughter> or, Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. Sounds like a lot of money though <laughter>, sure. Yeah. Right. F Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah. <Breathing>. Wow <laughter>. Wow, that's, <Laughter>. Really? That much of a difference? Wow. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Wow. Why is that? Do you know? E I mean <lipsmack>, Uhhuh <noise>. Oh. Oh <laughter>. <Breathing> <noise>. <Breathing> My goodness <laughter>. Wow <laughter>. <Breathing> D Well, my home at the moment is an apartment. Yeah <laughter>. I work here in Germantown, C but I live in Pensacola, Florida. D So, I own a home in Pensacola, C and, F uh, let's see, we are to compare homes. Correct? F Uh, <breathing> my home is, <breathing> D well, is typical for the area. I live in a development, <breathing> F uh, it's a relatively, I would say, D well, God, it sounds like, <laughter> sounds like I'm bragging <laughter>. C But it's upper middle class, F uh, kind of an environment. It's a <breathing> two story colonial, which my wife and I designed. F Uh, it has around thirtytwo hundred square feet. <Laughter> F Uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on, <breathing> C and it is, I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. It might be, <breathing> I would say it's probably midsized for the area. There are some smaller, C and there are, s, D you know, several larger. C And, F uh, C but based, D you know, in terms of, D you know, in, in Pensacola, in that area of Florida <lipsmack> it, F uh, <breathing> it's what now, it is, F uh, <breathing> probably <breathing> ten years old. Yeah. C And so it's, <breathing> in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, F uh, <breathing> the hou, D you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, F uh, compared to other parts of the country, D you know, let's say compared to Maryland <breathing>, that same house here would probably cost threequarters of a million dollars <laughter> C but, <Laughter>. I really haven't, I really haven't, F uh, <breathing> when we built it ten years ago, it was, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars. <Breathing> C So, I, I would have really, I haven't really priced, D you know, in the market, C so I, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I thought that was on the upswing again now. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh <breathing>. D Well, Pensacola has <breathing> it's really is a buyer's market there now <breathing>. C And it isn't because of the, D well, there has been a lot of speculative building. F Uh, A I don't know, perhaps not in Dallas, C but, F uh, I'm sure people in, F uh, D you know, in, F uh, Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it, F uh, Pensacola is a Navy town. C And home porting was a possibility a few years ago. They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy, a new carrier was coming in and, F uh, the, F uh, attendant, F uh, support vessels. D Well, that's no longer, <Breathing> the case. F Oh, it's, it is. E I mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population. C And so i, overbuilding is, i, has been a real problem there. C So you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price. C And E I mean <breathing> good, I would, let's say typical, <lipsmack> say three bedroom, F uh, two and a half baths, <breathing> on a half acre or so of land <breathing>, F uh, <<pause>> reasonable construction would probably run you, F uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. And probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood. What about your home? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Nor do we, C but, <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. <Breathing> D Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in, in the entire D C area. I'm, <breathing> I'm only about, F uh, twelve miles or so from the, F uh, border of Washington D C, <breathing> and Montgomery County, Maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to, <Breathing> No, we are west. Sevren is east, near the eastern shore, if I had, Uhhuh. F Oh, that's not unusual, yeah. <Cough>. D Well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in the, the immediate, D you know, Washington area. C And so, we, F uh, I was just looking, for example there is a, F uh, condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live, C and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. C And <breathing> ninetytwo thousand dollars for a two bedroom, which is essentially a two bedroom apartment. D Now, it was very nicely done. I would have thought, Yes. I, I can't, I can't envision spending that much money, and <breathing> on, on something along those lines. C So, D you know, it's, y, I guess you pay the piper C but, C Plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally, high. F Uh, for the, C and so, you, on that <breathing>, it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, D you know, what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house <breathing> say, for example, in Pensacola, Florida, on that house <breathing> with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. May, maybe, D you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now, <breathing> C but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it. <Laughter>. C So, it's, F uh, C so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive <breathing> twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, F uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, C but the taxes would be, D you know, <breathing> perhaps, maybe onethird F uh, of, F Oh, absolutely. Yeah, C so, it's, it's really sad <laughter>. This is one, this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country. <Breathing> D Well, they <breathing>, it, <<pause>> the, their, they do have an extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example. It has one of the best school systems in the country. F Uh, C and C because the cost of living around here is so high, public employees make great salaries around here <laughter>. I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the, Montgomery County Public Schools makes, C a, C an, C and I'm not, this is, F uh, the figure, he makes eighty thousand dollars a year. That's, C and I, by administrator I, I think I mean, I, they didn't, they did not define it, C but <breathing> for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or <breathing> someone, D you know, in that, F uh, in that range.
