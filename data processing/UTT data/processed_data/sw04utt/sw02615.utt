I don't know what the, the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is, is change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff. I haven't gotten really involved in anything, F uh, extensive in car repairs in, F oh, F oh, probably a year or so. I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, or fuel injected, C and so there's, Yeah. No there's no way. Somebody once said, F uh, I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it C and a woman asked me what that meant C and I said that means that I can't work on it. D You know, they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that, F uh, the guys, average guys can't really go out in the, in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs, F uh. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I used to have, F uh, ch, Chevy van, it was a short van, that had the, the three fifty in it. C And basically it, it was a motor C and you didn't have all the other junk around it, C and you could get to it to work on it. Yeah, the hardest part about, F uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it. D Well that's kind of the way I was, I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went, C and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel. D Well that's true. I think the onl, closest thing I've come to, to a diesel is, I've worked for a tractor repair shop, F uh, when I was in high school C and, F uh, we used to overhaul farm tractors basically, C and they were nearly all, all diesel, C but as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them. D Well, ye, yeah, C and you ca, you can get to them. D Well I, Yeah. I'm, I guess you're right the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status. I don't know exactly why. One of the reasons is I, I'm beginning to wonder is, where do you get gas at. I su, I don't know if it's still, F uh, limited like it was, I don't notice it, probably because I don, F Huh? Yeah, I don't, I don't notice C but maybe because I'm not looking for it. Yeah. C But yo, you got the, the three fifty in the van? Yeah, that's what I like because, they've got plenty of power, C and, F uh, if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be. I'm convinced that, F uh, Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes. I'm convinced that the small V eight like the, the Mustang's original two eightynine or some of the Chevy two eightythrees, were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers C but they had enough power t, pull all this weight. C And the four cylinders just don't have it. Yeah. I think those gu, those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it, C but. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's kind of like, the, the first, D well my first car was a fiftysix Mustang C and, F uh, over the years, F uh, all I had a, F uh, Dodge pickup several years ago, C and, F uh, I can't remember the size of the engine it was a three F oh, seven or something like that, C but, F uh, I remember working on those cars, you'd open the hood C and there was basically nothing in there but an engine, and a few things. Now, you open the hood and it's scary. Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes. Yeah. Yeah. D Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to. My dad's got a new, F um, I guess it's an eightynine or ninety, F uh, Chrysler something or other. It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes, front wheel drive. C And, F uh, he was showing it to me C and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean C and, D you know, you can see the three spark plugs there in the front. C And I said D well where are the other three. C And he'd never really thought about it. C And he says D well, hopefully I won't have to change them, before I trade it off. Yeah, it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall. C So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah the antismog pumps. C And all that stuff loads the motor down. C So it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things. C But that's one good thing I've got a, F uh, eight ninety, F uh, Chevy Blazer now C and it's got one, F uh, belt on it a serpentine belt. Yeah. I haven't had to replace the thing yet. It looks like it would be, F uh, better than having, I've got an, an Olds Toronado that, I think's got six belts on the sucker. C And I had to get all those off, D you know, when I was replace that, F uh, water pump. C And, F uh, I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where. F Oh man. You bet, everything else's got to come off first. D Well, it's a pleasure meeting you. F Uh, I've got, F uh, five stickers here from T I, C so I guess I've done probably, F uh, I'd say seven or eight of them. Yeah, I haven't gotten any calls in two weeks, C so I don't know, if, if it's tapering off, or what. I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting, F uh, answers. C So it sounds, it's taken them ten, fifteen minutes at a time, C so, people are either not, no, maybe they're burnt out or, yeah. D Anyway let you go. Thanks for talking. Yeah, I had a similar thing, that I've worked on cars ever since I was, F uh, a kid <laughter>. C And that was some time ago, C but I've gotten to the point where, F uh, the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that, F uh, F oh, most of the cars I buy, I try to buy as simple a car as possible. C So, D you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs C and most of them now, D you know, you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or, or fuel injected C so there goes the carburetor C and if the fuel injection system breaks down, there's no way in the world you're going to work on that. F Oh, yeah, yeah, basically that's it. Yeah, I've got, F uh, an eightyfour Chevy van that's, F uh, a one ton van with a camper conversion on it. It's got the, the, the good old three fifty, standard engine in it. Regular gas engine, C and that engine I understand, I can, wo, I can actually work on that engine. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I had to change the water pump in that, here about a year ago. C And it was really fairly easy. Take the grill out and the radiator out C and you can just stand there and work on it. D Well that's true <laughter>. You're right, D you know, by the time you've finally got down to it, I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went. A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel C and, F uh, the, F uh, it, after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it. C And, F uh, I bought it when we were living in Lubbock, when I came back here, I brought the car back here C and, F uh, I don't know, diesels got pretty unpopular C and you couldn't sell the thi, E I mean, though for what you could get for one, you might as well drive it over a cliff. C And, F uh, the injector pump went bad C so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it. And, F uh, i, reinstalled that C and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time. F Oh, D well, it, D you know, i, diesels don't require mechanics, they require plumbers. C And, F uh, <laughter>. Yeah. D Well the injector nozzle and stuff in, D you know, the big diesel farm tractors, D you know, D what are about the size of your thumb, C and the, yeah you can get to them, C and the ones in, in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with. I've had a lot of good service out of that car, C but, F uh, F uh, I finally gave it to my son C and he drove it literally into the ground, D you know <laughter>. He was out at Tech C and he, he finished it off. What, the availability? You mean the diesel availability? Yeah, D well I'd bought, F uh, a G M C diesel pickup and, F uh, loved that thing, D you know, I really liked it. C But it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed, C and it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, D you know, traded it in on the Chevy van. C But, F uh, sure enjoyed it. Yeah, yeah the three fifty regular gas engine. Uhhuh. Yeah co, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I think that little, the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty, in fiftyfive, I think was two sixtyfive, something like that. Little, D you know, not whole lot more than the, than the, than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirtyfive or so. C But, F uh, <laughter> they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred, small block four hundred that was, F uh, the same block, D you know, just, just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more, an. D Well that was, F uh, that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up. The two little cars I've got now, bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple of years ago C and, C and it was normally carbureted C and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong, and D you know changing the plugs and stuff. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. The friend of ours over here, he's got, F uh, sixtyfive, or sixtysix Mustang the six cylinder. C And, F uh, I was look under the hood of that the other day C and like you say, you can see the road. It's amazing. You coul, D yeah, you could stand in there if you really wanted to, I guess. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well when they went to the, started with the newer engines, D you know, when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much, D you know, trouble. Because the three fifty with all the, D you know, D like D well, actually, I guess, her, within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it. The three oh five was that, that, V eight that they put in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van. C And it had all the air pump and, F uh, F uh, A I don't know, all that, all that stuff. C And all the antismog stuff. C And, F uh, boy that was, F uh, really a mess back under there under the, in that van. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, it's that one that's about, F uh, what an inch and a half wide. Got a bunch of groves in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck. D You know, when one of them breaks, it's not the outside one, it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering be, C or something that's way back in there. Everything's got to come off. Yeah, C and we'll, F uh, how many times have you done this now? Is this, Yeah, I hadn't, F uh, hadn't, not gotten any calls here in the last, F uh, this is the first one in a week or so. If ta, it's winding down or what. Finding a taker. Yeah, D well. Okay, all right. Byebye.
