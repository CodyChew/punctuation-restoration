Okay, yeah, Donna, F um, you said you have three children. What, F uh, kinds of activities do you spend with them? Is it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <<Faint>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C So do you find it difficult to find time, C or is it pretty natural? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Do you work during the day? <<Faint>> Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I can imagine. Yeah. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D So what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general, D you know, in America? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh <<faint>>. F Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah, D well, families are facing a challenge, I know that with, I'm a newlywed C and we're D you know, thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years C and, Yeah. <<Faint>> Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Yeah. Okay, F um, we have an eleven year old, an eight year old, and a three year old C and, F um, <Sniffing> F uh, my husband, A let's see, he coaches basketball with Brian, F um, C so he spends time doing that with him, planning and, F um, practicing outside. F Um, he's a real sports kind of person, C so he plays tennis with, with the kids. We all kind of play tennis as a family, C except the baby plays in the playground. We take turns with her. F Um, <lipsmack> F uh, let's see, we have a computer C and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer. F Um, <lipsmack> F uh, let's what else we do. F Oh, C plus we watch a little T V together. We really don't watch, I think, as much T V as a lot of people. We don't have H B O. We do get the Disney channel for the kids. F Uh, my kids have a Nintendo which they play, C and my husband sometimes joins them with that. F Uh, my little girl, Jennifer, likes to do crafty things, C and I'll take some time and do that with her. C And, of course, we always read a bedtime story at night, C and even the, the older kids sometimes sit down and, and will join in and listen to a story. I'm, basically the story person because my husband doesn't have, he gets home from work late or whatever C and, C and usually, once in a while he'll read the story to little one, C but that's basically my job <breathing>. F Um <talking>, It is. It is hard because, D you know, at the end of your day you want time for yourself C and, C and it, C and that's kind of cutting into your, your time. C And with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late, C but, D you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine. They go upstairs at nine, C and, F um, now, this weekend we'll have a babysitter come C and, F uh, my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home and, F um, probably not too late. Maybe Brian will still be up, and spend some time with him. C But <lipsmack> it, it's really hard. You have to be a very unselfish person to, to spend a lot of time with your kids, I think. F Uh, no, I don't work. I, last year, F um, I had a little part time job in a private, F um, high school, tutoring, F um, high school students with learning disabilities. That was two days a week, C and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot. I don't know how, I admire, people that, that can do it all, C but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept, it is hard. F Um. Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything. C And that's another thing, I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping, F um, usually on the weekend, C and that's kind of D like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son, C and they'll be my helper, C and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out C so, I try to do things like that, C but it, D you know, it's, it's, F uh, C And then, of course, they have a pretty, F um, busy social calendar too <laughter>. You fit it in with all that, that. I, I think a lot of people, a lot of people s, set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and, and, kind of leave them to their own means. F Um, I think, D you know, it's very, very easy to fall into that trap, C and I'm not, F um, <music> totally innocent of that because, there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape. C But, F um, F um, I think different parts of the country, I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids. People are, real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids, sports activities and, D You know, C but, F um, <Lipsmack>. What, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And it's, it's very hard, because when you get used to two salaries, it's very hard to, to cut back to one. C And, F um, F um, C but, D you know, if you have the type of job, I have a friend that's a nurse C and she can pick her hours C and that's a, a great career. I wish I would have gone <clicking> into, F uh, nursing <breathing>. C because she has such a flexible schedule, C but it's very hard to, F uh, spend time with the children and, F uh, and your husband and do everything at once. D Well, I think it's a big, it's a big, F um, responsibility. You just don't, have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single. When you have children, you have to say, now, this is different C and you do have to give things up. I, I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child, F um, for the, at least for the first two years of their lives. E I mean, if you, can possibly swing it C because they,
