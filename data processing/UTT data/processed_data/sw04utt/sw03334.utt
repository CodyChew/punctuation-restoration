D Well, what do you know about Latin American policies? Uhhuh. F Huh. Are you, F uh, relating this, F uh, to the, F uh, affair we've got going on in Haiti right now? Right. That, that's just it. Right, I guess my concern, <child_talking> D you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take <child_talking>, we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, F uh, antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term, C and, F uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody, C but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance. Right. Right. That's true. Sure. <Laughter>. Yep, that's about the lump sum of it. D Well, F um, I was speaking with a, a woman from, I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there, no, she was from El Salvador C and, F uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family, C and when, F uh, the Contras came into power, of course with, F uh, F oh, gosh darn, what's his face, he's in, in Florida jail now, Marcos F uh, no, he's, Marcos is Philippines, D Well, you know who I'm talking about. Yeah, I, I know it, F uh, anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, D you know, just assigned it to himself. Right right, C and, F uh, C so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect, C and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance F uh, because they were a democracy turned, F uh yeah, right basically a dictator fascist. Sure. D Well, what do you think of, F uh, this, F uh, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, Mexico, they're, I know they're trying, they're really trying, the Mexican government is trying, C and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, <breathing> F oh, make themselves Americanized, I guess and, F uh, which is great because that's what they basically need to do. The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule D you know, C and we don't have the Siesta, C and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, F uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of life, C and we've had our way of life, C and, F uh, <Breathing> D Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent, really. F Uh, I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations D you know. We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support. That, and, D you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, F uh, countries like that that depend on us so much without, D you know, just telling them, running their country for them C but, It's got to be tough, C but, E I mean, F uh, F uh, you sure, you still have to, D you know, let them know how you feel. Yeah, it worries me that, F uh, the economy of so many countries in, in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people, like the, D you know, like cocaine from Columbia, C and F uh, <breathing>, D you know, of course I, I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us, C but C but that is, that's a tough deal, C and it, I don't think that, maybe I, maybe it's, D you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it, C but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions <laughter> in lot of those countries C and E I mean, they've been hammering, for the last, you know, ten centuries, C and it's still going on, C and, F uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how, some times, Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, F um, D well, I'm blank <laughter> on it. I can see his face forget his name <laughter>. Yeah, kind of nationalized it for himself, Yeah. Dictator, Yeah. C And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing, it just D you know, unstable. D Well, I think it's long overdue F uh, I just, D you know, there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, I'm not, D you know, I have a problem, F uh, with whether it's going to work or not, D you know, there's, F uh, it seems like there's, C and I, this may be unfair to Mexico, C but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times. Yeah. Yeah yeah. I think their, their version of the good old boy network going that, F uh, D you know, has a lot,
