Okay, I've never been to Tempe. That's where I'd like to go. What do you like about Tempe? Pretty hot isn't it, in the summer? That's good. Uhhuh. Been to Hawaii? <Breathing> Yes, in fact, I just got some reservations. I'm going to go for, F uh, almost two weeks this winter. Yes. It's the longest, D well actually I lived there, C so I was there longer, C but two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there, C so I'm kind of looking forward to that one. F Uh, no, in March. We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way. Yeah, C so I think, I would like to go to Arizona. E I mean, I was in Phoenix in January, last January C but it was rainy and icky. It was the coldest it's been there ever in January <breathing>, I think. It's very cold. C But, I would like to go to Tempe. Do we travel a lot? F Uh, some, yeah. D Well, I've been a, I was a travel agent. E I mean, I have been up until just a few months ago.

My husband hasn't been to Europe yet C and I'd like to take him there. C And, C but he's traveled all over the United States C and I haven't. D Like, I haven't been down south. I'd like to go to New Orleans. Have you been there? We, I live in Yakima, Washington. C So it's cold and rainy today. It's yucky. C But we've had some pretty nice weather. We played tennis outdoors until last week, C so that's a pretty good deal. D So do you go to school in Provo, Utah? Do you use NuSkin skin care. They're located in Provo. Do you? I'm a NuSkin person. Yeah, I sell NuSkin, too. I, I am my only b, and best cus, not only and best C but I'm my best customer. Since we're not supposed to talk about this, though, is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream? Do you know? I have that, too. I'm fortytwo, I need something, I need more. Yeah. I didn't know if there was anything else. C And I use the Celltrex. C But D anyway, D well, yes, NuSkin is wonderful. I think it's a wonderful product. Do you use it? F Oh, my gosh. That's great. Yeah, F oh, yeah. That's good. Are they good to work for? That's great. D Anyway, C so we're supposed to be talking about places to go C and you have not been to Europe. Do you go to school? Do you ski? Ski, you probably ski very well in Utah. F Uh. Why did you move to Utah? You're going, F oh, you are going to school? At B Y U, is that where B Y U is? Okay, I know some people that went to B Y U. That's great. Pretty good. Pretty, pretty down there. F Huh? C So, where, have you skied? Sure. Sure, D so you're a sophomore. Or junior? You're a junior. Good for you. What are you studying? Good for you. You sound like a girl that has it together. I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get married. Because when you get married, you won't have the money or the time. C So just, D you know, don't, don't be in any hurry. You really should go to Europe. I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college C and that was just, I, E I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car C and I took the trip. C And F uh, I traveled with a group of sixteen other students. Actually they, there was two other graduating seniors besides myself, C and we just had a ball. We stayed at, F Uh, six weeks. Yeah. It was wonderful, C so you should think about doing something like that.
