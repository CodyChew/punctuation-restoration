<Beep> Okay, F uh, have you, did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie? F Oh, where are you from? In Germany. D Well, D Now there's a place I'd like to visit <laughter>. F Oh, that's neat. Uhhuh. My hus, my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe, E or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war C and so we've seen lots of pictures of the, of the beautiful, spots and, areas, y, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's neat, neat <breathing>. What kind of vacations do you like? F Oh. H, Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. When, when our children were younger, we enjoyed, we lived up in, F uh, New York, E or New Jersey and, and used to like, F uh, traveling into upstate New York and camping C and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and, that sort of thing, C but we've never really, F uh, did any diving or anything. Little bit of s, of, F uh, F uh, <lipsmack>, F oh, s, water skiing. C But, not much of, F uh, of anything else. F Uh, Uhhuh. It's got to be the water. Right. When, when we were in Jersey, we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot, and really enjoyed that a lot. It's really, they had, a really nice beach areas there. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. That's a really pretty area, too. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, we loved the, we loved the, the New Jersey area, too, because the <breathing> the lakes were really pretty close, D you know, you could, you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour <breathing> and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and, and just really, C and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail, we did quite a bit of hiking, which is kind of fun. Are you a, you a hiker, or not? Not so much, F huh? Uhhuh. C So your, your next, your plans are try to find someplace to s, scuba dive. You have any children? Okay, then that's probably one of the reasons our, we had little children all the time, C so some of the things are not as, quite as, F uh, adaptable. Yeah, it is. You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too, C and, C so, I think, wha, Yeah. Eleven or twelve, I would think, probably C but, maybe fifteen even. I know that, F uh, F uh, one of, one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family. D You know, we go wherever somebody is, that we haven't seen for a while <laughter>. C So that, that's kind of, F uh, we just came back from, F uh, F uh, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate, from, F uh, with his Master's Degree in social work C and so that was fun, C and, C and the summer we have a, we have a, a reunion in, in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather large reunion group that, F uh, as we can get together C so, Ye, Yeah. F Um. We, we've tra, we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country. I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe, D you know, like a, a small camper. We've, we've travelled in a big one. I hate them <laughter> because they're hard to jockey around, D you know, C but maybe a pickup with the back on, Yeah. C So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes, C but you wouldn't want to do it all the time. F Uh, we have enough friends here and there, I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know, and visit for a day and then go on and, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think that would real, C and I would like to maybe not take great long trips, but, but have your home base, where your home is and then just travel out for, D like, maybe, F oh, a month, maybe go, C And, Yeah. Yeah. There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America, that's for sure. We've, I haven't been much to the south, I haven't been in, in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama. I guess that's, those are the only states I have not visited. C But, F uh, up the coast, F uh, at, F uh, F uh, in Maryland and around there, where the, where the early history is, there's some Johnstown and, F uh, in s, in that area is just really neat, interesting things to C so, D you know. D so, Yeah, we took a trip, F uh, around to the, F uh, Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something, I believe it was. F Uh, had about three kids then I think, C but that was a really fun, interesting trip. I <breathing> we, we read Bruce book before we went, D you know, C and, so we were ready to look up the places we read about. It was really interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, D now, camping is fun with kids. If you're, D you know, once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones, C but, even, even some little ones do pretty good C but, C but when they get a little bigger so they can help, that, that's a fun way to <breathing>, to, F uh, cut costs C and it's enjoyable, too. Very restful. E I mean I find, Yeah, I find the outdoors very relaxing and, D you know, kind of <breathing> a change. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, I'm with you. I need my creature comforts, too. D Well, it was great to talk to you. Okay, see you later. Byebye. F Uh, no I've only been here for the last ten years, F uh, I grew up most of my childhood in Germany. F Uh, C and, we, we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance. C So we, we travelled all over Europe. When I was, when I was very young. Unfortunately, a, a little bit too young to really appreciate. F Uh, I was grade school age. F Uh, F Um. That, that would be a, to me, a really nice vacation because I'm, I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, F uh, I, I sure would work on it <laughter>, if I had an opportunity like that. F Uh, D well my husband and I are scuba divers. C So, we both like to go to dive resorts. F Uh, we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon, C and we dove there. F Uh, C but, we, we did about six dives while we were there. C And, F uh, we were originally planning on going to Cayman, F uh, last year F uh, C but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip. We had to have, D like, eleven people for, this package, F uh, deal. F Uh, C and we couldn't get enough people together, F uh, to go, C so it ended up falling a, falling through. We were going to get a really good price. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Snorkeling? F Oh, really. F Um. D Well, my husband and I both like water, C so any, any vacation that we go on is usually, involves, close to the ocean, or, or something like that. Yeah, we, After we moved away from Germany, we moved to New Hampshire. C And I lived there for seven years. F Uh, C and I really enjoyed that because, D you know, the mountains were real close, we like the, we like the white mountains C and, F Uh, unfortunately, I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there. I went skiing once. Uhhuh. F Uh, Not, not really so much. If, if, if there was some place that, that we went to where there was hiking involved, I, I would be D you know, happy to go hiking, C but <breathing> we, we never have really planned a vacation around, F uh, places to go hiking. Yeah. Our next vacation will, will be scuba diving, I'm sure. No, not yet. Yeah. Yeah, it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation, when you have, have children. Yeah. Yeah, C and diving is something that, especially for small children, F uh, I think the, the minimum age for diving is, is probably, legal anyway, would be probably about sixteen. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. That, that sounds like a lot of fun. Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too, that there were several hundred, F uh, people C and they all kind of met at a central place. I, I didn't go, F uh, C but it would have been nice. It would have been a nice vacation. Uhhuh. Some, C or something like, F uh, what's the, like the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice. Yeah. Uhhuh. My dad has been talking for years about, F uh, getting a fifth wheel and just picking up, he's retired F uh, he's in his sixties, C and he, F uh, would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there, and just, D you know, not, be settled anywhere, just see, see the rest of the country. Uhhuh. He, he does that quite a bit. He, he hasn't lately, though, F uh, because he's been ill, F uh, C but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time C and, D you know, he'll say, this is my itinerary. I'm going here, here and here C and I'll be back in about two months <laughter>. Uhhuh. Have you been a, to a lot of the different historical sites? Uhhuh. Yeah, I I think right, right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and, and adventurous types of things, C and then when we, eventually, when we have kids, D Now, his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country. D You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, I do enjoy camping. As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine <laughter>. And electricity. Yeah. It was nice talking to you, too, Beth. Okay. Byebye.
