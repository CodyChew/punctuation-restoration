<Breathing> D Well, th, the question was talking about the juries C and, F uh, one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, F uh, maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. F Uh, C so that, F uh, a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person to, F uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. <Buzz> <noise>. <Child_talking>. Right. Right <<very faint>>. <Child_talking> Uhhuh. Yeah. D See I agree with you. F Uh, one thing I heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court. E I mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything. F Uh, you go C and you present your case, the other side presents their case C and you're done with it. It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. F Uh, C and, F uh, C but it's not that we have, F uh, such, it didn't backlog or all of the, F uh, the cases that are, F uh, all ready pending. F Uh, C so I, that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. <Buzz>. Yes. Yes. Now, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. <Breathing>. F Oh, yes C and, C and I wasn't, I didn't mean that <laughter>. I, I didn't mean that, no. C Because, E I mean, gee whiz, if I was, F uh, F uh, didn't have that right, D you know, not to have a jury that, F oh yes, I would feel, F uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated. C But I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here. We're not going to have a jury, D you know, let's get it over with. Sort of like car accidents, D you know, Yeah. <Buzz>. <Buzz>. Right, right <child_talking>. Uhhuh. Right. Giving a different sentence. Uhhuh. The take. Right. D Well, I, I, i, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. Uhhuh. <Noise>. <Talking>. <Buzz>. <Buzz>. Right. Right. <Child_talking>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah, C bu, D well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries <laughter>, judges chambers or anything like that <laughter>. N, D well I was called once when I was nineteen C and, F uh, C but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me C and, I was doing school and things like they, they let me out. C An, I've never had to it since C and that was almost twenty years ago <laughter>. <Buzz>. Uhhuh. <Child_talking>. Uhhuh. F Huh. How interesting. Uhhuh, Uhhuh <breathing>. Right. I, I kind of agree with that, because I think in some cases, F uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed. F Uh, I, I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case C so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal <laughter> there C and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri, position to give an appropriate, F uh, sentencing. Uhhuh. In other words, not, not, there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? I, I, I don't, th, there's a point on which we don't agree. I would tend, myself, to say that <sigh> we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime a, one of the parties wants one. C And I, usually it is the defendant, I guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case. C So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, F uh, take that, D you know, that would require a change in the Bill of Rights, I believe C and so, F Oh, F oh, okay. Right. D Well I think that's all ready possible. I think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial F uh, yeah C so. I agree that that should be encouraged. People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. C But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, D you know, tweak a jury into <laughter> per, giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, F uh, D you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award. Yeah. C And I suspect it, in cases like, I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil. Is that right? Yeah. D Well, F uh, in the case of, civil, F uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage C and I think that may be where jury use is overdone, E I mean there are cases where they could be settled, maybe out of court a little more efficiently. C But the lawyers are really, F uh, it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience <laughter>, as possible C so. F Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases. F Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. C But I am in favor of it for criminal cases C so there's a difference of my view there for those two. <Laughter> Have you ever had to serve jury duty? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It isn't, sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, F uh, that would have been about, F uh, twenty years too F uh, F uh, just last year C and, F uh, the case I heard was a criminal case C and it seemed it really, trivial. It involved two bicycles. We didn't do the sentencing. The judge did. D So we, we a, rendered a verdict C and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. <Swallowing> <lipsmack> C And that was here in Wisconsin. C So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,
