Okay, Bill, right? Okay, Bill, have you done much camping? Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, that, that sounds good. Yeah, you do. F Um, D now do you have a lot mountains, D well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you. Where do you find places to camp? Oh. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Oh. F Oh, my word. D Well that sounds adventuresome <laughter>. D Well, F um, I've done, F oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I. F Um, we have five children, C and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves. C So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out, C and we have gone up into the mountains and, F uh, not necessarily roughed it, C but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains. C And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now, they're twelve and eleven, C and so, they're involved in the scouting C and they do a lot of camping with the scouts <Throat_clearing> C and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week, C and so this year they'll both be going, C and so that's been real enjoyable for them. D So. F Um, yes, they've, D well, no, actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the du, the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire, C and I don't think they've taken the stoves. F Um, last year they camped in tents, C and this year I believe they will be in tents also. Uhhuh, yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, is that right? F Oh, C and what does that consist of? Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Yes, D well, D see, when, when we go camping here, we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and <laughter> lots of tents C and, I like to sleep on the air matresses. I'm not, <laughter> my bones are getting so old, C so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses. F Um, C so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that? Oh. My word. Gee. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. Oh. Oh. F Uh, they're covered D like with a heavy armor type stuff, uhhuh. My word. <Laughter> Uhhuh <laughter>. C But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word <laughter>. D Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears. We, we want to, Yes. F Uh, yes. I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts. C And I camp, F uh, every month, F uh, camp at least one weekend C and during the summer we camp, F uh, two or three weeks a year <laughter>. I'd say I camp quite a bit. D Well, F uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping C and we, F uh, we also, F uh, carry all our equipment with us C and so we canoe down the river and then, sleep on the river on one of the, F um, sand bars and then get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again. <Laughter> How about yourself? D Well, that's good. Uhhuh. Great. What, F uh, what kind of camping do they like best? Do they like it where they have tents C and, F uh, do they cook on stoves? Uhhuh. Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah. It doesn't get very cold in Texas, C so lots of times we don't even take tents. We just use trail tarps. F Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, F uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent F uh, like a, F uh, they're very light weight C and we use them when we go backpacking. C So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, F uh, they're not very heavy, D see C so you carry them with you, C and they'll keep you dry or whatever. Uhhuh. Ye, yes, in fact, F uh, F um, last month we went camping, we saw a lot of deer F uh, in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere. Uhhuh, C so, F uh, C but, it, even though, F uh, it wasn't hunting season, C and we were with Boy Scouts, C so of course we don't, F uh, want to go hunting. C But we got to see a lot of deer F um, out and about C and there's, of course, we see smaller animals all the time, C and, F uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, F uh, is, F uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because, F uh, we have, F uh, armadillos. Do you know what armadillo is? Uhhuh. And possums, and, F uh, raccoons. C And we have those creatures down here that they like to, F uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack. C And so that, that, F uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away. They will if you attack them. C But most time they run away from you if they, if they see you're up, D you know <Sniffing> C but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep. D So.
