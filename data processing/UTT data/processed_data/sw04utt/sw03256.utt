D Well I did hear the end of the prompt this time. Was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt? C And it said that what, what do we, do we think that cri, certain crimes should fit certain punishments, C and, F uh, I was thinking about it after I got off the phone, that, that I really, D you know, wish that there was some way to, F uh, send a message to people, D you know, about, F um, child abuse and things like that that, F uh, those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment. Too often I feel that people get off, F uh, without, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, right, Yeah, Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, sometimes they even wonder when, when, F uh, criminals plead temporary insanity for, for punish, for crimes that are so severe and then, D you know, they get sent to a mental institution C and they play loony for a while, C and then they're back out in public. Yeah. Yeah, F oh, I agree, I agree, C because we, <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, D well, C and too, D you know, they can always be blaming the other person, D well, she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child, or something, which I think is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse. I guess, D you know, a lot of, C and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved C and, Is that the new, I just happened to see the headline on it, C and I didn't, couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what, C but I thought, F uh, D you know, if these things, if children are being abused, I, I'm wondering how our school system is failing, that they're not even seeing this, D you know, if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults, that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way, that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger, C and that kind of, that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, D you know, to, to deal with that yet, C but still. Never C and I lived in California which I feel like California, D you know, anything can go on in California. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I really would have no idea. I, F um, I don't, don't really know. Uhhuh that would be pretty lenient in my opinion. Yeah, that's, that, C or D like when, F uh, I've heard when I, Yes, Yes, Uhhuh. <Inhaling>. Yeah, I, I agree with you, although I will say, I'm not sure, D you know, I sometimes have a problem with some of the, especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have, D you know, was, was because they were abused a, abused as children. C And the parents are saying, Hey, wait a minute, we didn't do anything like that D you know, C and, C and, C and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it <noise> it has to be a, an absolute certainty D you know, like, F uh, <breathing> caught at it, or something D you know, C or if they, they, F uh, D you know, severely beat up on a child, or, D you know, I would have absolutely no problem at all D you know, with, with, I don't buy the routine, F oh they're just sick, C or they were abused when they were little D well, D you know, forget that. Uhhuh. D Well, C but I can't see that either. I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag, F uh, D you know reason to not use capital punishment. I think, F uh, <noise> I think if I wanted to badly enough, I could convince somebody, F uh, I was crazy <laughter>, C so, my family may say that on occasion, who knows <laughter>, D you know, F uh, I, I don't think it's that hard to do D you know, to, to convince somebody that, F uh, Gee, you just had no control over what you were doing, Uhhuh. Uhhuh, That's the new one. D Well, you, you're right, F uh, C and yet, E I mean, did you ever in your life when you were little know <laughter> anybody or hear anything of anything like this? No, <laughter>. Ye, D well, yes, I, C but I was from conservative Wisconsin <laughter>, C and, F uh, D you know, there was, there was, nothing on it, which makes me wonder, D you know, if it's as, F uh, prevalent as, as some of them claim. It, F uh, it, it, it's, you just don't know, C and it all, unless they're caught in the act or the, the, the child is very badly, D you know, beaten up, it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing. D Now, Texas, is capital punishment for, it used to be just capital murder, C and now the, they added mass murder. Are those the only two things that we, F uh F uh, D you know, C because I have a feeling it is, C and I, I think there ought to be more things added to it. F Uh, <Breathing> Yeah, I, I think that's, I, D you know, F uh, killing a child, or kidnapping, F uh, C and possibly not, D well, I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt, D you know, if they release them two hours later, he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty,
