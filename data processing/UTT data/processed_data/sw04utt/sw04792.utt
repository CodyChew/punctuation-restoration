I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California. Pretty good. Yep. Okay <beep>. D Well I definitely think, D like decisions have to be unanimous. It's probably the safest thing. Yep <laughter>. <Laughter> No. C And even D like, D you know, twothirds majority, E I mean, it's <laughter>, Yep. <Laughter>. Yeah <sniffing>. Yeah. D Like Gives them a little too much power <laughter>. C Plus, D you know, you may be, D you know, doing, D you know, a, a guilty verdict C but it may not be, D you know, it may be for technical reasons <laughter>. Yeah. I know. Yeah. It, there would be much more of that <laughter>. No. C But I. I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on. Yeah, I do too C so. No. Yeah. I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is, <snorting> it's more in how you present it versus, D you know, who's right. Yep. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. I know. When I was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff and D like, D you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, D you know, the opposition will say this, this and this and <laughter> <throat_clearing>, Yep <laughter>. C And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore. It's, Yep. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That sounds like a little abuse of our system C but, Yeah C but it's for the more general, people don't want to take responsibility. D You know, it's, Yep <laughter>. F Uh, yeah. D Well originally from Chicago C but, I really, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't either other than, <Laughter>. Yeah. I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better.. I know. Yeah. C And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left. Yeah. F Huh. Not at all. Hi, this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota. How you doing? Good. F Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it. F Uh, I'm ready whenever you are. D So, F uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there? Yeah. Yeah, I think that's probably a good thing. Yeah. E I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum C and simple majority won't do. Yeah, that's, yeah, quorums are to easy to get. C And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, D you know. C So it's, it's definitely C but, F uh, I don't know. I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing. Yeah <laughter>. Tha, I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently. C But, F uh, Yeah. About the only good thing I would say about that is it w, that it would, F uh, hurry the process up a bit C but E I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that C and that's what the trial by jury. E I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances whose to say. Yeah <laughter> no doubt. Are you involved in the legal system at all? Okay. Yeah, yeah. I've got some friends that are lawyers C so. One of them just got his law degree. C But, F uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, F uh, the system of juris, jurisprudence the way it is right now. I really haven't studied it in depth. Yeah. I'm sure of it. C Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better. F Uh, it's kind of weird. I don't know, you <laughter> I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get. It's just, Yeah. Uhhuh. C And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is, it's pretty amazing. Yeah, it's not. C And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because. D Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious C and he really gets into suing people. C And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case <laughter> D you know, it's like, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. C But, F uh, Yeah. C And, C and most of the time they're looking to place blame. F Uh and stuff. D See, you're from California, is that right? F Oh, okay. I was just thinking I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and D say where I am in Minneapolis. From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana. C And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the, what is it, it's based on common law C and the rest of the country is not or something like that. Pretty strange. C But, F uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty. C But, F uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, F uh, as a witness. He may subpoena me. C So we'll see what happens. C But, F uh, Yeah. It's, there are too many big problems, D you know. There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. D You know, to try to get them all in in a good time C and we already have too many lawyers as it is. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. C And, in fact, they're even letting some go. I, I, I'm originally from Florida C and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, D you know. That's not a, that's not a good solution either. I'm not real sure what the,
