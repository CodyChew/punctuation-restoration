Okay, D well, do you have a pet? Two cats, you're lucky. <Laughter> Your two fish. D Well, my husband, you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing. My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog. C So we have a black Labrador. Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador, C but to me, he belongs up in the field, D you know, in the ranch, in the farm C and, D Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, F uh, he sleeps in the laundry room C and then he goes out for the day. C But this, this is a beautiful dog C and he is wonderful with our little girls C and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line C and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle. C And this is huge. D You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs, he doesn't know that he's tearing up things, C but he does. C And the worst part that I had with him, A he's, he's three now was when he was, F uh, about eight months old C and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one, C and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour. C And I came home C and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall. C And it was in the floor C and I just about lost it C and I called C and I said, come home and get your dog. C And so, he said, D well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, D well, I wish you had told me D you know, C and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum. He kept picking at it C and I didn't kn, the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it <lipsmack>. C So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch. C And I told my husband, I said, D you know, it's either me or the dog, C and he looked at me like, F well, D you know <laughter>. He loves this dog C and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him C and he's a good dog, C so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to C and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic. I thought, F oh, boy, do I have a pet <laughter>. C But, I, I grew up with cats C and I'm very comfortable, Yeah. Oh. She's old. Isn't she? F Oh, I started to say then you broke your heart. Oh. Oh. Bless your heart. That makes me feel so bad. Yeah. F Oh, no <laughter>. Oh. F Oh, no <laughter>. <Laughter>. F Oh, that's awful, I never heard of that before. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Or the smell or something. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, d, now, does your cat sleep in the house? They are, they are house cats. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, good. Oh. C But the cat doesn't destruct does it? D See, it doesn't do anything. D See. F Oh, no. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, no. F Oh, that is. They do wreck things. D Well, I'm not either. <Throat_clearing> I'm not either C and it's just been, <Cough>. He's beautiful C but it's just one of those concessions, I just had to make, C but I kind of ignore him. D Now today's the first cold we've had in Texas C and it's really cold and drizzly C and it's freezing C and people are doing their fires C and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there C and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square C and he's just huddled up like, if you'll be nice to me, I won't make <laughter> any trouble, D you know. C And then my daughters both have hamsters. C And I, I, They're eleven and eight C and I gave in at Christmas C and they have, they keep their cages real clean. It always smells of cedar C and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and, <<Pause>> I think they're cutting us off. Oh. F Oh, okay. Okay. F Oh, okay. I understand. Okay, F well they'll cut us off pretty soon. Yeah, I know. <Laughter>. How does, In the salt water? Salt water or, Yeah. I have two cats. And do, and, F oh, and two fish. C And what do you have? F Oh, no. Ooh. Right. Does he sleep in your house? Right. Right. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. F Oh, dear. Goodbye <laughter>. <Sigh>. I love my cats. I had one cat for eighteen years. I got her when I lived in Hawaii. Before I even got married I had my cat. D Well, she, I had to have her put to sleep last June. F Oh, it was awful, it was just awful. C But, C and she just sat there on my lap, D you know. She just, just waited C and, F Oh, it was awful. C But her hair, C but the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's shoes. D You know, C and she just liked his shoes C and he'd have these dress sh, hundred dollar shoes. F Oh, it was just bad. C And my closet C and it was, F oh, something. F Oh, it was terrible. C And once she did it, D you know, then she would, E I mean, she wouldn't, if our shoes sat side by side, she would pee in my husband's shoes. She must have known he didn't like her or something. F Oh, anyway, I, I, C and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors, and would car, vac, F uh, clean the carpets C and F oh, dear, it was just awful. That was very funny. I, F uh, D well, I have two cats right now. C And, of course. They sleep with my kids. My kids, my, my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat. F Oh, no, I I'm not going to have a dog. We've had two dogs C and, F uh, they both got ran over. After we had them for several years, just nice little outside dogs C but were just my kids' friends, they would go jog, they would go with me when I would go running C and C and the last one got hit, F uh, as she was following my, one of my sons across the road to the school. It was awful. It was just, C And it just, it's too heartbreaking C but they do dig up C and they just, they just wreck things C and I'm not a dog person. Ooh. I wouldn't want a Lab. It sounds beautiful, C but, <Laughter>. F Um. <Laughter>. Oh. C And how old are your girls? <Beep>. F Oh, yeah. Sure. No, that's somebody's trying to cut in on my line C and I don't want to answer. I'll just wait. No, I've, I've got incoming calls C and I don't know why, body's calling. I, I hate to cut it off, I think they would cut us off, C so we'll just wait. Whoever it is will call back. D Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, D you know, jeez. D Actually, it's my son, I know it is. My older boy. He never likes to come home from school. Anyway that's what we have, C and I have, I've tried to start a fish tank C and I keep losing all my fish. No just regular water.
