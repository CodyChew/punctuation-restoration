Okay. D Well D actually, what I do, I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months, C so I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater C but I rent probably four or five movies a week. We've got a good video place out here C and, F uh, F uh, F oh gosh, F uh, I'm just <laughter> trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen. F Uh, F oh, AIR AMERICA Have you seen WILD ORCHID? D Well, it depends, do you like, F uh, steamy movies <laughter>. F Oh, okay, what type of movies do you like? Bu, d, Okay. Yeah. Do you like suspense movies C or do you like, F uh, just action C or, F Oh, JAGGED EDGE, JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. Or, F uh, FATAL ATTRACTION. F Oh, <laughter> D well I hope I don't run across them. What was your favorite all time movie? I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most, F uh, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, F uh, STAR WARS. When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that. E I mean, I guess, F uh, out of all the movies, I've, I've never been as excited to go back. I was ready to go back and see it again, D you know <laughter>. Now, I, I also liked, F uh, F oh, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA F Oh, you haven't? F Oh, yeah. No, that's, F uh, that's a, that's a real interesting movie C and it's got a good historical perspective to it. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter> D Actually, I just saw a movie, F uh, called THE LOST CAPONE. C And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers, C and I won't give the, the whole plot away C but it's, it's really a good movie. F Uh, Al Capone had three brothers, C and one of them was lost for many, many years C and, F uh, he D actually, he turns out to be a law man. Yeah, it's really interesting it, No, that's okay, I didn't give away the whole thing, I just gave away just enough to get you interested <laughter>. Yeah, it is. C And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing D like all, I've seen all of James Dean's movies. F Uh, all of Mae West's movies. C And, just kind of, kind of go out and, F uh, rent all the movies and, F uh, F uh, D you know, just kind of go, I guess you could do that, D you know, get all of David Carradine's movies, or, F uh, F uh, Segal, to, what's his first name. I can't remember his first name. Is it David Segal. I don't know, he was on, F uh, on, F uh, F uh, Arsenio, just recently. It was really kind of interesting because, Arsenio was asking him about, F uh, what he thought of, F uh, one of the other action guys. God, I can't even remember the name. He said D well, he wouldn't really talk about it. Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a, F uh, a good action guy. It wasn't Stallone, it was, F uh, I can't remember. Shoot, I can't remember the guys name. C But I like all the, the RAMBO movies. Yeah. Yo, Adrian <<imitates Rocky>>. <Laughter>. No, we, we actually rent, F uh, probably a go, good combination of movies with the exception of horror films. Don't watch really very many horror films at all. D You know, I don't know, there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you, or something, D you know, coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day, D you know. Yeah. Yeah. I just saw, F uh, F uh, a really interesting movie called, F uh, FLATLINERS. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. It was just crazy enough for th, D you know students might try to do it. D You know, E I mean, C and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, that was a great movie. Yeah. F Uh, have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY? Ye, ye, yeah, it's got, No. No. F Uh, Hogan? No, no it's got, F uh, F uh, Cheech Marin. Yeah, it is, it's kind of, F uh, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse. C But it was kind of cute. D Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS? I though that was a really cute movie, I enjoyed that. No, I haven't. I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video <throat_clearing>. Yeah. D Well my wife, F uh, has got a, F uh, a picture from Kevin Costner C and he signed it. It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES. Yeah, C and he signed it. He, he happens to be, F uh, a friend of one of her, her business associates. C And, C or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin. D So, F uh, F uh, C but anyhow we got, F uh, we got a nice, F uh, picture C and it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES C so we've got to, F uh, try to get out there and see that one. F Huh. D Now did you see, F uh, DRIVING MISS DAISY? Okay. Okay. What's, what's your most recent one that you've seen? Uhhuh. Really, I used to do that too, C but I haven't been doing it lately C but, No, see, I haven't seen that one, F uh. No, is it good? F Uh, no, not ye, <laughter> I know that sounds funny coming from a woman, C but usually I don't <laughter>. F Um, action <laughter>. I, I guess one of my favorite, D well two of my favorite movies is probably D like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO. C And those are, those are D like two of my most favorite, E I mean they're just really good movies. C And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. And movies like that. F Um, yeah, some, I guess like, what do you mean D like, D like are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO. Okay, yeah, I liked that, that was pretty good. F Um, that was okay, I, I don't, I guess I thought it was too far fetched C but so many people said F oh, no it wasn't, D you know. C But I guess, <Laughter> Really, that's true because, I don't know, I just didn't find that one to be real, I, I just thought it was too far fetched. F Um, <<pause>> F oh gosh, I don, I can't think off my head. Do you know which one yours was? F Oh, yeah, D well that's, Right. Really. Yeah, yeah, you're right about that, C but that that's really like an all time classic. E I mean, I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that. D See, I've never seen that. No, should I rent it? Should I go rent it tomorrow <laughter>. That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school <laughter>. C So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. Oh. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Really. F Oh, you just gave it away, I guess I can't go see it <laughter>, no. That does sound good, is it one, I guess it's a rental. Okay, I may have to do that. Go see it, C or go rent it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, it's not David is it? F Oh, I don't, I don't watch that <laughter>. F Um, Really. F Huh. F Oh, D see, I didn't really care, <laughter> that's, that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for C but D see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone. I don't think he's really a very good actor. I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful C but I just have never been a Stallone fan. <Laughter> Hey that's pretty good. No, I guess like I say, I just have, I don't know, I just have never seen any interest in him, C but. Oh. Yeah, I don't either <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah, you're right. D Well it's so, I guess, I'm a real, I'm a realist, C and so, when I watch movies like that, it's like this can not happen. C So, I just don't enjoy it, D you know, because it's just like, come on, give me a break. D You know, E I mean, I just C and so many of them are done so poorly, D you know that, it just doesn't even give you the effect, E I mean some of them are done good C and they do scare you. C But, F um, so many of them are just done real, I don't know, I'm not really into those. F Oh, that was one of my favorites, yes. I thought that was a very good movie. I was really impressed with that one. E I mean it was, what I liked about it was that it was a new subject. Nobody had ever touched it before. D You know, C and it was just, it was done so well, D you know, it was just, Right, D well that's probably true <laughter>. C But it was a very good movie. It was done real well too. E I mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, this can't happen. It seemed re, it seemed real, D you know it was really good. That, that was one, E I mean it's not my all time favorite movie C but it was good, it was really good. C And, F um, I don't know if you like this kind, C but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too. Yeah, I've, we've seen that two or three times. We waited C and we rented it, D you know, C but, C but it was really good. No, I haven't, I don't know if I've even heard of that one. It must have, F uh, what's his name in it. No it doesn't, Really. Yeah, Paul Hogan. No, really, I'm surprised. F Oh really, <laughter> that must be pretty good then, was it good. Oh <laughter>. Yes, yes. Yeah, it was. TWINS was good too, C because when I thought of that, I thought of, <laughter> anyway. F Um, F oh, there was another one, what's the one that just, F oh, DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet? F Oh, you've got to see that one, it's really, Right, that's probably true, that's probably true. It's, it's very, very good. Very good. That's another one that, I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it. Really. F Oh, wow, that's impressive. F Oh, neat. F Oh, yeah, it's really worth it. E I mean it's a very good movie C and yes, I would suggest seeing it at the theater. I know that they're still playing it C and they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until D like August, I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in July C and then when it won all those awards, F uh, they pushed it back to August, <<pause>> C so. C But, yeah, that one is definitely worth seeing, it's really good. Yeah, C and D you know, I didn't think that one was near as good. D You know, I guess it was okay, E I mean it was all right, C but, F um, when I compare D like the winners of this year and last year, it just, I don't know. Maybe, it's, it's not,
