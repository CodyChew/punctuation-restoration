D So, the, the topic is hobbies <laughter>. Yeah. Who has spare time <laughter>? F Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that. I used to. I used to do, D like salt ornaments and things. C But that was, F oh, good many, many years ago C and I have, I really, my spare time I <noise> usually go do aerobics and read, C and that's, about it <breathing>. Yeah. Yeah, family. D Well, D well, that's what I meant by salt that we, <noise> we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. D Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that. C But as far as, I've just never been very skilled at, far, D you know, needle, work <noise> cloths. C And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good <laughter>, C and, Yeah. Uhhuh. It's not, like you sit and knit every night <laughter>. Yeah. I don't even know how to knit C and my mother used to knit, D you know, all the time C and, C and I don't even know how to knit <laughter>, I'm like, that's a lost art from this family <laughter>. D So, F um, C but, it's not a very good topic it feels like, if, D you know, not when you're n, neither one of us are really, I, I have seen things I really like, D you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint. Needlepoint, cushions and things. C But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, D you know, and, <noise> and that the petty point and things like that. It's like, A God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. C And D see, they do that as their job. Whereas, D you know, for us it, C and they make it cheaper <noise> for us to buy <laughter>. D So, C but, C and, E I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that C because I can remember when I used to do, D you know, those little salt, those figurines and things. It was, it was relaxing, D you know, creative, you felt very creative. C But, it just was so time, time, involved, D you know, so much time involved <noise> and the different steps and things. D So, C and, Yeah. D So, Okay. I hope you have a good rest of your weekend. Okay. Byebye. In your spare time. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understood that. I'm, <noise> D you know, I work full time C and I have two kids <lipsmack> C so my spare time usually <noise> involves something with the kids. D You know, hobbies, we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies. It's more like maybe <noise> projects or something on the weekend. <noise> D You know, we like to go out <<pause>>, go out, Oh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. . Uhhuh. <Laughter>. I, I guess mostly as far as, as <noise> crafts go, I've done, F um, <lipsmack> some needlepoint. I've done mostly cross stitching. I used to, F uh, do D like, F um, one that I did for both kids are D like, F oh, <breathing> they're plaques <noise> with, D you know, different kind of animals C and then you have their birth date on them, C and then you have a little picture of them C and you frame them and stuff, but nothing steady. Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it, C but, D you know, it's nothing <noise> that I, can really, No. Not at all. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. No. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know <noise> what, what, is, it's like there, C but here a lot of the <noise> country stuff is in, D you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, F uh, stenciling. C And, D you know, you can go to any, D like a flea market and stuff C and there's just tons of stuff everywhere C and, D you know, people just do it in their garage C and then on weekends they go out and sell it C and during the week they go back and do some more. Right <noise>. Yeah <noise>. Definitely. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Okay <noise>. D Well, I think, I think we're okay. I think we did <noise> the five minutes, C so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore <laughter>. Okay. D Well, thank you. Thanks. Byebye.
