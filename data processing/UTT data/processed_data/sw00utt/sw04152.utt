D Well, <lipsmack> D anyway I, F uh, <breathing> I, F uh, F oh, yeah. I did forget to ask you. What is your name by the way? F Oh, you're Ann. Hi. C But, F uh, <lipsmack> D anyway, I, F uh, <breathing> lot of, lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good, be a good change if we're going to <breathing> be talking about the subject t, tonight which in some <lipsmack> I guess criminal courts the <breathing>, Yeah. Th, the <lipsmack> one of which was, F uh, something, something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town C and that is, F uh, C and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. F Uh, Yeah. D Well, they, they, F uh, the, the people that the, F uh, the jury that's trying, F uh, the officers in that case, is, is an all white panel. C And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that, fact. They have. They have. They moved it up to the county north of here. F Um, it's in Ventura C and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously, C and it's kind of, it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, F uh, that, Yeah. It was everywhere. D So D you know, C and I, I think it would be very difficult to find someone, F uh, find a panel that would be, not have seen it and, and known of what was going on. Exactly. D You know, F um, the <lipsmack> D you know, I, I'm kind of torn on this issue. It's like they're saying D well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true. C But on the other hand, it's, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to, are not going to convict. F Uh, D you know, they're not going to do their job. Which is the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, F uh, let go based on whether, or not the person, whether or not the evidence says, that there's enough <breathing>, F Um, They, D well, I guess it depends on who you talk to. I haven't talked to, F uh, <lipsmack> I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it C but I, I rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic, F uh, here we go again folks, kind of stuff. <Breathing> No, no. I, D you know, on, on, on one hand D you know, on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm, they have that very strong piece of physical evidence <laughter> showing, these people beating the heck out of this guy. F Um, Uhhuh. D Well, Yeah. F Um <noise>, <Sigh>. I don't know. D You know, C and, C and again there's something else tha, D you know, there was a <lipsmack>, F uh, something else along those lines. There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins. I don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety C but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was, as it was with, F uh, the Rodney King problem. F Um, a girl walked into a Korean owned store <lipsmack> C and, F uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl. She, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store. The owner of the store popped her. Yeah. C And, C and, F oh, of course, they, D you know, the criminal case went up C and, <breathing> C and the judge gave the woman who shot her, shot the girl a, F uh, F uh, practically a suspended sentence. E I mean it was it was just, she gave her no time in jail, D you know, all of these things C and then, F oh, there's we have these, we have people wondering around to, with petitions trying to get the judge, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would make, it would make life easier. Yeah. C But, F Uh, I'm Ann. Criminal courts? Yes. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. I see. I can't, I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one. Oh. D Well, that videotape was just horrible. Yes. F Oh, I agree with you C but I can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, D you know, F uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff. Right. Exactly. Based on fact. Right. How interesting. Oh. D So what's the prevailing thought within the community? E I mean you know, what the news media is going to make of it, C but what about the community? Uhhuh. F Oh, my goodness. That can't be good for Los Angeles either. F Oh, exactly. Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to <lipsmack> a big city like Los Angeles. You're going to have it just about anywhere. There. C But that's, that's interesting. What about the judge who's hearing the case? Is he going to be impartial? Is he going to, be a go, a good adjudicator? Uhhuh. F Oh, <laughter> really? F Oh, my goodness. To get that judge recalled I would think. F Huh. That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences. It would. F Uh, you would know, the whole world would know what you were facing. C And then it's a matter of, of deciding,
