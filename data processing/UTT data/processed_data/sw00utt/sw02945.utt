F Um, I'm from Maryland C and, F um, I have one son who's almost sixteen months old. Are, are you married, or... You are. Oh. That's good. F Uh, what kind of things do you do? Oh. F Oh yeah <laughter>. F Um, yeah, it's really nice, F uh, my husband, F uh, is working mo, D you know, most of the time. He's working long hours, C but, F uh, I'm staying home. F Uh, I'm just working a couple days a month, C and, F um... F Um, we spend a lot of time at the playground C and we go to the zoo, C and we go C and we wa,... Yeah, yeah. I'm a nurse. D So, yeah, D so it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule, D you know, to, F uh, get in, to, to still stay in with that, an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew. He, he's, F uh, just now really starting to, to get interested in a lot of things, <laughter> D so, F um, Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. That's right, C and I think a lot of people are, F um, are turning to, D well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that C but still there are so many people that are, D you know, have their careers first C and, it's, F uh, I think it's really hurting, F uh, the kids, D you know, C but. I know, <laughter>. That's why I like to <laughter> to, to work a couple days, I think it's, F uh, it gives me a break. Most of the time at home, yeah. F Uh, we had started out like that C and, F um, I think that was really ideal, F uh. It's, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's difficult, C but. Uhhuh, I'm, I've, I've lived here forever, D so. Yeah, E I me, I live in Germantown, C and, F uh. Are you, where are you from? In Dallas, oh. F Oh, yea,. Okay, oh, C so that explains. <Laughter>. D Well, F um, I don't know, I, F uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family, C but, F uh, as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, F uh, D you know, just my son and I, C and we're... F Uh, he, he works for Coca Cola. D So he, F uh, he manages a plant out here, C an, C and it takes a lot of time. C But, F um, it, D you know, we take walks, and <laughter> go to the library, and try to fill our day with things like that, C but, F um. Oh. Oh. Yeah <laughter>. Right. <Laughter>. That's good, that's good. I know my husband was real, F uh, in the beginning when he, F uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant C and he, F uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home, C and, F uh, C so it takes him a little bit of time. C And I'm not able to work during the week, F uh, because of that. He was, I was working in the evening, C and he was coming home C and I, I could go to work, C but, F uh, their relationship, F uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, F uh, really grew. He, D you know, just the time that they were spending together, I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together. F Uh, F oh yeah, he has, F uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters, C and they have, we have thirteen grand, D well his parents have thirteen grandchildren. C So it's, F uh, D you know, there's a lot of kids in the family C and, C and he really enjoys it. C But, F uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time, C but... C And, C and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, D you know, outrageous <laughter>. F Um, it's difficult, F uh, to do it any other way. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home <laughter>. It, F uh, I know <laughter>. I know. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh yeah, it has. I believe that too, C and I think, F uh, the kids are where they need to, D you know, they need to really focus on the children in the wor, in this country. No, I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, E I mean, D you know, I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it, C but, F um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me, C and, F uh,... F Oh, it, it really does, I, just the whole, F uh, D you know, seeing how you really are cre, are, are forming this, D you know, the mind <laughter>. That's right. Yeah. C Or, C or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide. I, I've seen a lot of people just say D well, D you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into, F uh, D you know, C but it, F um, I, I know, even just this first year, that I've been with, F uh, my son, h, here, F um, he's, I can just see how much, of, of a difference it makes staying home with him, instead of, F uh,, Yeah, that's true. D Well it's nice talking to you, too. Okay. Where are you from Tina? Yeah, uhhuh. I have, I have two children, I have a seven year old and a three year old. C And, F uh, C so I try to spend as much time as possible with them. D Well, F um, w, we do a lot of things with them, D you know, Ta, Taylor my youngest is, C or my oldest is in school C and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that. Ho, was it a big change in your life, to, F uh have a child. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. What do you do during those, those days? D Well you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though, what do, what do you do? F Oh, are you? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand that, yeah. They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age. C But my, my wife was, F uh, she worked parttime when my oldest was, was little C and now she's staying home all the time, C but, F uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children. D You know, to go from, D you know, nothing, D you know, if you want to do something every night that's fine, C but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore, D so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I agree with you, I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way C and I'm really glad she did C and, D you know, I'm glad she's staying home, C but, D you know, I know there are some days when she wi, she wishes she was back at work. Yeah. Yeah, well t, D see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too, C 'cause she worked either two to thre, three days a week C and that got her out of the house C and yet she'd get to spend, D you know, three or four days with... Yeah, yeah, C and so. Yeah, I do to, I agree, C but then when you start having two of them, it's, D you know, a little bit tougher, because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff. Are, are you from the Maryland area? Really. F Um, F uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas. Yeah, D so, F uh, I'm, I've lived here like eight years or so, my wife's from Fort Worth. C But, yeah, I work for Texas Instruments. Yeah, that explains it doesn't it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, what's your husband do? Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, yeah, I'm sure it does. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, what, F uh, my wife did some teaching at D like, F uh, D like a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year C and so that, that got me to sp, to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff, D you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom. <phone_ringing> No matter what it is, E I mean, I cou, I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them, C but, it's so much easier to go to mom, I guess they get used to it. D So, C but, D you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that, yeah, C but <phone_ringing>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, it really does C because I think yu, D you know, you grow closer. Was your, F uh, was your husband, E I mean naturally a child, E I mean ha, had he been around children, C or... Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I understand. I'm, I, D you know it's, it's hard because, D you know, then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home, E I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to. D So, yeah, that that's a tough situation, C but then, then again, D you know, some, you got to do what you got to do, D you know to get along, too, D so. Uhhuh, D we, D well like I said my wife normally feels that way, there are days when, F uh, I come home and she says here take these kids, I'm getting out. C So she's, she's had about enough during those days, C but. C But, for the most part, I, D you know, I've really feel like that's led, the way that, D you know, we, jus, like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't. C And so I think that's le, tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially. C And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, D you know, we need to do something about, C but I don't know what. Yeah. Yeah. Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child. Uhhuh. D Well, D you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, D you know, he'll mimic something that you've done, C and D you see, D you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from. C And, C and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care. D You know, th, that's how they're developing their patterns. C And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, D you know. That's, Yeah. Yeah eventually. Yeah, it's true. Uhhuh, Yeah. Yeah, plus, plus I think it becomes part of y, part of you too, E I mean, you get to stay home, E I mean it's not just for him, C but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think, D so. D Well it's been nice talking to you. Okay good luck. Okay, goodbye.
