Okay, D so I guess it starts recording now. Okay. I don't know, really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in. We live in the Saginaw area. Uhhuh. C And I'm not real familiar with, F uh, anything that, I, fact as far as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And, F uh, or the grocery store or anything <laughter> in this area, yeah. Uhhuh. Really? That is pretty good. I'm, we're originally from another state C and I know in the state we were from that they did that t, similar type thing. The city brought ought, D you know, set tr, separate trash cans C and you separated your stuff C and you put it in there C and they took it, D you know. I don't really know. I don't really know, they, they started after we moved down here C and so I, I'm not really familiar. I just know that, F uh, my inlaws up in, up in Oklahoma, that's how they do, D you know, they pick it up, C but I don't know if they get a, get anything back on it C or, do you get money for it? Oh. Really <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. Right. C And now, now most of them are throwaway. <Laughter>. I think now they're a lot more expensive than that. F Uh, I bought some Cokes the other day in the br, the little bottles D you know, C and I think the bottles were D like, I know they were at least ten cents apiece. I started to see, at home, I was like, God, how much were those bottles <laughter> D you know? < like as verb of saying! > C And, it was, they come in D like, F uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, D you know instead of six packs C and, F uh, C and they were like, it was like two dollars and something for the bottles. <laughter> D You know, I was like God Almighty, it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes. In the bot, <laughter>. Right. F Oh, really? Of green glass. D Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything. Now, I know that D like Minyard's and places like that around D like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. F Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that, C but I, I do know some of these places were doing that C and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. <Breathing>. Yeah. Yeah, more than it's worth. <Laughter>. Right. D Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away <laughter>. <Laughter> Right, F uh, yeah. <Laughter>. It was nice talking to you. I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. I, Is that it? Okay, D well, it was nice talking to you C and I, I guess I'll do this for, I was doing this for, D actually, I was going to do it for my son so that he could, F uh, A he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money. F Uh, C but then it has my name on it, C so I'm like, okay, I'll sit down here and call it <laughter>. F Oh, are you? F Oh, that's interesting. That's nice. D Well, Thank you. Bye. Okay. Saginaw? Really? The rec, we live in Plano C and they started off recycling by, F uh, putting the, I think at each WalMart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which now, I guess the, F uh, city is, has bought the big green trash cans C and, F uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now C and you separate your glass and paper and, F uh, aluminum C and you set it out C and they pick it up C and it, it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. D So, Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back for for cans even or, Yeah. No, I just, I noticed it Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can. C So you don't see too many thrown out around the <laughter> streets. Or even bottles. D You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, I guess when you purchase them C and, C and then when you turn them back in. I n, I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. Right. C So, maybe that's one thing they can do. Uhhuh. Yes. Right. That was my brother's first job in a grocery store. He was in the bottle area <laughter>. It's pretty dangerous out there, D you know, when they fall over, C but C but it's, F uh, it's quite, they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass, yeah. It's amazing. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah it's, I notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs. It, it's, people just, they, they really don't, F uh, there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff. It's, I don't know, it, it can be, it's not as easy <laughter>, selecting, D you know, clean junk as they say. <Laughter> That's right, that's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. We all do it <laughter>. D Well, it was nice talking to you. F Oh, I think, I think two or three minutes is fine. Yeah. Right. D Well, we're doing it for a church choir C so, Yeah. D So, D Well, thank you. Byebye.
