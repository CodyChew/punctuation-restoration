Where do you get most of your news? Where, where are you? F Oh, yeah. No, I'm in San Antonio. I get my news from a combination of sources. I take the paper every day C and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, C and I watch the, F uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work. C And then, D you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian. C So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<pause>>. D Well I, I, F uh, I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize. I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town. Yeah. <Laughter>. I've been getting a kick out of those lately. Although, F um <<pause>>. I, I'm only twentyfive, C so I've never actually been through a period of war C and I don't know anyone in the military C and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in, F uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff. C And I thought the generals were very interesting. D Now when they started to speculate, I, I saw that for what is was, and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on. C But I thought the, the, they were interesting, C and, C and they shed some light on what was going on for me. Uhhuh. D You know, one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C, C and it was for children C and it was hosted by Peter Jennings, C and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio, C and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions. C And they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and, and all. They had them all, F uh, on, I don't know what you'd call it other than on line. They had them all on hold C and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person, C and that person would answer the question. It was just very informative and interesting, C and, F uh, I was real impressed at how A B C handled, F uh, translating, the war for children. Uhhuh. C And our local H E B stores here, I don't know if it's H E B statewide or whatever, C but they have videos that, F uh, I don't know if they still have them, C but they were free rental, videos, that had something to do with the war. F Uh, it was, Right. It was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, F uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing. D Well back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough to call a real war F uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal. C So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news. Yeah. I tell you what, the first three days, I was glued to the television. C And I, Yeah. I tell you what. The F uh, the war start, <<blank spot in tape>> let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday? Must have been Thursday, F uh, C and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open. C Because I was watching C N N, C and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus, C and the people would be standing there in gas masks, C and you'd be hearing the sirens, C and it was just, I was amazed. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No. There are two, C and they're pretty close. F Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper, I grew up near Houston C and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck, C and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. E I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff. It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over, C and I enjoy, the comics are better in this newspaper. This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy C and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of. C So, Do you? Yeah. C And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers. He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers, I guess he takes seven, the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper, C but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University, C so he's getting all the sports sections. C And, D so, D you know, he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread... I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour, C and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends. I'm in Dallas. Are you in Dallas also? F Oh, really, okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. I normally find that F uh, I, I'm probably the most, F um, news hungry of my friends, C so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch. I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week C but, F um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning. C So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work. F Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television C and I enjoy that quite a bit. Uhhuh. I will admit I work with, F uh, someone who's Iranian, C and he definitely has a very different slant on the news. He's very, very skeptical of the news media, C and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also. C But he's, A I don't know, F uh, he's mu, much, much more so. It's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, F um, different perspective with all the Gulf goings on, F um. He was always speaking in terms of, D you know, American imperialism reasserting itself. F Um, I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country. Uhhuh. True, F um, the, They, F um, <barking> tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story. They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time. Sort of like the, F uh, A what is that, A B C's NIGHTLINE. D Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, F um, story. C But they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories. No, no. It's very much national interest news. A lot of times they end up, F um, with these panels of experts C and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions C and sometimes that, I don't know the value of that, because I saw plenty of jokes and, and, F um, F oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals, making a living <laughter> during the, the Gulf War. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I will admit it's interesting. I, I, I'm twentysix. C So I don't have any more experience in that than you. F Um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, D you know, there were some that were screaming for air power, there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it. C And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which I suppose just about everyone does, C but these guys had a, a, F uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I didn't see anything like that, although I did, F uh, I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting, this is getting a little off the topic, C but there was a, a, a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors to, to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children. I thought that was a really unusual thing. Uhhuh. <<Pause>> Ju, It, with the children's aspect? Uhhuh. I suppose that is a valuable service. Again not having, F uh, lived through another war, I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of, C or if that was a new concern with people. Uhhuh. That's true. That's true. C And <<blank spot in the tape>> probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly. I will admit the same thing. C And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer C and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program C and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated <laughter> by what I was seeing. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, I didn't have that experience. I, I don't have cable C so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job. F Um, I've got one question for you. I <<pause>> you say you take the newspaper. F Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting. We've got the one fairly, D well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription. Does San Antonio ha, you said San Antonio, right? Do you have just one paper, C or do you have several? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends. I figure I'm only taking on the weekend, C and I can afford that. I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better, C but I sort of have a liberal political slant, C and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, F um, outlook. I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit. Uhhuh.
