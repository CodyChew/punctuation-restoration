Hi. D So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have? Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then? F Um. D Well, I read, F uh, I get a bunch of different things. I get a newspaper every day C and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that C and I look through, F uh, I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover C and I, as far as, D you know, that satisfies most of the short term news I get. F Uh, don't watch much T V, don't have enough time C and, F uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, D you know, they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened C and that's about all I ever hear of it. F Uh, C but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK C and for the longer term I, I read, F uh, D like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, F uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they, the news isn't, D like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news, C but it's recent material. Yeah, it is, it is more in depth, less broad. D Well, D actually, it's, probably isn't less broad, C but it's just more in depth C and, F uh, it is, it is more sig, it is more just significant information, D you know. It is the big events, not the little events. Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, D you know. Yes, C or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news. F Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow C and, then there's nothing that, D you know, really is D like F oh, so exciting. Yeah, that, that's about what it ends up being. Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something <laughter>. Yeah, I think they're about the same. I, D you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, F uh, charter at least in my mind. C And, F uh, F uh, what, what kind of, F uh, what kind of news normally interests you, E I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring? Uhhuh. I think it will, F uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence, C but we've yet to see it C and th, it's real short term yet, though, E I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened D so, C But they like to tell us that it's going to be important <laughter>. I think it is, too. Yeah, I, I think that's a possibility, F uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too. For the companies that already have a presence over there C and, F uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninetytwo so that they would have it when it came time. Yep. C Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand. C But getting in after nineteen ninetytwo is more difficult. Yes. C And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist, even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, D you know. D Like, England doesn't want to do one thing C and, C and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing C and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. C And some of it, E I mean, is, I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified. Uhhuh. Before they open up their borders to everyone. F Uh, what is the, F uh, do you watch anything D like with sports or anything like that? <Laughter>. Against your will. <Laughter> Yeah, at least you guys have a remote control. It's sometimes better to not have one of those. Course, you can always mislocate it. E Or misplace it, E I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it C and, F Uh, actually no, C because, C because I'm in school. I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events. I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. F Uh, I don't watch a lot of it, C but that's the on, basically that's my only major source of information. What about, what about you? Yeah. C And it's more in depth. Yeah. I know, where they're just trying to fill in. Yeah. I know, I do, I do, too. Yeah, you may find one little, F uh, news item interesting C so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it. Yeah, D actually, y, you mention NEWSWEEK, I, I, I do like, F uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. I don't get to read it as much as I like, C but that's, I think that's a good magazine. D Well right now trying to keep abreast of, F uh, what's going on in Europe, D you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, D you know, European community coming together. That's going to affect our, F uh, economy quite a bit. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, F uh once, once Europe becomes unified and, F uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, F uh, kind of hurting <laughter>. Yeah, definitely. F Oh, yeah so they have a toe hold, I good toe hold. Yeah, C because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist D so, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I can understand their viewpoint, they're just, they're starting off, their economy's a little bit weak, C so you want to get established before they com, Yeah, totally. D Actually I'm not really into sports. My roommates are, C so, unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports. <Laughter>. Yeah, we have to, fight over the remote control. <Laughter>. <Laughter>.
