D Well, have you ever served on a jury? D Well, I was called C and then I was not chosen. F Oh, really? D Well, F uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that? D Well, E I mean, I think, are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, F uh, tangible C or, D Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up? No, I'm not. D Well, E I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. Say, C but, F uh, C and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, F uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective. No, I've not. I've been called, C but I had to beg off from the duty. C And you? F Um. D Well, I was, I was, F uh, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow C and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict. I don't know why. Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago. Yeah, it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason, C and <inhaling> they kind of liked me. I looked conser, <breathing> and all that stuff C and they, I don't know what they saw in me, C but they saw it. C But, F uh, back to the issue, is, F uh, I don't know, at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun. C But, there, too, there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, I think in civil cases. In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unani, unanimity remain, C but in civil cases, I think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient. D Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, D you know, there is, D like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, F uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this. C And in civil law there, D you know, is such a thing as D like, let's say, F uh, <breathing> misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that. A majority rule, I think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases. I don't know if I'm making any sense or not. Yeah, often there's more incriminating evidence. D Like, for instance, say, F uh, C and also, too, I think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, F uh, serious in a criminal case. F Um, D well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known. F Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, F uh, in a civil, F uh, civil and criminal case. E I mean, the, F uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that. D You know, I don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not. A, F uh, fellow <breathing> when he was much younger, F uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death. Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked C and, F uh, C so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system. The case was reopened C and he was exonerated. Yeah, many laws, but little justice. F Oh, certainly not, certainly not. C And <breathing>, D you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this, C but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires. D You know, the, C because you get up C and, C and <breathing> they ask you a few questions, both sides do, C and <breathing> then you, you're either challenged which is, D you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like C or, I think it's a limit now, they probably have a limit now, C but, they pretty much go through that, C and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve. For me, it was financial hardship, C so. C But, onto the thing, F uh, I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing. It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say.
