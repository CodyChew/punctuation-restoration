Yes. F Oh, how awful <laughter>. I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction. Yeah, D well, they keep it rather secretive, yes <laughter>. D Well the most recent movie I saw, F uh, I'm afraid was, F uh, D well two, two of them actually. F Uh, the RAIN MAN was one. Wasn't that fabulous, and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY. F Oh, you need to see that. That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black C and this all took place in the South. C And, F uh, normally never the twain shall meet. Yes, right, C and, F um, F uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie. The acting was phenomenal. F Oh yes, Jessica Tandy won best actress C and, F uh, Yes it did, yes it did. Just as RAIN MAN, F uh, with Dustin Hoffman, F uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise. Yes, F uh, F oh, that was, that was, F uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman. Yeah C and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just fortyfive miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton. F Oh, <laughter> we do have Kmart here, you better believe it. Isn't there a Kmart everywhere? Yes. Right, right yeah. F Oh yes. Yes, yes. D Well, D you know there are people, F uh, referred to as savants also, F uh, who can do most phenomenal things C and everyone feels they are totally retarded. That's right. It's amazing <laughter>. Yes. Yes C and the, Right, D well the warmth that developed between them C and again it, I think was a picture of relationships. Again the relationship, F uh, between the two, F uh, that, F uh, never would have occurred, F uh, by accident. Did you. Yes. Uhhuh. D Well that's tremendous, that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family. C And D see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother. Uhhuh <laughter>. D Well he at least saw it one time <laughter>. <Laughter>. Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is. He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, F uh, F uh, with the kinds of problems that he had. Yes. D Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them. D Well it's just, F uh, been delightful talking with you. Absolutely, I'm ready for it, C but they're predicting some more snow for our direction. Take care now. Bye, bye. Okay, Mary. F Um, the, F uh, the latest one I've seen, F uh, had to do with a, F uh, F uh, the, F uh, basically a manhunt, F um, C and it was, F uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually. F Uh, the, F uh, the guy, F uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. F Uh, just, F uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible. It <laughter> was true, it was truly awful. It was not one that I picked, C but, F uh, F uh, it, it did show some, some, F uh, some interesting things about the F B I C because they were the, the, F uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people C and, F uh, F uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, F uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, F uh, F uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that. C And it was, F uh, F uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures. Yeah, I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, F uh, going, I guess. Yeah, yeah. F Oh that was great one. F Oh, I loved it. D You know, I haven't seen that one yet, C and I need to go see it. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh my. You bet, especially in the South. D Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it. F Oh yeah, that's right. It, it might have one best picture, too. Yeah. That was, yeah, I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, F uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman, C but, F uh. Yeah, it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff. Oh. Is, is the Kmart there? <laughter>. That was, that was so funny, he had to, E or was it Kmart. He had to buy his underwear at Kmart. That was hilarious. The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, F uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, F uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, F uh, dropped the, the, F uh, the toothpicks, C and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image. Unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah, D wel, C because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly, C but, boy there's a lots going on in there <laughter>. Yeah, yeah C and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, F uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only, C an, C and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, D you know, C and, C and, C and you need to, to work with it, F uh, D you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag, then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example. Yeah. Right, right. I was, F uh, I was so impressed with that movie I saw it three times. I can, I can se, tell you, F oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, F uh, rang a lot of my, F uh, my personal background. I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older C and, F uh, he's not, D you know, nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him C but, F uh, C but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes, C and then, D you know, F uh, for, for, for no real, D you know, direct reason, I guess, F uh, we, we get into, F uh, F uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, D you know, back and forth C so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers. That was neat. Yeah, a lot. Uhhuh. No question, he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that. He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things. C And, C and, F uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it C but, F uh, F oh boy. He was, F uh, F uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN. E I mean he certainly didn't, he only saw it one time, C and he didn't go back for more, C but, F uh, he, he said he enjoyed it C and, C and, Yeah, yeah, C and, C and he really, I don't know, he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway. C But he wa, C but before he saw the movie he was D like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this <laughter>. I'm like, F oh, come on. Yeah. And to make it believable. E I mean I was, I was believing it, I don't know about any body else C but I was, it was great. He did great. Yeah, yeah, you take care up there C and, F uh, let's hear it for the summertime. No, F oh no. F Oh D well, take care. Bye, bye.
