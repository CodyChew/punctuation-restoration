D Well, Michael, what do you think about, F uh, funding for AIDS research? Do you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now <laughter>. You know. Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah. E I mean, I, go ahead. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. E I mean, I, I can see that research is needed C and, D you know, Definitely. E I mean it's becoming a major problem. C But, F uh. I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on, F uh, preventing it, F uh in more, D You know. Right, C and I, I feel like just saying, F uh, safe sex is not the answer. It's it's, F uh abstinence in certain cases C and <laughter>, Yeah. C And, knowing, D you know, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I think for a lot of people it has. D So, D So, Uhhuh. Drug addicts. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, boy that's a hard issue <laughter>. It really is. Yeah <laughter>. E I mean, I, I definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed, C but as you say, F uh, people, E I mean, in the meantime, D well <laughter> someone who's not ready to give up drugs, F uh, D You know. If they're perp, perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then D you know, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't either. I've heard, D you know, F uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough C and, Mostly that's what I've heard, C so I don't know, C And, yet, I know it's, F uh, it sounds like big money to me <laughter>. C But it probably takes a lot. D So, Uhhuh. Yeah. Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, F uh, that's something I've thought a lot about. F Uh, I, I work in a hospital. C And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years C and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. F Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, F uh, keep it the same or, F uh, spend more, spend less, I think F uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. F Uh, my, for my personal opinion. F Uh, C because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, F uh, vaccine for. I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with C or I think they already would have by now, D you know. C And, F uh, C so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now. I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, D you know. C And, F uh, what about you? I'm not either. I'm definitely not aware of how much. F Uh, that's something I've never really kept up with at all. F Uh, I don't, I'm not sure, F uh, I know, F uh, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the der, research, you know what I mean? <Laughter>. C And, F uh, that sort of thing. F Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, F uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. D You know <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. I think so, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that's true. That's true because, F uh, it's a, such an easily preventable disease. F Uh, No. It's definitely not. That's true, that's true. F Uh, Myself, F uh, F uh, I'm just recently, E or about to, get a divorce C and, F uh, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything. C But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, D you know. C And, F uh, because you never know what's going to happen <laughter>. You don't know who you're going to come across, D you know. Course, it's, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody <laughter> I see. C But it's something you got to think about these days. A single person. D You know, C and, F uh, E I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry. C And, F uh, Certainly. Yeah. C But, F uh, F uh, I know that, F uh, in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent, D you know, so that, F uh, the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything. C And, F uh, I don't know, I don't think that's a bad idea. I know it, F uh, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction <laughter>. It just sort of keeps that going. C But, F uh, I don't know, at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS, so far, cannot be. D You know, C so, I don't know, that, I think that's, I'm not too a, much against the, the passing out of the free syringes myself. I don't know, what do you think about that? It, It really is. It really is. They gave us a hard topic <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's true. That's true. Yeah. D You know, I guess if you consider the two problems, drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first, I guess, as far as something to, to do about it. C So, C so I don't know. F Uh, course, there's so many things in the world where, if you solve one problem, you may be creating another <laughter>, D you know. C And, F uh, C so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time C and, I don't know. C But, F uh, C but I've never looked into how much money they're spending. I have, I have no idea. C And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that. C But, F uh, I really have never looked into it. I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. Right, sure. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah I think it is. I think it is. Yeah, it does every, It seems to take more than, F uh, for any little thing they do, it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would. D You know. C But, F uh, That's one thing I've never really feared. F Uh, F uh, I, a lot of the, my family, D you know, they fear me working like that and, under some, some of those conditions, C but, F uh F uh, I don't fear it at all. F Uh, I work in, in the operating room a lot C and, F uh, C and, of course, when w,
