Certainly. F Um, D Well, I, I tend to, F uh, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sightseeing and things like that. F Oh, D well, I couldn't live without the family vacations, C but, F uh, my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, F uh, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part. C And, F uh, F Uh, not anymore. They, F uh, <breathing> they've been in San Diego for the last few years, C and they're moving to Florida. C And that's one of those things, you just have to go once a year. D So, F uh, basically it, it sorts out into that, C and then once, about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back. Oh. Beautiful <breathing> country. Beautiful country, beautiful people. C But, F uh, C and I'd real, really like to go because, F um, I'm fairly recently married C and, C and my husband has been hearing about these people for years C and, F uh, C but he's never met them, C so, F uh, I'd like, I'd like to do that. C But D anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation, C and, F uh, we enjoy the family vacations, C but the other ones are very special getaways, C and we probably take one of each every year. How about yourself? F Oh, I've never, been on a cruise. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um. D Well, what do you do on a cruise? I've never been on a cruise. <Laughter>. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And where have you been on these cruises? I see. F Oh, the, the Mexican coast. That's all Mexico, I think. Where are you from originally? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. D Well, I, I grew up in Dallas, C so E I mean, it's not, it's not like I'm going home. My, my parents retired first to San Diego, C and they're going now to Florida, C and so they're going very nice places, thank God, that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know. I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there. They've been there eight years. C And, F uh, D you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere. D So it, it is, it is nice, C but it's not home. This is home, C and, F um, C and I've never thought about a cruise. It's so funny. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. What's the best part, from your point of view? Uhhuh. F Oh, that will be nice. F Oh, sure. Sure. D Well, go in, don't go in the winter. Oh. D Well, th, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that. C But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer D so, F Huh. D Well, that sounds wonderful. I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, F uh, F oh, all circumstances permitting it. Uhhuh. F Huh. How long are the cruises? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas <laughter>, I, go for a long time. F Oh, that's interesting. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Huh. That's really nice. Uhhuh. F Huh. D Well, may, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen. D Well, that, that's really great. F Uh, E I, I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents C and, F uh, <Laughter>. C And, C and, F uh, we had, my husband had a conference in L A, C so we spent a week in L A C and of course, F Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very unusual. I like, Lynn, do you, do you want to start? Okay. Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken C or, Uhhuh. Which is your favorite? Uhhuh. Your family doesn't live close, then? Okay. Yep, I understand. Wow. I've only been there once. C and I'd love to go back. C And it was, Yeah, it, we had a great time. D Well, F uh, we, we, as you do, take family vacations, F uh, sometimes one a year, C and, C but this year we're not going to be taking one for <breathing> several reasons. C But vacations we really enjoy, I think we've been on three cruises. C And we, we really love cruises. We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES. C And, F uh, we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go. F Uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready to go. C And we get upgraded. Last ti, last two times, in fact, we had an outside room C and it was beautiful. C And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around. It's kind of, F Oh, my God, you do everything. You, E I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be. You can sit in the sun all day around the pool, C or you can take part in the games that they have going on. They always have bingo. They have a casino. F Uh, they have a massage parlor. They have exercise, E I mean, you can do anything. C And that's just aboard ship. C And then when the ship docks, you get to go sightseeing and shopping. C And that's quite fun. F Uh, Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas. We've been there twice. We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people. We, we've gone with friends each time. C And then we went to, F uh, the western Caribbean, which is, F uh, Port, F uh, Cancun, Cozumel, and Ocho Rios. Pardon me? Yes, uhhuh. C And, C but it was wonderful. C So we really like those. C And, F uh, I guess we just like to go someplace, someplace entirely different. We've been to a few places in this country. We still have a lot to see, though. We're from Illinois originally. C And we've been down in Texas eighteen years, C and so, like you, we always try to make it, D you know, back home to see the relatives. We both still have family there. C And that's fun. It brings back a lot of memories. F Uh, things are different there, though. They're, F uh, I don't know. It's just entirely different world than this area. Did you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Buzz>. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's great. F Oh, they, they, they really are. We've, D yeah, as I said, we've done them three times. We'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed. We, we'd probably go. My husband would, D you know, the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit. He kind of likes the casinos a little bit. C But I like all of that. I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places. I like shopping. I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever. Now, my kids are moving to Toronto, C so we're going to be able to go up there. C So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go. C But, F Oh, that's what everybody says, C and I, I think it's, I think I'll try to stay away, except my, my second grandchild will be born in <breathing> in the winter in January. C So that will be hard to stay away from. Yeah. Isn't that the truth, uhhuh. D Well, there's all age grou, groups too, C and that's, that's kind of fun. F Uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people. You may meet people, D you know, thirty years older than you, or younger, C and everybody is really interesting, C and everybody is there to have a good time C and, F Uh, we've only gone on the seven day cruises. They have shorter ones C and then they have ten day ones. C But I think seven days is long enough for us. By that time we're <breathing> ready to get home and get back to our routine. I think most vacations, F uh, seven days is enough for us. We've gone, I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days, C and that was pushing it a bit. Yeah. D Well, that, that makes sense, it really does. E I mean, F oh, we went to Panama too. Went to Panama last August. Our soninlaw is from Panama. C And, F uh, we went with our daughter and soninlaw to visit his parents, who live there. C And his father is a, a doctor C and his mother is a kindergarten teacher, C and they took time off, it was <breathing> their winter C and they were having a little break, C so they took some time off that, F uh, they could show us around. C And it, it is a beautiful country. It is beautiful. They have mountains. We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore. C And it, it is gorgeous. They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica. C And, F uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country. Most people don't realize it. I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably. Yeah. We really hope, hope so. Yeah. D Well, that, that's, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. F Oh, do you like L A?
