Anyway, F uh <breathing>. What do I do, F uh, at the moment it's under chaos. <laughter> F Uh, <smack> right now I'm just, F uh, I, I don't really have a budget per se. I'm, I, F uh, it's called living within your means <laughter>. <Laughter> D You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control <inhaling> and hoping the car doesn't collapse <laughter>. F Uh, C but, F uh, no I don't really have a budget at the moment. F Uh, C but I have F uh, I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month C and then I don't, <inhaling> usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if I have car expenses C and then that, then it goes through the moon, C so. Yeah, D so F uh, what do yo, So you can afford to get a house? <Laughter>. Yeah. <Inhaling>. Yeah. D So, what do you and your husband do? <Smack> Are you really? F Um. No kidding. I see. Overseas, where would you be going? <Smack> Really. Really. How long would you be there? With, with what Church? F Oh yes. Yes, I, F uh, I know who they are. They, F uh, <inhaling> they have an office, F uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall. There, there was, F uh, D you know, there was a fairly large building that that was D well that belongs to them. D So, F uh, are you, F uh, are you, F uh, active in translation? Uhhuh <noise>. True, true enough. D So, F uh, what, what, F uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course? Uhhuh <<very faint>>. <Breathing>. In France. <Laughter> <breathing>. F Uh, Must have been terrible. The, F uh, <smack> was it Henry Macon said that the, the, F uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. C So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die C and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that. Free style English is just, takes on, How about you. What do you do with your budget? Uhhuh. Yeah. That's true. Yeah, that's sort of a problem. We're trying, we're trying to, F uh, so far we are in the clear credit wise C but, F uh, the other side of it is, C so, not much on that side of it <laughter> to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that C but, Yeah, we'd like to do that some day. We have this dream. C But, we don't know how long it will be a dream. We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt, C but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, F uh, economy right now C so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, D you know, on top of expenses every month. We're missionaries actually. Yeah, uhhuh. C And, F uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, F uh, D like, F uh, F uh, support quota C and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. C And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. D So, Africa, Nigeria. Yeah. About four years. We're career C so, we, we go over seas for four years C and then we come back for a year. We go over four, we come back for a year. F Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators. D So. Yeah, they could very well C and, F Uh, we will be. I was over, over four years doing language surveying which is the first step. You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need. C And, F uh, came home and got married C and we will go ba, back as translators cause we want to raise a family C and it is easier to raise a family as translators. D Well, I always wanted to do translation, C but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. D You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere. You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. D Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones, C but there's, I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other, D you know, since I did D you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other. C So I know the greetings in about ten, and how to do market stuff, C but in about, F uh, about five I guess, I can do better in it. C And my French is pretty good C but it's, F uh, French C so, F uh, I'm terrified to speak in, F uh in France. Yeah, C because they're real snobby about their language C and French is street French C and I just picked it up off the street C and I knew what I was, I knew what I was communicating, C but I didn't know what I was saying. I never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when I came home and French to somebody C and he paled and said, F uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said. C So, <noise> since then I have refrained from speaking any French <laughter>. D So. <laughter> In <laughter>. I don't know what I said to him C but, F uh, I didn't ask him either.
