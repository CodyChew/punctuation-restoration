Okay, I guess it took, D so I guess the recording has started now. F Uh. I served, I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, F uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury. A lot of the same rules apply. Have you ever served on one? Uhhuh. Was it civil or criminal? A grand jury or, Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, did, did the judge, F uh, hand down sentences C or did you folks do that? Uhhuh. F Um. No. That that's a science in itself. Uhhuh, I see. Because you'd probably be, F uh, too puritanical C and . Uhhuh. <Laughter> D So, F uh, were, were the, F uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair, C or would, if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different. F Huh. F Um. Wow, I bet that made him happy. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, how many members were on the jury? Was it a six or twelve member jury? Uhhuh. That's kind of curious to me. I didn't realize until the, F uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, F uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries. I thought that they, D you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak. C But, F uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment. I know on a <breathing>, getting to this unanimous thing, whether, D you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous. It's a simple majority, D you know, rules. . Probably on capital, I don't know, we weren't, we, we, the two that I were on had to do with drugs C and, F uh, we were, F uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, F uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things, the government really failed to prove its case, C and, D you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof, C and we had to acquit him in both cases. F Uh, yeah, it was, D yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person, C but something happened to the camera and the tape and all they could do was testify, Yeah. D So, have you ever served on a jury? Yeah, I finally served on one last year. I've, F um, been voting for years, C and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet C and I finally was. C So it was an interesting experience. I was kind of boring. F Uh, it was, F uh F uh, it was, F uh, D well, D let's see, it was municipal court C so it was a combination of, F uh, C and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks C so it was a combination of criminal and civil, C and they had, F uh, <inhaling> D well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors C and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, F uh, just sit in the jury room. F Uh, yeah, the judge did. F Uh, I, F uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury. I kept getting, F uh, I'd be questioned, F uh, for empaneling the jury, C and they kept, F uh, dismissing me. Course they don't have to give a reason, C but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, D you know, they want to get the best, F uh, mix for their case, C so they ask all kinds of wild questions. Yeah, D well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions, C and I think part of it was they didn't, F uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more. D So. <Laughter>. Yeah, that was probably it, C although in my case I might have been more, F uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught, I don't know. <Laughter>. D Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing. F Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, F uh, on my next to the last day, C and, F uh, we got into the, F uh, jury room to, F uh, decide the case, C and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, F uh, not guilty, C and he would never vote for guilty. C So, F uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman C and I, F uh, didn't think that, F uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict, C so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate. C So the whole thing had to be tried over again. Yeah. <laughter> Yeah, it was, F uh, it was funny. The, F uh, I ju, I, I don't know, I, F uh, I didn't, F uh, F uh, I didn't like not being able to deliberate. I, F uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy, C and the other people were kind of mixed D so, F uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again. Cost him a lot of money, I'm sure. F Uh, it must have been six. Yeah. F Um. F Um. Yeah. Well, let's see, is it on, F uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous C and, Uhhuh. F Uh, it was too circumstantial? F Um.
