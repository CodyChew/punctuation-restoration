Hello? How you doing? I'm Lee with, F uh, F uh, I'm over here in Plano, Texas. F Oh, sure. <Sniffing> <cough> Oh. Where are you calling from C or where are you at? Arlington. D Well, there's a lot of s, stuff going on in Arlington these days. Are you involved in any of that? No. <Inhaling> D Well, F uh, <breathing> what benefits do, D now, do you work? F Oh, you are? Okay. Yeah. C Because I, I work for myself C and so, F uh, <sniffing> there's a lot that I, that I guess I do miss, F uh, a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation. I miss, F uh insurance and F uh, the steady paychecks that come. C But, F uh, F Oh, is that right? Uhhuh. Yeah. I, F uh, I own part of a roofing company. In the, in the Dallas, Fort Worth area. C And, F uh, D you know, unfortunately we, we were part of a, of a bigger, bigger company C and they, F uh, D you know, we, we had all the benefits there C and, C and I do miss that. D You know, C but, F uh, on the other hand, I, I, F uh, I enjoy having the, the time that I have with my family and being able to, D you know, work when I want C and, <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. F Oh, is that right? Yeah. It's, Yeah. It, it, Yeah, I'll tell you what, that is the single most F uh, benefit that I, that I enjoyed, and I do miss C because I looked into picking up some, F uh, medical insurance for my, just for my family, D you know, just, and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it. C And, F uh, yeah, F Oh, yeah even at a group rate. F Uh, it's, it's unbelievable C and, F uh, the amount that you have to pay for, D you know, for kids C and, C and if you want to add dental to it, E I mean, that's that eats even more. D So, yeah, I guess what, the other benefits that, F uh, that I, F uh, that I miss, I guess is, F uh, D you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company, D you know C and <inhaling> course, these days, you can't count on that because <breathing> <laughter> F uh, D you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, F uh, G M deal there in in Arlington C and I'm sure it will be, D you know, quite a few people are affected by that D so, Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Is that right? The union, yeah. Is that right? Yeah. D Well really the, Yeah, really the ones it's going to hurt is, is actually the, the businesses around in that area. D You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that, F uh, <Sniffing>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, I'll tell you, I I've had my fill of unions <laughter>. I, F Oh, yeah. Hello. Fine. Okay. Let me ask you something, can I run a minute and shut my radio off? Okay. Okay. Arlington. Arlington, Texas. Yes. Yes, not all good stuff. No. No, I'm not, not personally. I'm going to school right now. I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think. I've got a lot of, Uhhuh. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes, I've been in my own business, Mary Kay, in fact, I'm selling in out now to go to school full time C and I enjoyed the freedom of having that, D you know, go to work when I wanted to or not C but, D you know, the benefits weren't there. D So, F Oh, do you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah, uhhuh. I think today the thing that I, F uh, would appreciate the most, F uh, C because my husband gets, his medical through his company, C but we have to pay for mine C and we're the only one, I'm the only one that's being insured C and C and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has, E I mean, <laughter> C so it's kind of, C And I would, I really, C and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha, you need to have. Right. It's out of sight. Right, it's out of sight. Even at a group rate, I couldn't believe how much is our, Right, it goes up. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right, it's going to hurt the city, C although, F uh, I will personally tell you, I used to work at a bank, C and I would see the G M people come in when they were, they would shut down to retool. They were paid that whole time C and I don't know, if you're aware of this r, Yes, they come in there, D just, they go off fishing and stuff and come in and, every Friday, and go to the safety deposit box, C and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week, D you know C and, C And they had all these gr, I, I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked. C And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck. I just read this in the paper the other day. Plus probably an additional six months through the, the worker's stuff that they have at, at, F uh, through the company C so I'm sor, D you know, I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt, C but I don't feel as sorry for them, If my husband were laid off tomorrow, we'd get one more check C and that would be it. Yes. F Oh, yeah, that's already hurting. C But I think there's a case, where benefits have gotten, they voted them in C and they got so good, E I mean, like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical, all these things, D you know C and it made the prices of cars go up C and C and, D you know, the, I, we, I believe in unions, C but they went too far. E I mean, I can't make eighteen dollars an hour. I E mean, I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour.
