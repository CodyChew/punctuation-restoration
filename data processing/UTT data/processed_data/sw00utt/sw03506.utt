Angie. Okay. F Um, let's see, F uh, I like seafood. F Uh, let's see, F uh, shrimp, steamed she, F uh, shellfish with maybe herbs. F Uh, <lipsmack> spicy lobster with lem, linguini. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. F Uh, I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too. F Uh, C and that way, you can have a variety. F Uh, <Lipsmack> F Uh, Yeah, fresh vegetables would be good C or, F uh, just, No. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, all these hard questions <laughter>. F Uh, what, white wine? Yeah. I'm not really a drinker, C so I'm not, I don't know a lot about that. F Oh, goodness. F Uh, chocolate, something chocolate. F Uh <laughter>, Yes. F Oh, you do? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. That sounds good, too. Traditional right? Yeah. I just started, I just really started, F uh, F uh, learning about that C and I bought a Martha Stewart, I don't know if you've heard of her. Her cookbook C and she talks about catering and, F uh, D you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, different types of parties, D you know, different types of foods. F Um, my father owns a restaurant. It's, it's just a, F uh, c, a cafe, C so it's not really anything, D you know, that I want to, it's not the same <laughter>. F Uh, it's in Lewisville. Trinity. That's public. No, uhhuh, it's not. <Laughter>. F Uh. Let's see, what about Hawaiian luau. Could have, F uh, F uh, fruits and, and pineapple, F uh, let's see, F uh, I think, I think decorating your food is, D you know, really, Now is it Stacy? Angie, I'm sorry. D Well, D now, D so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make? That sounds good. D Now what is, F uh, what is, F uh, the steamed shellfish you said? C And what would that be like, a clam or, F uh, Okay. C So if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, F uh, seafood for supper, what type of, F uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal? D Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or, Probably not nachos and dip, F huh? <Laughter> C And would you, F uh, would it be appropriate to, F uh, drink with the, F uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres? Okay. C And then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, F uh, with the, with seafood? <Laughter>. That would be my guess. C And, C And then, F uh, F uh, dessert. Something sweet? You must like chocolate. <Laughter> D Well, let's see. Usually when we have a dinner party, I always, I like to grill. D So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, F uh, some dip, F uh, some cheese. One of our favorites is, F uh, to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think, A is that what comes in those little blocks? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, F uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, F uh, sauce and then take crackers C and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese C and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail. C And then I like to barbecue, D like steaks or pork chops. C And then we have, F uh, s, F oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad C and then, F uh, I don't know what we usually have for dessert. Cake sometimes, C but, F uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, I guess. C But that's, I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, F uh, that's more for D like when friends come over. Traditional, yeah. I wouldn't be the big, F uh, snotty kind. <Laughter>. Huhuh. F Oh, D well, do you work in a, F uh, in a setting where you, F uh, are in the food business? F Oh, in, F uh, Is it in Dallas? Okay, all right. D So you graduated from which high school? Trinity, okay. C And that's a public school or private? F Huh, okay, I have to get to know this area a little better, I guess. F Uh, D well, is your father's cafe, F uh, one that you could cater out of? F Um, C and he's not interested in letting his twentyone year old daughter experiment with it probably. <Laughter>. D Well, let's see, what else for catering. F Uh, F Oh, that would be good. C And you could actually go with, F uh, a chicken if you wanted to.
