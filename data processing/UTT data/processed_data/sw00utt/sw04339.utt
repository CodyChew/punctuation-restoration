Yeah, Jonathan, F uh, you s, you say it's near and dear to your heart. Buying a car is, F uh, something you're contemplating, I take it. F Uh. Uhhuh. F Uh <<faint>>. Uhhuh. F Wow <laughter>. They get, Uhhuh. What do you think you'll, F uh, what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I think the next car we get will probably be a <breathing>, D well I, I like Buicks. We have a Buick Century now, it's a nineteen eightyseven C and, F uh, whatever I get, I want to have, F uh, air bags, F uh, both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to, D you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over, C so I think the four door is probably a major requirement C and, other than that, F uh, D you know, reasonable cost and safety and, F uh, as much economy as you can get out of a car. F Uh, D you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine, F uh something that will carry it around careful, I guess is best, best way to describe it. Right now, we've got a V six C and it, that seems to be just fine. I know they s, they're coming out with some V eight now C and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age. Uhhuh. Right. I, F uh, I drive a, a truck, a Ford truck. I, I like trucks because they're spacious, C and it's handy to haul things. F Uh, it's not related to my business, I just really use it, basically, for transportation, C but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that, C and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one. Traction? F Uh, not really, F uh, D you know, it's a two wheel drive truck C and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway <laughter>. Wow. Uhhuh. What kind of, what make is the mini van? Mazda, I see. Right. One of my sons has a, a Plymouth, F uh, van or, D you know, F uh, F uh, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess C and, F uh, they have a, a child that's five years old C and it's really handy for hauling him around and, and their stuff, C and, of course, as he gets friends, I'm sure that will be even handier. C So, I know if we were, if we had kids still at home, A we're in our fifties now, C but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value. What about, F uh, all wheel drive? Is that something that you'd be interested in C or is that, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. F Uh, fantasizing about. Can't do it right now. Our situation is that we're a two car family C and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago. It's got a, F uh, five year loan, C so that's still got a couple years to run C and the car I get to drive is a, F uh, Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month C so, I think about, F uh, sprucing that up in a couple years if I can. D Well <breathing>, since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about <laughter> a forty year old man's car, something, F uh, something real sporty C but, F uh, realistically with, F uh, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, F uh, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. Something a little seating room. How about you? Uhhuh. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back, C so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes. C And, F uh, D you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, D you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon. Sure. Is, F uh, traction much of an issue for you up there. . Actually, F uh, pretty good way of looking at it, yeah. We, F uh, we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago. A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm C and we weren't aware of it, and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car, C and, this is a rear wheel drive model. C So, we got some monster studded snow tires after that. Haven't had any problems since. It's a Mazda. C And, F uh, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, F uh, driveability. Fuel economy isn't great, being a mini van, C but, F uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others C and it's, F uh, got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around C so we've been able to do some real creative, F uh, load hauling when called upon. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I think that we're going to be, F uh, owning a mini van for some years to come. Probably till the kids are out of, F uh, high school anyway. F Uh <breathing> I'd be satisfied with a, a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra. C And even as, as light as that is with, F uh, the small tires it's, it's done pretty well in winter, F uh, again, like you, if conditions are, are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway. C So I know I'd be happy with a, a reasonable, F uh, four door. D You know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with getting kids into the,
