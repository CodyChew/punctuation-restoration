Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like, F uh, D you know, three or four years ago. I'm a senior in, in, F uh, college now. C And, F uh, I can't really talk too much about <laughter> the problems with, F uh, public education in detail because the school system I went to was, F uh, really superb even though it was a public school system. Oh. Okay. Yeah. I got a friend who goes there, by the way <laughter>. I want to as, talk to you about that afterward, okay. <Sniffing> Yeah. Yeah. It was a, a, it's a more or less a suburban school system? Yes. That, that was true for mine too. F Uh, although I <throat_clearing> I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, C but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. D You know, I think that, F uh, E I mean I know that in my town, D you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education. C And, F uh D you know, C and so the students were, D you know, to some extent, motivated to <laughter> learn. I E mean E you know <laughter>. <Inhaling> Yeah, that's true. C But <throat_clearing>, C but, F uh, I think, E I mean even more than that, even, E I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read <laughter>, D you know? Which it, <laughter> E I mean it sounds like, F uh, now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, F uh, they have of these, F uh, sort of mandatory <<mispronounced>>, tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma. C But, F uh, C but, F uh, certainly before that, there were people that, D you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read. F Uh, C and that's just sort of inexcusable C and you can't really, E I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. D You know, except maybe to someone whose, D you know, really badly learning, F uh, disabled or something. C But these people obviously <laughter> weren't. <Noise> <<sounds likes a burp>>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. E I mean, I don't, I think D you know, people just, Yeah. C And, again, I don't, E I mean they got to know the, D you know, how qualified, E I mean, I think it'd be interesting to, D you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. F Uh, D you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, F uh, high school. D You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. I think that'd be an interesting experience. C But, F uh, I haven't done that <laughter> <sniffing>. <Throat_clearing>. C But I do, I do think that, F uh, E I mean, public education in general I think can work. C And I think it's a good thing. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. E I mean, I don't, I honestly don't really think I could have, D you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in. E I mean. Yeah. <Throat_clearing> Yeah. E I mean, C and C and in the, <Sigh> once you book junior high, F uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels. D Well, no, I guess it wa, in junior high, it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of, F uh, of instruction in the major subjects. F Uh, which, E I mean, actually I think that works pretty well. C and that, that makes, Uhhuh. Really? Yeah. I feel that my, F uh, I'm a junior in college now. C And I go to Tech, Georgia Tech? C And I, <Laughter> Okay <sniffing>. F Uh, I've, the high school I went to was, F uh, was a good one also. C And I, D well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. C Because the one I went to was, D you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, D you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta. Yeah. <Sniffing>. What d, Yeah, that's true. Yeah. C And I'm also E I mean, in the, in those places where, F uh, D like the economy is really bad, they might, D you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, D you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would <sigh>, D you know, in areas where they <sniffing> yeah, Uhhuh. Yeah. That's true. Right. <Sniffing>. Yeah. That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow, D well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area C but I still, E I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, D you know. C So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, F uh, grow up in a really oppressed region <rustling>. D You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people. <Sniffing>. C So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, F uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn C and, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. No, I, I can't say that I have either. <Sniffing> C But, F uh, Yeah. I've, I've heard some, E I mean I've heard sta, sta, statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. E I mean within D like, within the <thumping> same, F uh, income groups. If you compare the, D like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, D you know, the people that, F uh, did send their kids to private schools. I think they compare fair, D you know, fairly well. Yeah. I, I, I, my schools, E I mean, there, I have a lot of once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, F uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that. That, E I mean, that makes a big difference C cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, F uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh.
