D Well. Yeah, F uh, I guess I basically agree that, F uh, do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs? E I mean suppose they found out some other way? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C But, have you ever been in a situation where you, you were drug tested C or, Yeah. I once too, D so. Yeah. Yeah. I had it during a job interview, C and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to, to want to work for them to do this, C and I'm just like, D well, F uh, <laughter> I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well like you say, E I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really what people ought to be doing, E I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors. C And, E I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons. Yeah. . D Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this C or, Yeah. I tend to, to view it, even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in, F uh, in addition to an individual's rights, C but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to C and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that. F Uh, C and I don't really, D Well, F uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, F uh, very specific in this, F uh, very specific examples such as, F uh, transportation workers, as in, F uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing. F Um, I don't really <breathing> think that it's, F uh, too many, I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, D well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, F uh, D you know, worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very, very valid, F uh, thing for a company to say, C and I, personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body. D Well, I think, I think we, I think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs. There's too many cases where it can, D you know, there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing. I don't think there's any definitive, D you know, okay this person is taking drugs, C so we don't want him here. F Uh, like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary, I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane. C But, F uh, I, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that, that it's such a, a big deal. E I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you C or, D you know, it, I just, I think it's a whole trust issue. I just can't see it. F Uh, yeah, I have been. I. E I mean, I was very offended by, by the whole process. E I mean it's very humiliating, C and, E I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs, C but I, F uh, I am totally against that sort of a, F uh, <noise> E I mean it's, it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. That's, that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, D you know, I did, I, I was in the same sort of situation as, it was a job interview C and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested, C and it's, I just, C and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, D you know, been hired by a corporation which, F uh, D you know, I really. The other side of it is, is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, as in my, it's my bodily fluid C and I don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that, just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work. I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say this is, these behaviors are acceptable and these are not, C but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also. Right. Right. That's exactly right. C And also I just think it, it gets a lot, I'm a big, F uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies, C and I think that it just moves down along a line that, that I really would find bad if, if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, D you know, there's already talk of people, D well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke. D Well, D you know, I, I can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke, C but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all. F Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or, or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. C And other than that I think, I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to, to want to do that. It should, it's kind of the big brother syndrome, <laughter> E I mean, I just, anything like that just kind of scares me. Right. Right.
