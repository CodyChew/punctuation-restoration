You want to go first? <chiming>. Okay. F Uh, one of the things they talked about was, F uh, did we, d, wh, what do we think about a judge making the decision? C And I really don't agree with that <swallowing>. I think that the trial by jury is better, F uh, D you know, than e, having a <chiming> unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time. Yo, you know what I mean? Yeah. Right. That's it. D Well, I, I feel the other thing too, F uh, they were saying, F uh, D you know, what new ways could y, could it, D you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, F uh, we spend a lot of time, F uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, E I mean, i, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, D you know, point blank in the crime. There's, F uh, no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt. D You know, all these things. E I mean, D you know, we've gone through this over and over again. C And it can go on for ten, twenty, years. I, I think this is a little ridiculous. <Swallowing> I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers. I, I'm serious. C And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha, that exist in the s, in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining. D You know, if someone is ill, D Well. D Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. C But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. E I mean, D you know, people who commit, F uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly C but D you know, they get lesser sentences C and I understand that the jails are full of people, D you know, F uh and that they have to do something. C But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it. Yo, you know what I'm saying? That w, we don't have, F uh, D well a lot of states don't have capital punishment. C And, F uh I, I think they should. I, C and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people C and, F uh, D you know, all they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life C and if, they should pay for it with their life. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Oh, really. It, F uh, <laughter>, Yeah. I know that, that. Uhhuh. C And, I don't know. F Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better? F Oh, yeah. I, I, I don't agree with that at all. Imagine the guilt that person would have. E I mean burned out. There's there's no possible way that you could, F uh, D you know, feel good about yourself. If you had to do something like that, day after day. No. Not really. <Rustling> D Well, w, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like, E I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you. In other words you're saying that, w, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I, I, <Static> No, you can start <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. There's, there, th, this topic is kind of mute. F Uh there, there's no way. We, we couldn't survive in a sy, in a juror syst, in a trial system without a jury. F Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case. F Uh, every person has their opinions C and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. F Uh. <Noise> <<sounds like something is being sliced>>. Right. <Meow>. Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal. <Meow>. Yep. Uhhuh <laughter>. F Oh, that's right. I work for a law firm <laughter>. Right. D Well plea bar, plea bargaining is a different story. Plea bargaining is something completely different. That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up. Right. Right. F Huh. Right. We do <laughter>. Right. Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal, F uh, procedure was concerned. <Inhaling> We just have the case, I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry. F Uh, his f, last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up <laughter>. C So, E I mean, his appeal was denied C and two days later he got out of jail <laughter>. For cocaine possession. C But, F uh, <clicking> <swallowing> that was absurd <laughter>. There is never, there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence. D Well, F uh, the, the only I can, I wa, D you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. F Uh, a, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd. There's no way that could work. F Uh, C but, F Oh, exactly. Exactly. Right. No one would want the job <laughter>. <Thumping> F Uh, <lipsmack> C and, D you know, like I said, the, D you know, everyone has their opinions about every case. F Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, F uh, entitled to a trial by jury. That, that, that right s, D Well, E I mean, were there witnesses? Right. Right. That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case. E I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching <laughter> a murder take place C and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances <static>.
