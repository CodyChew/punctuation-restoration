F Uh, we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie. Yeah. It's about, F oh, about six months old, C and we're try, we live in an apartment, C so, we don't have a yard, C so it has to stay inside C and we're having a difficult time trying to train it. It's about six months. Really? <Inhaling> C But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs, C but I guess every one, one <laughter> one, one of them, E or every once in a while, you get one that's not so <laughter> intelligent because this one, it. Uhhuh. Yeah, D so how'd you all, how do you, what's the best method? Right. <Throat_clearing>. Stand outside with them until they. D Well, we're hardly ever at home, C so it's kind of difficult, C and, D you know, you don't want to, you don't want to spank it or scare it, or anything like that, C so. Yeah, we, we try to take it, D you know, it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside C and, D you know C and then it runs right inside C and it does it. F Huh? Yeah, a lot of times, C and D you know, it won't it's little job <laughter> outside C and it comes inside. F Uh, yeah, we've tried that, C and, F uh, D you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go, C so, C and he chews on plants and all that, C but, D you know, that's natural for a little puppy. F Huh? F Oh, really. F Oh, that's sad. <Laughter>. How old is it? Man that's sad. F Oh, of course not. I couldn't. That is really sad. What, what's the deal, we, we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, D you know C and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash C and <laughter> so it, E I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, D you know, tug on it to walk it. E I mean, it just goes like a mad dog, E I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping, C and it's, D you know, <throat_clearing> E I mean, it's <laughter> not even close to even being trained on a leash. Uhhuh. D Well, we've heard bad, we've heard some bad things about some of those, D you know, they sometimes mis, misuse their license or whatever D you know, they treat them bad. F Oh, really? F Oh, really? Uhhuh. How long did it take? Every, what? F Oh, really? D Well, Sheltie Collies are, D you know, timid, C and they don't really, unless they get used to something, they're really nervous C and. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, yeah, C and, F uh, if they're not accustomed to something, they, they're really scared. C So. Do you? How old is it? F Uh, you, you're, you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership, I think. D Well. I don't, I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence, really, the, the, the training bit, F uh. I've had dogs through the years. Right now I've got two, and three cats, C but, F uh, C and my son and daughterinlaw have kind of a Sheltie mix, C and we watched it this summer for two to three months, C and it wasn't trained quite fully either C and, F uh, C but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog. I don't know. I, I'm old fashioned, C and when I got my, my dogs, when they, when they did something I hollered at them and threw them outside. They say that's not the way to do it now. You're just supposed to No, just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you ca, catch them in the act. Yeah. No, no, you don't want to do that, C but, F uh. Does, does it just want to sniff around? Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside? Yeah. Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside? Yeah. That's nothing, F huh. D Well, it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you. I, I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever, C and she's gone the other way, because she's so old, she doesn't have much control C so we're battling with that problem C and she still feels good. F Uh, she can't hear worth a darn or see very well, C but she's got a great appetite, C and she knows we're there, by smell. She'll be sixteen in May. C And yeah, C but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years, C so we're putting up with all her accidents, C and the la, two nights ago, she had diarrhea, C and so that was a bad one. C But, F uh, I think we're buying a carpet <laughter> shampooer this weekend <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Does it, F oh. Uhhuh. D You know, maybe you nee, you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes. Oh. D Well, D you know, we went, we went to the junior college, Richland C and we took, my, my daughter was living at home then, C and she took our Golden Retriever, F oh, not the Golden Retriever, the Norwegian Elk Hound over there C and, it, it, it's a pretty good class, C and they did pretty good, except this dog is, she's just pretty, she's not smart <laughter>. C So, she didn't learn a lot, C but it, I think it calmed her down a little bit, C and she's used to being around other dogs now. I think it was D like a six week program. F Uh, I think it was one night a week for D like six weeks, C and, F uh, D you know, it was a group class, outside. It was fairly reasonable, too. Yeah, they're, they're usually, a highstrung dog aren't they? F Um, our, our friend has a,
