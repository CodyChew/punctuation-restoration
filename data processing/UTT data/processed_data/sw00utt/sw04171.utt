D So, F uh, do you happen to be working for a large firm? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, I work for a fairly large company. It's got eight thousand people. C And, F uh, <breathing> we do have health insurance. We don't have four O k, one K plan, stuff like that, C but we do have, D like, retirement. They kind of match up to, you, if you put six percent, they match up to six percent, C and then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that. It's not bad. D God, I don't know. <laughter> It's probably a long time <laughter>. I'm sure it's not till D like twentyfive years, thirty years. Yeah. F Huh, D well, I guess what we have is like a f, what they call a flex benefits plan where you, you get D like a certain amount of dollars C and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise you can, F uh, <lipsmack> guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it A and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, D you know, put in your paycheck. Yeah <<faint>>, D well, it depends on which company you work for. I know that, D like, the, the, the one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, F uh, D you know, D you, F uh, think you call it plan D <laughter>. < another example like I guess it's alzheimer's > Deductibles are really high, it's D like fifteen hundred dollars, C but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely, if you're f, relatively, F uh, healthy, then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much, amount of money, D you know. C So, the, it, D you know, someone did start a cost benefit analysis, C and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and, and take a loss, what, whatever it happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual <laughter>. F Um. Really? You mean, not even your, your, your car insurance? <Lipsmack> F Oh, that's too bad. Yeah <breathing>, F uh, D well, I don't know, I think other than health insurance, I think, F uh, D you know, an extra week of, F uh, <lipsmack> time off would be nice. I only get two weeks. F Oh, that's nice. We don't get them till, till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week. Yeah, it's, F uh, <Snorting> F Uh, with the telecommunications type of company, supposedly you, used to be much more stable. It's a lot less stable than it used to be. They used to have job security crap, C but now they don't. Yeah, it's the Bell Corps, which is, F uh, Yeah. D So, I don't know, it's, it's, F uh, no longer <laughter>. D So that's what, I think it's still based on the old model of, C and, C and now they don't, F uh, Yeah. Yeah, C but they, no, no longer <laughter>. I don't think so. F Uh, hearing a lo, there's always, they're always laying people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security. F Oh, I don't know, we don't, we haven't been doing layoffs. We've been doing, F uh, down sizing with, F uh, getting rid of extra layers of management. C And, F uh, I don't know what they do for those people. Some of it, yeah. There's too many manage, too many chiefs and not enough Indians C but, D Well, it's about three hundred and fifty people. I guess that's not large compared to some, C but it's big enough. C And they have a, they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything C and I wish they did. D You know, they have a four O one K, C but I put all the money into it. They don't add anything. What about you? Uhhuh. F Oh, that's a pretty good deal. D Now, how long does it take for your contribution to vest? Yeah, the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive. It's D like hundred bucks a, a month or something for a family. Yeah, we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, F uh, they'll basically pay for, F uh, D you know, child care type, F uh, expenses. I can send in a, F uh, can send in a request for payment C and they'll, F uh, C and they'll send me, D you know a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good, D you know. It's, F uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something. Yeah, I guess, F uh, on the other hand, D you know, I, I had a similar, had a similar health plan C and, F uh, one of my kids was in a car accident C and, F uh I had, wound up having to pay for, D you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, D you know, no, no insurance policy happened to cover it, which is, D Well, it, it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here, C and, C and I had a high deductible on the <breathing> on the, F uh, on the c, car insurance C and then s, D you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and <laughter> blew it <laughter>. F Oh, D well. Yeah, yeah my place you get two weeks when you start C and then every, every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. Aye. That's a long time. Yeah, especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in, D you know, companies don't stay afloat that long <laughter>, C and, C and they, D So you work for Bell or something like that? Right. Right. A lifelong job security telephone pioneers of America, all that stuff, F huh. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Right. Is it, E I mean, does it, they must have pretty good severance, though, F huh? Mean the, the, the management they get rid of? F Um. F Oh, they, they put,
