<Clicking>. D Well, I don't know. My grandfather is ninetytwo years old. C And he is still living by himself. My grandmother died a couple of years ago <<mispronounced>>. C But he doesn't want to, to move away. He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. C And he recently had to have an operation C but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home. D Well, he was until this operation. He has arthritis. C And now I don't really think he's doing that well. C And my, a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him. C And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot. C But, F uh, my greatgrandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three. C And, F uh, died six weeks after they put him in the home. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But I don't, E I mean at least, E I mean I think some nursing homes do that. C But I think a lot of nursing homes really, F uh, are guilty of neglect. Uhhuh. D Well, Julie, F uh, are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with, F uh, special care for elderly? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is he able to, F uh, still do everything himself pretty well? F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f, grandfather's feelings. C Because, F uh, <lipsmack> I th, D you know, I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of, <<pause>> do they still have some of their life left. C And C and, for, for, I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over C and I'm just here for the rest of the stay <door>. C And so I, D you know, <sigh> I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, <swallowing> it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their daytoday needs. Yeah they have can look after a lot of things C but there's some of the daytoday needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. F Uh, I know my, none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally <sigh> were able to have someone care for them at home C and they died <cough> <<in background>>. C But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents <laughter>. D Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing <lipsmack>. F Uh, <lipsmack> C but I did, F uh, D you know, I guess, F uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do, take care of themselves physically. F Uh <sigh>, <Inhaling> C And that's, that's difficult part. C Because I think what they often get used as is, F uh, almost like a very high level or longterm care for, F uh, similar to a hospital. <Inhaling> F Uh, I know, D like here in Saskatchewan, we have our <lipsmack> hospital care <noise> the care actually for the older people graded in level, in four levels. C And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires longterm hospital care. Generally are not able to look after this, themselves to very, to a very great extent, physically <inhaling>. Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease <cough> <<background>> or those or, or physical and mental handicaps. F Uh, D you know, where they really require <swallowing> twentyfour hour supervision of some kind <noise>. Even though it may be minimal <inhaling>. C And, F uh, <sigh> <clanging> C but I think that it can be helpful in that, F uh, it gets people the level of physical care they need. F Uh, <Clicking> Yeah. I th, C and I think it happens more in areas where it's, F uh, <lipsmack> I guess, F uh, a broad social medical system <cough> <<background>> where, F uh, D you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing. If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals <lipsmack> C and, C and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding. I think that a majority of the places in the U S, F uh, D you know, there is some government aid available, C but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay <sigh> <clicking>. C And, F uh, if you're not able to look after yourself, then you have to rely,
