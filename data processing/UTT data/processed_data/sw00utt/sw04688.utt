D Well, we, in, in, in our family, have been pretty remiss in trying to, F uh, D you know, keep track of, F uh, daily finances. F Uh, the, F uh, way back, what, twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer, I did what everybody else does, which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks, and, D you know, checkbooks and all this kind of thing C and we kept that going for about a month C and it became so onerous that we gave up on it <laughter>. D You know, C so, F uh, the only thing we're, D you know, that we do now is, F uh, I keep a, a little spread sheet of, F uh, what I call the net worth calculation which is just the, the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth. F Uh, C and I only update that, F oh I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in. D You know. Just to see whether or not we're falling, D you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what. F Uh, that's really about, D you know, the extent of, F uh, of the kind of, F uh, financial score keeping that we're doing. <Throat_clearing>. F Huh. Oh dear, that's terrible. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Are you, are you married? Are you living with a bunch of, with, with people that you're sharing expenses? F Oh, I see, uhhuh. Oh dear. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. F A, F oh, I see. F Oh, sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, you're the first, D you know, F uh, my next door neighbor just lost his job. In a, D you know, one of these, F uh, his company went broke. E I mean went, D you know, bankrupt. D Actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called U S Shoe or something. I, i, it was a computer subsidiary. I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. C But, F uh, D you know, they just <noise> folded it up and, F uh, F uh, told him to, they took the top management and gave them jobs with the, with the corporate, F uh, at the corporate front office C and everybody else was sent packing. <Noise> F Uh, hang on one second I've got F uh, somebody was knocking on my door here. F Uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present, E I mean, it sounds, sounds terrible to say, C but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar, might be. In terms of keeping, keeping score of input and output. Do you have, do you have a computer at home C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see. <Cough>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Have you, do you use a standard, F uh, a standard spread sheet C or E I mean, Uhhuh. That sounds about right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. F Uh <laughter>. D Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, F uh, like most teachers, I'm laid off C and <Laughter> C so, F um, I spend most, D you know, I substitute a lot. C So it's a lot, it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances. C And, C but I know how much I have to bring in a month <laughter>. C And that's about it. That's about as far as we go. C And then anything extra is, D you know, more or less split up between all of us. And just thrown in the kitty, more or less, for a rainy day <laughter>. F Uh, no. I'm a single mother. I have three children. C So, F uh, right now, we're on, we get f, D you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it. C And my exhusband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support <laughter>. C So right now I know what I'm getting from the state C and, F uh, I have to balance, more or less, what I get from the state with my bills and, F uh, D you know, try to work as many days as possible. Any time they call me in. C But I still have to figure out. If I work too many days, then I lose all my state aid C and <laughter> if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills C and it's like a juggling act every single month. D Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in C but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation. C So, D you know, the four days before, they only have a four day week C and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in <laughter>. They don't like to be absent before a vacation. C But we're shopping around as far as, D well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get, F uh, A that's why I'm doing this, to get some extra money. And, F uh, getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts. My kids are in Boy Scouts C so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts C because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me. C So <laughter> it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. C But, D you know, we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I guess we're in the situation that a lot of am, middleclass Americans are in. F Oh, my Lord. Really. Uhhuh. Oh <snorting>. Sure. Right. Uhhuh. Definitely. F Uh, yes we do. C And we try to, D you know, I keep track of every penny. And, more or less, enter it in. Every single day I'm at the computer. C And, it's like, D okay, what do we have left, what do we have to pay, what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, D you know <laughter>.
