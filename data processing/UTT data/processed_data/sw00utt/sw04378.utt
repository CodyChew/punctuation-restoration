Okay. You were helping your parents. Uhhuh. D So you're remodeling? Okay. D Well, I, I just live in a, I live in an apartment now. I, F uh, two summers ago I went to Massachusetts C and I went with a friend of mine C and we undertook a building house. C And this was a, a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions C and it's preconstructed you might say. C And we started in, F uh, we, started from an empty lot with, F uh, trees and stuff on it C and we had to cut them, F uh, down and clear the lot. We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. <Inhaling> Pour the basement and, F uh, went from the ground up. Our one of our main problems was, D well in Massachusetts, I thought I was going to, D well, it was a, a fun time C but I thought, gosh, summer time, D you know. D Well, all it ever did was rain and thunder storms <laughter>. C And <swallowing> one thing is that we're, we had, we were going to pour the basement foundation. C And we're in the process C and it started pouring down rain. C And I guess we had most of it done C but the end was result, what happened was that some of the, the wa, a lot of water settled on the top C and it really didn't give a very good finish C and some of the, it was sort of sandy and and not, F uh, a very good finish. C But it turned, it was okay C and it's only the basement floor C so it was okay. C But, F uh, it kept us pretty busy. It was only, F uh, <clicking> there was, D well me and my friend C and then we just had D like two helpers and F uh, sort of a, a family type, it wasn't, D you know, D like a commercial project or something. It was sort of just, D you know, F uh, gets your, get his, D you know, my bro, my brother and D well, maybe, D you know, my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic <laughter> sometimes. C And, C and then materials coming in <whistling> C and so we're, we're hopping around pretty good. C But overall, D yeah, we got it done C and it's a three bedroom, two bath house C and it's pretty neat. Yeah. D So. D Well, it was, F uh, for my friend's parents. They had some property there C and they'd lived in this, this old, it's sort of like a farm, you might say. C And they live in this old house <swallowing> for something like thirty years or something. C And his mom just wanted a, a new house. D You know, that has been her dream. C And so, we did that. C And, F uh, she was really pleased with it. C So it came really great D so. D So what, why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets <swallowing> very hot. Where you live it gets very hot? C And that's why you, C an, C and the windows have you, what type of windows are you putting in? C Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in, F uh, D you know, the solar game? Have you, what, what, are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or, F Oh, okay. Okay. Uhhuh. Okay. F Oh, these C so you have the sash windows in? Did t, F uh, did it go up and down? F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. Yes, there's a problem with those. Those are, F uh, they usually most of the time don't open very well <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And they also, there, they, they, a lot of vibration C and it causes the glass to crack C and it's a never ending problem. D So. D So I haven't, F uh, I haven't been in any really home repair things lately. I, <Noise> One way or another we're now recording. F Um, F um, F oh, yeah. Home repair. Right. I still am really. They're, F uh, <noise> <<sounds like some sort of machinery>> sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta, in Candler Park. C And, F uh, <inhaling> we've done <sigh> lots to it. We've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them. C And, Uhhuh. How about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <static>. <Talking>. Wow. Wow. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. <Thumping> Nice. Nice. D So, F uh, E I mean what was it for? You just, <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's great. Wow. F Huh? Yeah, it does. F Huh. Right. No. We just, we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass. My parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it. C And, F uh, C but it, see in a lot of the windows? F Uh, <swallowing> it's, the house is eighty years old C and it's had several owners and stuff C and, F uh <talking> <Lipsmack> they have put plastic, Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And so, F uh, C and, C and so we wanted to <rustling> get all new stuff in there. D So. Yeah. Ours didn't <laughter>. C And the ones that would open, F uh, wouldn't want to stay open <rustling>. They wanted to slam shut. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah.
