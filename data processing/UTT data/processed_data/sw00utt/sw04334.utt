Type of music is hot down in Texas? F Oh, okay. F Uh, mostly folk music. Yeah, I find myself, F uh, listening to a lot of, F uh, F uh, either old timer or New England, F uh, dance bands as well as, F uh, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up. Okay. Uhhuh. Yeah, what about, F uh, classic rock type stations. F Oh, okay. D So, some some of the older Eagles stuff was good. I, I didn't like, F uh, they started getting a little more, D you know, the type of music, at least to me, it's, F uh, sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes C and I don't like listening at high volumes. C But, F uh, some of their older s, stuff was, F uh, D you know, quite enjoyable to me. D You know, Ho, Hotel California and that era. Yeah. D Well, down in Texas, F uh, D you know, little, listen to a little country every now and then. I'm sure there's a lot of that down there. <Laughter>. D Well, there, there's a Conway Twitty twang, then there's the, F uh, Dolly Parton, F uh, Hollywood sound. Yeah. Yeah, I think some of them, the artists are even, F uh, hitting the pop charts. Hey, I, I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks. C But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do, late, late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message. Yeah, I, I don't, I don't think Gun, at least to my mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah, i, i, it's the artist, not the merit. Yeah. D Well, I don't know, I know for myself that, F uh, for the most part, I don't know which artist is which, C so I listen to a song, I either like the song C or I don't like it C and then if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it was. D Well, you have to figure out what to buy, C or do you just buy along the same artist? Yeah. Yeah, D so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album, then you stop? Yeah. Yeah, D see, that's one thing I like about the, F uh, some of the folk music scenes, D you know, there's a couple of nice, F uh, small coffee houses up in New Jersey. C And, it's very nice, you go into the coffee house C and, D you know, an artist is there C and very often the artist will have a d, an album C and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album. C So you definitely get to try before you buy. D You know, it, you, you, you don't always quite get it right, F Uh, D well, I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas. I know what's hot down here with me, C so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know, I don't ever listen to the radio C and that's usually what's hot around here D so, D So, what kind of music do you like? Folk music. Uhhuh. D Well, we're on totally different wavelengths. I'm more, F uh, old rock and roll, F uh, some new, newer, D I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type D you know, F uh, Van Halen, that kind of thing. F Uh, I don't listen to the radio at all. We live in a fairly small town, C so F uh, classic rock for me is what I have, which is D like, F uh, Doors, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix. F Uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, D well they, Yeah, yeah that does, that's something you don't, doesn't even sound good loud really. D You know. D You know, definitely. F Uh, D so, anything new you like coming out now, other than folk music, some I might know of. I don't know any folk music at all. Yeah, F oh yeah, here, F Oh, plenty. Way, way more than I can stand down here. <Laughter> I, I don't care for it at all, that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it. I, Yeah, yeah, that's more, even more commercialized for of country music. C But, F uh, it's getting, F uh, F uh, getting pretty big everywhere, as I see it. Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses D so, Yeah, it's, it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is. Concert tours for country and western sings is, it's, it's quite, quite odd, C but, F uh, I don't know, it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think. It's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music, D you know. Yeah, C and that's all it, Yeah. That's what it, Yeah, that's what, what you say, C and, C and then music is wrapped around now. Now, it's the other way around. <Laughter> No, no, they don't have anything really important you want to hear. C But, D you know, it's kind of odd, it's like, it doesn't have to be good, it's just who does it, D you know. You hear a, you hear a Paula Abdul song C and you, C and I think, if somebody else were to play that, D you know, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would think, that's lousy, C but because she did it, it's supposed to be good, D you know, it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do more than anything. Madonna can do anything C and it would be considered good because it's Madonna, D you know. Madonna could start playing folk music C and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it, C so it's, it's, it's really backwards how things are working now C but, Yeah, exactly. D So, I don't know, I, I don't know that that's, I don't think that's a good thing at all, C but that's <laughter>, that's what the, point we've reached, C so I don't know how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way, at least. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's about how I am on popular music. I don't, D you know, you don't, I don't know enough about it because I just listen, F uh, everything I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they play on the radio C so, F Uh, I, yeah, I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time. I don't really switch around to new things very often. It's just, it's, D you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing. F Uh, yeah, generally, C or, about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard C and I listen to it that way, C but as far as, yeah, I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's definitely I,
