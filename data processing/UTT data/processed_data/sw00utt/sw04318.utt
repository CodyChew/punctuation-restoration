Before the one will take, F uh, okay, let's see, I guess, F uh, I can start. I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing. Yeah. F Uh, C so I'm looking at, F uh, something larger than what we have. We've got, D like, an eightyfour Charger that's about gone and a, F uh, an eightynine Horizon. C So, I'm looking for something, F uh, littler bigger, yeah. F Uh, D so we were thinking mini van for a while C and, F uh, we're looking at, F uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well. F Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. D You know, it's, D you know, it, I guess the American cars had a bad reputation C but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, E I mean, e, even if it's just details, it seems like, F uh they, D you know, I j, there's a door seal that s, doesn't quite seal C and you have to take it back every once in a while. It's clearly just a, a design problem there. Uhhuh. F Oh, like a Miata or something like that? F Um. Interesting. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, D you know, size and safety, and then mileage. Probably, F Uh, Yeah. Yeah I c, I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, D you know, price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess, C but it, D you know depends on what you, what you pay initially. C But, D you know I've got a hundred and twentyfive thousand miles on the Charger. D Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage C and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton. It's, D you know, we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles, C but F uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine <laughter>, with it, C so, C But, F uh, F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's interesting. C But, yeah, it, it's hard to beat some of the, F uh, D like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, D like a ninetyone Corsica, F uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction, C but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, D you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put D you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it C and you can get those for D like eight thousand bucks if you, Yeah, C because I guess, F uh, E I mean, D well, ninetytwo's, granted, but the new ones, D you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot, C so all the depreciation has been taken off C and, s, the dealer comes out okay D you know, I don't know what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it, C but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it C and <laughter>, C So, C but, F uh, I don't know, we keep looking at that mini van. It's just, D you know, we can get a, D like a Caravan for, at twelve, five C but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now. C But, F uh, F uh, it's interesting, C but, F uh, I don't know, if, if, F uh, it seems to be, Are you really? Uhhuh, which are both kind of small. Uhhuh. Are you looking for an American car C or, you open to buying foreign cars? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Personally, I have a Japanese car right now, C and I really like it a lot. F Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars C and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, F uh, D you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now, C but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, F uh, car manufacturers have for a while. If I were to buy another car, I would be, F uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car, C but I would also look at American cars, C but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also C and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product. D So, if I were, Right. Right, it is. F Uh, I'm kind of, right now, the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car. I would really like to have a sports car. F Uh <throat_clearing>, I don't really, I don't have a family, C so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, F uh, <throat_clearing> haul people around in. C So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, F uh, D Well, I like the Miata, C but I don't like it enough to buy it. I would buy something, D actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car. C But, F uh, something along that lines. F Uh, C because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay, C but F uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better. Right. Right. That's, when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage, C and I was looking for, F uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was g, that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money. D So, Right, exactly. Yeah. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. Okay. F Uh, I've had, F uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, C and, C and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once C and, C and I never had a problem with it, C but, F uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point C and I, I had driven it a few times C and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge <laughter> j, just from, D well, actually, I had a, F uh, a Dodge Omni at one point C and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, F uh, car. D So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car. Uhhuh. Right. <Throat_clearing>. Which is a good deal. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah that, <Laughter> Yeah, I'm sure they did. Uhhuh. Right.
