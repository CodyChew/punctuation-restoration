No, we don't have the, F uh, national public radio in, in my area. I can hear it at the, F uh, F uh, F oh, the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away, C but the F M signal doesn't reach this far. F Uh, I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit. It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, F uh, when you hear it from, D say, a European point of view, or from the country of origin. F Uh, I agree with you, too, on the, F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS. F Uh, I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper F uh, which is why I rely on shortwave and, and then the cable, cable, C N N. I think a lot of it is just, F uh, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, F uh, in a lot of cases from, D say, conflicts C or, C or it's not happening in your backyard C so it's, it's more of a, it's not as a personal, F uh, the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than, than what's on shortwave. It's, B B C is, F uh, A oh, I don't know the right word, is, is almost, F uh, they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it C and it just, they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions. F Uh, very much so, very much so, C and I, I think a lot of it is, F uh, especially T V news, they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to, F uh, F oh, to really decipher the news and to really explain it. E I mean, I, D you know, I think it's important to interpret it, C but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to, to do the interpreting. F Oh, I like the straight reporting. F Uh, C and then I, I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it. It's, it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it F uh, I always think it's humorous when, when the President gives the State of the Union and, F uh, for thirty minutes C and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard. C And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they, what they write into it. C So I, overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting. <Static>. Yeah, I, I think people are, people have that opinion. They, they want to sit down in front of the TV and, F uh, or at a, read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs, F uh, and, and find out every, I, F uh, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio. F Uh, that is one of my big sources for current events information. F Uh, I really like that coverage. My wife, F uh, on the other hand is home most of the day C and she watches a lot of the cable news network. Have you seen, F uh, h, have you, F uh, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Cough>. I'm, F uh, interested in the, in the shortwave aspect of it. F Uh, how do you find that the, the coverage from other places in the world <squeak>, F uh, compares with the American coverage of, how do you think that, F uh, the viewpoints differ? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do you think, then, that, F uh, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts? <Cough>. Uhhuh. Which, F uh, which approach do you find to be, F uh, more useful, the, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. One of the things that I found interesting last year during the, F uh, the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, F uh, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, F uh, some of the things that were available. F Uh, there was a, there was, F uh, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely, F uh, F uh, hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory, C and while he was being severely, F uh, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda, C but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, th, D you know, this isn't a baby milk factory, how could he say it was, F uh, I, I think that, that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them.
