Okay. D So, What kind of experience do you, do you have, then with child care? Does it say something? Okay <beep>. <<long pause>> D Well, Does it usually make a recording or s, Okay. Okay. Uhhuh. I have three. Uhhuh. Yeah, I do <laughter>. Yes, F uh, I don't work, though, C but I used to work and, when I had two children. I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit, C but I don't envy anybody who's in that <laughter> situation to find day care. C But, does your sister live in a big community? Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Wow. How lucky <laughter>. I, I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, D like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids C and, C but, the community I'm in is not a real large one, C so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, D you know, you either know them or know somebody who knows them <laughter>, to get to, Yeah, to get references and that, C so, C but, F uh, I, I d, don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply because there's so many kids and so many <sniffing> <throat_clearing>, Yeah, C and, F uh, D you know, colds and things like that <laughter> get spread real easy and things, C but, C and they're expensive C and, <lipsmack> course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, D you know, where they teach them academic things. C Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that, C but, take a long time to find the right place <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, when he starts toddling around and stuff. Yeah. Uhhuh. It would be hard, I think it would be kind of stressful. It would be nice to have him around C but, F uh, seems like, D you know, goll, what if he cried at the wrong time <laughter> C or the phone rang or, D you know, at the wrong time <laughter>. C But, Uhhuh. D Well, when you have kids, will you work? Do you work now? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah. D Actually, I teach my kids at home, C so I'm here all the time. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. D So, Not, it depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states, F uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet, <laughter> say that C and I'm not a certified teacher. I went to college, C but I, D you know, C but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now C and so, One of them was for a couple of years C and so, D you know, my oldest, he was, C and then my youngest two have never been. D So D anyway, C but we don't, I guess, I think, F uh, I wonder if that worked. I think it usually does. You might try, F uh, I don't know, hold it down a little longer, C and see if it, F uh, Okay I, D Well, I don't remember. It seemed like it did, C but <laughter> it might not. I guess I guess we can start. F Uh, No, I don't, I don't have any kids. I, F uh, my sister has a, she just had a baby, he's about five months old C and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different, do you have kids? F Oh, really? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, yeah she lives, it's a, it's a fairly large community. She, F uh, got real lucky, though. He had a boss who, F uh, moved into a larger office C and she's able to take her baby to work with her. C And it's a small office that she works in C and, F uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office, C and it's just one lawyer C and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office. There's no one else that works there. C And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby, C so it works out pretty good for her. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, C so it's fairly safe. Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, C and you, C and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the right place or not. Anything, I guess, could happen. C Because after, I guess after he, D you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. Yeah. When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him C and he starts crawling that's, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. I think she has problems with that, too. I don't know that's something I've considered. F Uh, I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. Is that what you do? F Oh, C so they don't go to school. Is it like, F uh, F oh, what's that called, it's, F uh, correspondence school, they do it at home. That's interesting. Do you have to have any special training? C So they haven't been to public schools at all. F Um. C So, you've never had,
