Okay Karen. You, you're first. Uhhuh. Okay. Yeah. I guess one of the differences I see is, F uh, working for a university, F uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, F uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association C so there is a progressive path, C but <inhaling> not being in the D say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people F uh, D like really, Yeah, somewhat that, C but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, F uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances. F Uh, C so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution, F uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance C and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, <swallowing> perhaps somewhat even with the business, F uh. C But I agree, D you know, the, F uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, F uh, security aspect for long term employment, F uh, Job security, yes. Uhhuh. <Inhaling> Yeah, we are seeing that here as well. D Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs. F Uh, D so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, F uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do. C But, Yeah, C and institutionally, like here at the university, F oh if there is a cut back, D well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed, it's where it's most expedient which, D Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles. D So we, It's very easy. Yeah. Right. C Because it's support people that are providing the speed for it. <Inhaling>. D Well the, F uh, that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess. Yeah, C because my perspective is from an institution, <inhaling> F uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe C but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for <noise> I guess in, innovation, although he, D you know, the more complex your structure the, F uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through C but, F uh, I think there is, F uh, <inhaling> it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, F uh, things can happen much more quickly C and so you can see the reward of the efforts. Right. Yeah. You end up being your own person C and, F uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, D well then that's their problem C and D you know you really, Yeah. Yeah. It becomes the organization instead of person being D you know a part of the individual themselves. Okay. I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. D You know, not to get in, D like in a dead end job. C And plus, for me, it's, F uh, E I mean D like medical and D you know, F uh, benefits and dental. They're also important. F Um. F Um. Are they D like pretty much train for a specific job C and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, D you know that's interesting though. C Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore. I use to think that, D you know, after you work, you mean security, job security? F Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago, C but I don't know if it is so much anymore. In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess. C But, F uh, it wasn't necessarily, E I mean, D you know, some people had been there a long time. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No doubt yeah. Expedient, yeah that's exactly it. Yeah, where the most dollar, where, where D you know it cuts back the most. Oh. Oh. D See, yeah. Yeah. I think that's one of the things too. You get too many management people, D you know. Yeah C and it's very easy for them to say, F oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done D you know. C And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time. <laughter> D Well, those people aren't there anymore. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but, D so what else do you think is important? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think probably in a small, yeah, I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing. You probably have a better team, F uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere. Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. whereas D yeah in a smaller, I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, D you know. Uhhuh.
