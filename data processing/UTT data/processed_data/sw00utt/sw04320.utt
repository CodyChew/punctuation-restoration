Okay. <Laughter>. D Well, needless to say, here in Washington, D C <laughter> this is the war zone. F Uh, D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. It's, F uh, it's really bad here. F Uh, for example, <throat_clearing> the, F uh, local high school, F uh, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns C and they're starting to, F uh, get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things. D So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, right. That's how they, F uh, they bind themselves together in groups, I guess C and, F uh, D Now, the, interestingly enough, I don't think we have here, a, a lot of gangs, but, F uh, only a couple, F uh of, not a whole large group of them, but, F uh, just a few. Most of them centered around, F uh, drug territory. <Throat_clearing> C And so they're protecting their <laughter> economic interests, I guess. C And, F uh, nowadays the latest thing I've, I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as, F uh, crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of stealing, F uh, cars D like at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up, C and then as you get out of the car, they just, F uh, step up and, F uh, take the keys off of you and drive the car away <laughter> and leave you standing in front of your house. Yeah, that's the, F uh, latest thing. That way there's no damage to the car or anything. They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. Uhhuh. Right. <laughter> Just wait for you to drive to your house, you get out C and they get in <laughter>, off they go with your car. <Breathing> D So it's, F uh, I think they call it car jacking around here <laughter>. <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh, yeah, that's kind of the latest thing, C but <breathing>, every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides, C so it's, <lipsmack> F uh, it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here, we're from, F uh, I'm from Ohio C and my wife's from Florida C so, <Breathing> C And we've just come from twenty years in the military and, F uh, which is an entirely different environment, C so this is a whole new thing for <breathing>, for us to, to have to put up with C and it's, F uh, really scary sometimes. <Throat_clearing>. Right. C And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school C and, F uh, of course, the mayor, F uh, of D C is having a real problem, F uh, trying to, what do you do to, to reduce crime in a, in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody. It's, F uh, I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. I don't know what, what the solution is. F Uh, there's no way they can stop the drugs, C and that's what's causing all the killing. <Throat_clearing> <<faint>>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. C And they see all their friends and neighbors, F uh, Yeah, C and their friends are driving Mercedes C and, so it's actually, they grow up with that as their way of life C and, F uh, I think, F uh, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. Right <laughter> exactly, C so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes C and they they say, D well, it's, it's the law that's, F uh, got to be changed instead of their way of life, C so, I don't know, it's <lipsmack>, I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to <breathing> <laughter> come up with an answer to because it's not easy. Uhhuh. Right. They've always been with us. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Right. D So how serious is the, subject of crime in your area? <Laughter>. Jeez. D Well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here. F Uh, San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. F Uh, C but it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, F uh, outlying agricultural towns. F Uh, because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, F uh, largely around the Hispanic core. F Uh, it seems to be that, F uh, gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of <noise> poverty conditions. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, that's efficient. They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort. <Laughter>. Wow. Yeah, yeah, I'd heard that phrase. Uhhuh. Yeah, there aren't that many, places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, <Breathing> there's a couple of things that I've heard, F uh, most of them are fairly, F uh, radical in terms of what you'd have to do. F Uh, course the, <scratching> the reason that, that these kids tend to, to turn toward the drugs and everything else s, seems to be just, D you know, the, the, the end results of, of poverty and, and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else C because, E I mean, D you know, the parents aren't making a living at anything. F Uh, C And they're accidental parents half the time anyway. It's illegal, C but it's not wrong because all their friends do it. Yeah. D Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of, of an actual solution to the problem. F Uh the, the social, the other social problems wouldn't, wouldn't go away. F Uh, E I mean, there's, there's been a lot of, F uh, C and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus, C but then, the more I thought about it, the more sense it made, is that, F uh, alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else. F Uh, C and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow,
