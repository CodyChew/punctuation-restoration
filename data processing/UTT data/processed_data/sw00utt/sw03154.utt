Okay. D Well, let's see, D well, we keep our paper, paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, glass and, F uh, plastics C and, F uh, we make the dump over to the WalMart bins there as soon as they're full. I guess we collect m, milk cartons and whatever p, other plastics are acceptable. No, no, I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet. Right. D Well, no, I haven't seen any, C so I, I thought that it all, had all been delayed several times. C So I have no idea what they look like C and, I'm kind of anxious to see them. F Oh, right. Right. Right. Oh. F Oh, of course. That, they did. D You know D actually, we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles C and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house. You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed C and so you just put the empty ones back out there C and he took them away and put, D you know, put another gallon of glass, glass bottle in there. D So, F uh, yeah, Right, right, it would be nice, it would be nice to see it take a good turn here. It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away C so I hope that this time it, it stays. Just, To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing. D So, F uh, D you know, we, when we go dump, D actually when we go dump our things, F oh, we collect newspapers, too, and then take them, seems like there's a pretty well, there's a p, pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics C so that's kind of encouraging. I didn't know, D you know, I didn't know if we started to do that. I didn't know what to expect. Right. <Laughter> D Well, I guess they will shortly. I, F uh, F Oh, right. <Breathing>. Yeah. Right. Do you know, I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the, F uh, the small Coke bottles. C And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not. They were glass, they were the glass, F uh, D well, let's see, they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. Sort of a small size, sort of a small size and, and we, anyway we just, we didn't stop and look them, look at them a long time C but, C and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, D you know, F uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing. Right, right, D so, I hadn't seen that in a long time. Yeah, yeah, D well, No, he doesn't like the paper sacks C and, F uh, C but he, C but, D you know, he likes to pick the grass up, too. He doesn't, Doesn't, <Laughter>. Right, right. That's nice. I guess they dump it the same place, I wonder where they dump that. Yeah, yeah, D well they must, they must keep it separate if they have this date in. They have this day now, that it's, D you know, separate from the other trash pick up. No. Are you in the part of town where, F uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling? D Well, maybe they don't. I, I know that was supposed to be in May C and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was, <breathing> was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were. Yeah, th, That's going to be interesting because it's, F uh, we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is <breathing>, F uh, I look at our big green containers, C and I say, D well, they work fine C and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors C but it's clearly a place where, F uh, F uh, it will be interesting to see how well that works C and I am, I'm glad the community is doing it. F Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. F Uh, I don't know if, where you grew up in your, what you saw back, F uh, years ago, C but for me the thing that strikes me is I, F uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, D hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, F uh, in the fifties, F uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass C and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time was a lot of money, when you returned them. Pop bottles all had a deposit on them. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D So, F uh, D you know, I look back at, at, F uh, my childhood C and I'd say, D you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now C and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, we're, F uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, F uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well I'll have to say I'm, I'm, the only one I'm good at at this point is the newspaper. F Uh, taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans F uh, getting rid of those, C but on the plastic, I have, F uh, I don't have any habits there yet C and I'm, guess I'm waiting for the city to, to push me in that direction C but, C But, it just seems like on the larger scale that, D you know, the, we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things C and I think if, F uh, if we just start to put, D you know, the nickel deposit on things, like, F uh, was the case years ago that, F uh, it would have more immediate effect, F uh, than, C because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money C and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window C and so outside my little town, we would, F uh, go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something. Yeah. I, D well that's interesting because, they're back to glass, you're saying? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. The carton. The paper carton. Yeah. D Well, I mean the, you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do, we were doing C and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood <breathing>, F uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold, F uh, twentyfour bottles. C And, C and, F uh, F uh, I'm not really say going back to good old days, C but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do <laughter> them now. D Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, D like on the, F uh, grass, I'm, I know your husband, F uh, <breathing> doesn't really like the paper sacks. Yeah. I'm the, I'm the same way because otherwise, F uh, F oh, I'm, I generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal, F uh, Neal's a person who says, I like to pick it up C but I don't believe in throwing it into the, F uh, the landfill, C so I have my compost pile, C but most of us don't have the, F uh, sufficient, lot size to, F uh, to do that. F Uh, C so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on. D Well, there's someplace, D you know, if it's, C because really, when I look at what my grass does in, in actually about twentyfour hours, F uh, knowing what the farmers do in rural areas, they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally, F uh, composts or stores C and, F uh, C so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it C and it will naturally decompose <noise>, F uh, C so you just have to kind of keep in separated C and then, F uh, who knows <noise> how they process it from there and what they turn it into, C but it's certainly usable material. Uhhuh. Right <<pause>>. C But, I, the thing I don't understand about that is, D like when, it's one thing to send grass there, C but I've trimmed trees and other things which, F uh, end up being something that, clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly,
