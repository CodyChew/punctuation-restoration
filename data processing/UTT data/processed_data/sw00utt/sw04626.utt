Okay <laughter>. Yes. Yeah. D Well i, I, I, I feel like, F uh, I am from Mars. E I mean I'm fifty years old C and, F uh, I've been divorced for, F um, eighteen years. C But I've two kids and all. C But I, F uh, I, I've never had a budget C and I don't, F uh, do any planning C and I don't know, I don't, F uh, F uh, I don't have a longterm financial plan. I don't try to control my expenses. C But I'm, I'm glad you're a stranger. C But, really, I'm, I happy, I, I, D well I'm curious how other people live. F Uh, C so maybe we should start with you <laughter>. What do you do? Really? Oh. Maybe they're going to arrest us both. Wow. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. The, F uh, I had a parttime job around, F oh gosh, fifteen years ago, seventysix, C and, F uh, F uh, this was a sort of a career shift at the time C and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that. C And I actually did, my bank account would, F uh, I'd, I, I kept bouncing checks, just at the end of the month C but I, I had miscalculated. I, D well I didn't keep a balance <laughter>. It's one of the problems <<speaks this very faintly>>. I never had to in the past. I always kept plenty of money in my checking account, C but when you're only earning half the salary. Even though I wasn't spending much money, I sometimes I sometimes would just, things would get to tight. F Uh, C and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet C and every time I, F uh, I spent money, E I mean cash mostly, I would, F uh, write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning. C But I would forget to write the things down C and it, that I, I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not <laughter> i, i, in keeping that kind of data. I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. The, F uh, I, i, I have to say that, let's see, at this point on, I don't run out of money. F Uh, C and it, F uh, C a, C and I don't, E I mean someday, if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have C and I, I, I think my strategy if, if I may, i, i, is to, is to not spend money. E I mean I don't have expensive tastes. I don't go out. E I mean I buy a car, D well the last car I got rid of I'd had, it was nineteen years old. Pe, people were embarrassed for me. E I mean it was, it was a good car C and, F Oh, it was great. My, my mechanics loved it because it was an old, it was a sixtyfive Buick C and it just wouldn't stop. F Uh, C and it, I, I just didn't feel the need for a new car. It isn't like I couldn't afford one. F Uh, C and now, E I mean I, I don't, F uh, I tend to eat expensive food. E I mean I don't mind buying a good steak C but for me, I only do that every week or, without even, E I mean, maybe once a month. E I mean you buy a, a tenderloin steak, it costs outrageous, D like twelve dollars a pound. You buy a, a, less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars. To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that. C But, C but I'm just, I'm just saying as a single person, that's, that's a drop in the bucket. C And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it doesn't add up. If you're buying, E I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to. So, so that's, I think, one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have, I don't, I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it, because I'm not interested in that expensive thing. How are you? You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget <laughter>? <Noise>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That sounds kind of like me. About the same thing. Yeah. I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children C and, F uh, we live from hand to mouth <laughter>. We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not, then we <laughter> due for the next month. A couple of times we've tried some things C and they worked C but I'm not disciplined enough <swallowing> to keep doing it. The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and, F uh, took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope C and when the envelope was empty <laughter>, then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area. C And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent. <Swallowing> It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money. C And we did that pretty successfully for about three months C and then we started <laughter> borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope C and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do. <Noise>. <Laughter>. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I even find now D like with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that C and then I forget to take that <laughter> out of my checking account. C And, F uh, C So I, I, I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that, so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there. C And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make. Yeah. <Laughter>. C But it was still running. Uhhuh. <Child_talking>. Yeah. <Laughter> Not very often <noise>. That's right. A lot of,
