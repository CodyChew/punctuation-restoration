<Throat_clearing> Wha, what sort of company do you work for? Do you work for a big or a little place? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. D Well, I, I work for, F uh, actually probably similar kind of place. I work for, F uh, Lincoln Laboratory. F Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech. F Uh, <inhaling> C and, F uh, C so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T. C So it's very much the same kind of place and, F uh the technical institution. F Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, F uh, F uh, what things were important, F uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, F uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, F uh, the challenge of the work and, F uh the working conditions, things like that. I don't know. What are your, F uh, what sorts of things would you consider important? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Now how do you mean that? I know it, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think, F uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, HewlettPackard did that for awhile. They went to a, F uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather than cut, D yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, F uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off. C And I think you can do that for a little while C but I'm, Yeah. F Uh, I work for Georgia Tech. Yes sir. I work for the research facility. F Uh, <talking> C and it's, it's kind of small in a sense C but it, it does have, about, F uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees. C And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small. It just have a lot of different laboratories. The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so. C So that's make up most of the laboratory C so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small. What about yourself? F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. I see. F Oh, okay. Right. F Uh, Uhhuh. <Door> Right. <Inhaling> D Well those and probably the security aspect of it. Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, F uh, you're treated, C and it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person. C Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, D you know, their well being as far as, D you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off. C And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, F uh, I think the company still exists. What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed <door> to just laying people off D you know. That way that, D you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time. C And, F uh, D you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, D you know, other than s, D you know, something like, unemployment is good C but E I mean the company as a whole C because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary C but you are responsible for that company growth. You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par, point that it's at at making profits. C So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, D you know, F uh, neglect or something like that. D You know. C Because it's not a person's fault that, D you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, D you know. I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, D you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com, a company situation. D Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. F Uh, for the bad times of the company. What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. D You know. In that standpoint. Ye, yes, I do. I really do. I think it'd be better that way C and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems C and, D you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. D You know. That's just, that's my views, D you know. Right. Right. Right. D Well at least that would give a person a chance to look D you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance <talking>.
