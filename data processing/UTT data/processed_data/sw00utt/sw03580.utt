F Uh, D well, F uh, to begin, I guess, F uh, space is, F uh, real important, I think, C so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess. D So. F Uh. D So, F uh, C but, F uh, I'm not too uptodate on the space, on the space frontier, C but, F uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now. F Um, Star Wars is not too far <laughter> I don't think. C But, F uh, F Oh, have you. D So what do you know about it. <Laughter>. Really. F Oh, my gosh. Wow. D Well, I don't know. You think you'd, you think you'd, F uh, go up in space if you had a chance? Do you, I think I would just sitting here talking about it, C but if the time came, it'd be real nervous. I'd be scared, scared me worse than Six Flags <laughter> roller coaster. That'd be pretty hairy. <Laughter> Yeah, imagine. Right, right. D So, D well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them. I don't know if we'll ever see that up there. F Oh, really. That's all <laughter> beyond my imagination really. C But, science fiction books, E I mean, you look at the Jetsons, D you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons, C so you never know. Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those, D so, C So you never know what, what may occur, C but as far as me seeing it, D you know, I don't know <laughter>. I don't know, C but I think it's real vital important for the future, D you know generations to come, D so. Yeah. I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, D you know, D like it's more possible, C but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, D you know, when they, Right. Uhhuh. D So did they scratch those, F uh, that Star Wars deal, D you know, they one we was all worried about < the "they" in this sentence should probably be a "the"> Russia and all that? Yeah, C but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not, Right. Yeah, I know, C and then, Yeah, C and we don't know who's handling them now C so that's a whole different story now. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Some crazy hit man over there D so, with those little republican, republics or whatever they splitting it all up now, C and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it, you never know. C But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he. Pretty much. Uhhuh. I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects D so, C But that way, <laughter> you can't never tell that. Kiss some butt, C but, C but, F uh, Yeah, I, I agree it's definitely new frontier stuff. <Laughter>. I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time. Yeah. D Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately. I get on a computer network all the time, C and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time. They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, D you know, are just like science fiction, D you know, it's like they, take off, D you know, C and then they land, with the, with the, D you know, the afterburners are going, D you know, not like space shuttle landing, D you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad. Yeah, it's called V C X or something like that. Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that. F Oh, yeah I think I would. I think that'd be neat. <Laughter>. D Well, D you know, I had a car, F uh, F uh, a tire come off of a car, C so D you know, I, D like I know what it's like to <laughter>, Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home <laughter>. Yeah, they're talking about doing that again, too. Uhhuh. D Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years. Yeah, C and they're going to put, Yeah. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, F uh, it's, it's, it's something definitely that, F uh, D you know, it's, it's, F uh, got the extra little oomph of interest. F Uh. Yeah. Yeah, I wish, F uh, D like, F uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, F uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, D you know, purely commercial C and they'd go up, D you know, and do things C and, Oh. No, it's still probably going, C but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on. F Oh, yeah. D Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, D you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here. C But, F uh, Russia's still going to have missiles, they're still going to be subs and things. Yeah. Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was going to have them. At least that was, D you know, that's what everybody says. F Oh, yeah, yeah, we want only Russia to have them. C And now they're saying, Yeah, yeah, you're a republic, you don't want those, you don't want those.. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. One hopes. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>.
