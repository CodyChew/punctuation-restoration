Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, F uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, F uh, F uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, C but I don't think that it really actually does that. I don't think it deters anybody, because <throat_clearing> most of the time crimes are, F uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences C and they don't think that, F uh, stop and think and say, D well, maybe I shouldn't do this, F uh, because, F uh, I might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards C and then they try and get out of it. <inhaling> C And, F uh, how about you <throat_clearing>? Uhhuh, I do, too, yep. Uhhuh, yeah, you still have to do it. I, I, Uhhuh. C So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Needs to be punished or, F uh, eliminated from society. <Throat_clearing>. Right. And then do it all over again. Uhhuh. Right. Have to agree with you, C and I'm kind of i, in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, F uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, C but, I tend to agree with you that, F uh, we should have it <throat_clearing>. I just, I don't know that it's always effective <laughter>, C but I guess we, F uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, F uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, <inhaling> F uh, Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. <Cough>. Uhhuh, F huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, F uh, <throat_clearing> D like go to prison, F uh, C because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that. Uhhuh. I know they put, F uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. F Uh, <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Um. Uhhuh. D You know, D now, I wonder what you think about this C and, F uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, C but, F uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times <throat_clearing> when they had punishment <inhaling>, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. C So if somebody killed somebody in your family <throat_clearing>, then you had the right to, F uh, A if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, F uh, execute that person. C And I know that, F uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them C and, F uh, <throat_clearing> C but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere <laughter>. That's kind of drastic punishment. Right. Might make you feel better C but <laughter>, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right, because they're a danger to everybody else. F Huh, that's interesting. I have to, F uh agree with that. There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that, F uh, that aren't really a danger to society, F huh, C and, F uh, <Laughter> Right. <Laughter> Right, probably more of them then the other way around <laughter>. Interesting. I don't, I don't, not sure I, I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of, F uh, capital punishment we have here. Uhhuh. D Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted. C And I don't, I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. E I mean E I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer C or, D Well, for some things. I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood, E I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. C And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective. C But, then, D you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. D You know, just, like, for example, F uh, D you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them C and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment. F Uh <breathing>, it is to a certain extent C but I think, I don't know because, I think in s, C and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available. D Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment. C And, C But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance sh, should be investigated. C But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society. C But, C And a lot of people that <laughter> are a danger to society that aren't in prison. D Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment. C And I'm in, I'm from South Carolina.
