Kathy? D So, what is your, F uh, family, what do you usually do as far as budgeting? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. My husband is a finance major also <laughter>. C And, F uh, we kind of have the same plan. F Uh, we have one credit card C and every month we put, F uh, D you know, the same amount in for retirement. F Uh, C and we budget, we're, our, our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby. C So we're, budgeting, F uh, each month, F uh, an allowance for his education starting now. C So that's in our budget every month now. That's the newest addition. C But we too do the same thing as far as, F uh, we have a set amount we take, F oh, one big vacation a year and then maybe, D you know, three small vacations. C So we, D you know, an, exact amount that we spend on that each year. C And, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see. D Like you have a separate account for that then? F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. Does your husband deal in, F uh, stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff? Th, does he invest in that and for longterm? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really. C Because you're, you've, you've sat down with a piece of paper <laughter> and said D well let's see what are we going to, D so what goes into that, that particular thing? It's vacations, Christmas. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really. D Well, D you know, F uh, what do you do as far as, I, I take it, do you, F uh, run the family budget as far as, F uh, groceries and that sort of thing? Uhhuh. C And how, what's that? Uhhuh. Do you have a set amount that, that you spend each month C or C or how do you work that? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I do too. I stay home also. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> Yeah. What, what, as far as D like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item, D like for the house. How, do you have D like a household? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Uhhuh. Do you, We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major. C And we have, D you know, we have money that we take out each month that we, F uh, D you know, for food and, and for, for gas and things like that. C And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for, F uh, other things. Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year C and we budget them into what we call our, our needs and wants list. C And so, F uh, the things that, like a vacation. We have a vacation fund. We have a fund for the things we need. And then a, for the things that we want. C And, F uh, C and we're continually putting into those, D you know, each month how much we're going to need C and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item. C So we very rarely buy anything on credit. Everything we buy is paid for. <Laughter>. <Noise> <<sounds like she is slicing something>>. Right. Right. <Noise>. Right. F Uh, we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. F Uh instead of just writing checks for things. If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here. C And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays, that we want to put in for, F uh, the vacation. That we put in for Christmas. D Well, a lot of that, F uh, I don't know how safe it is. <static> I guess, F uh, we keep it all in a safe here at the house. C And so it's actually pulled out. Then we keep our we have a savings account for the kids' <<mispronounced>> education. That money goes into there. Each of our, we have three children. C So they each have their own account. That money is put into each month. He does somewhat. Yeah. He does somewhat. F Uh, we have an investment plan. Yeah. I guess he does. C But, F uh, we have really found, this is the first year we've done it this way. C And we are really saving a lot of money. <Noise>. Christmas, birthdays, F uh, car maintenance, dental, medical, we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental C and, F uh, <swallowing> C and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from, we have it, D you know. C And when, when we see something on sale, F uh, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, D you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Everything's taken care of. C And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought. Yeah <laughter>. I do. Uhhuh. All the money. All the money is turned over to me. Yes. I have a set amount. It's very generous C and I usually have extra. C And so then that can go, F uh, D you know, C either back into our checking account C or I can just carry it over. F Uh, D you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And certain times when that will be left over. C But that's completely up to me how I do that. C And then, F uh, because I don't work. I stay home. C And so it's kind of my money C and I also get my own money to do what I want to. Go to lunches, D you know, and do that kind of thing. We have a clothing, F uh, envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing. <Sigh> It really works out great. We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that. C And we're, Yes. We have a household budget. D Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year. C And also, we need a new bed. C And so we've got both of those budgeted C and we put a certain amount in each month C and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those. C And if we find one on sale before then, then we can just take that and put it towards <breathing>,
