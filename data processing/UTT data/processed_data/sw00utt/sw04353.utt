Huh. Do you all have a budget? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's, F uh, Yeah. I usually, F uh, my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances C and of course, we're ju, like ther, like a lot of people. We just scramble through month to month, D you know. C And, F uh, F Uh, we have a two income F uh family. She also works C and, F uh, C but she, she enjoys it C and she's good at it. F Uh, if it's, if it's, I am kind of, F uh, F uh, I'm pretty bad about procrastinating C and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe <laughter>. You know how that goes, C but, F uh, F uh, if, she, she handles it pretty well. She, F uh she writes all the checks, D you know, once a month. F Uh, sort of on a peripheral. She's, F uh, F uh, an annuity administrator C and so she, F uh, she works for an insurance company. C But, C but she enjoys it. She likes keeping track of all that stuff C and, F uh, Yeah sort of. C And we, D you know, we've experimented with, with, F uh, budgets, D you know from time to time, F uh, C but, if, D you know, you have to keep up with them. C So a lot of times, we just, F uh, just kind of play it by ear. We try to keep our, F uh, <noise> our retirement and our savings kind of automated C so we never see that money. Just D like taken directly. Yeah. C And that, that's kind of handy. Yeah, C because if you don't see it, you don't miss it <laughter>. You don't spend it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do. Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the, the deductions D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <<very faint>>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, about five years. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Uh, I've got one little girl. She's D like, F uh, nineteen months. D So, F uh, she's, she's not, F uh, Not, not really. Not too bad. F Uh. Yeah. Yeah when, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. I'm F uh, I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician. I work at a, for a university. F Uh, Georgia Tech, F uh, research C and, F uh, C So I just, F uh, F Oh, D well <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. D Well, F uh, yeah, we, we do. F Um, we've been married for twentythree years C and we have, F uh, three teenage daughters C and, D you know, they're very expensive. C So, F uh, <smack> F uh, we, D yeah, we have somewhat of, F uh, a system. F Uh, <smack> it's, it's kind of, F uh, D you know, it's kind of hard to explain. We've actually gone, F uh, just recently, to D you know having, having two checking accounts. We always had just one. C And now we are having two. F Uh, it's kind of hard to talk <noise> about this because to me it's very personal. C So, I have to be. That's that's kind of the way I feel about it. Yes. Do you have a two income family or one income? Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D So your wife, Yes. It that what her, is her career, F uh, related to, to finance or accounting? Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so that's sort of related to her field a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. It's just taking it out, D right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We do the same thing. Yeah, if you have something to take it out. That's exactly what we've always done C and we've had, F uh, they've always had, F uh, where they match your funds, D you know, sometimes if you, if you save so much, then they will match it. F Uh, that, D you know, we've done that too. C But, my husband works for an insurance company C and he, he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess. C But he was with another company before that, C but we have, we have, I, I work also, C but I only have a part time job C and I get paid very little C but, F uh, D you know, I try to use that money for food mo, Jim gives me a certain amount money. D You know, we just transfer it into my account C and then I use that for food, household expenses, C and then I add my own check to that C and then with that I try and handle, D you know, some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that, C but the expenses that we need and have around the house. D So. Yeah. Yeah, we D well Jim has, Jim has a budget. I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down. F Uh, D you know. I am given so much mon, money a month, C so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that. C So, I try not to, D you know, we don't, D you know, I don't ask for more. E I mean I just try and make it on that. C Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can just, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have C and, F uh, you can, <noise> you can really waste a lot of money that way. D So, F uh, D well how long have you been married? F Oh, yeah. C So you're just really getting started <laughter>. C So do you have a family too? F Oh yeah. Yeah. She hasn't effected your budget yet really. No. Not like she will later on. You will see that all of a sudden you're paying, you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, D you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do C and then you really have to start saying okay, D now what can we afford D you know, what can we do here C and then you have to really sit down and plan some more C and, F uh, C but I think when we were back at your age, we didn't have much of a budget <Smack> C and then as the girls got older, I think we, we did more and more of that. D You know, more budgeting as as they got older. F Uh, C but F uh, C but what do you do? Do you, F Oh, okay. Oh. D Well good. Good. D Well, we just have, D you know, we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta. I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things. I'd better get back to the subject. C But, F uh, budgeting. I found, D you know, I feel a lot better. D You know, we use to work out of one check book C and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month. Now, I have, know exactly what I'm spending C and it's so much easier,
