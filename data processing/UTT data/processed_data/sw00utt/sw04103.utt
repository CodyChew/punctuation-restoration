F Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, F uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget. The only thing I do now is, F uh, put the data into Quicken. I don't know if you are familiar with that. Uhhuh. F Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, D well, F uh, F uh, not bother to total it C and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic. C So it really helps with that. Uhhuh. D Well, D actually we haven't had to. F Uh, until just recently. I guess we've got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way C so we needed to start doing more of that just for, F uh, D you know, saving for college and things like that. We tried a way, try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that. Uhhuh. F Um. F Um. Sounds good. Yeah, I guess we're, we're just at the point, F uh, my wife worked until we had a family C and then, D you know, now we're just going on the one income C so it's a lot more interesting trying to, F uh, find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, F uh, do it. D You know, kind of enforce the savings. C But, F uh, it will be interesting to see. F Um. F Um. That sounds good. C But, F uh, F uh, I was just curious, what, F uh, part of the country. F Oh, okay. F Uh, Cincinnati, actually. I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, F uh, the western accents or something like that. I don't know how many people are, F uh, getting involved in this C but F uh, D well that's interesting. I'm, F uh, F uh, D actually, F uh, I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, F uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST C or was there another? F Oh, okay. Yeah, that is how I got it as well C but, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, it will be interesting to see what, It would be interesting to see how the data base, D so, D well, I guess we're talking about the experiment. F Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic C but, F uh, it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to, F uh, dollar figures I guess D you know, we could talk about some of the long range goals C and, F Uh, D well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point F uh, I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that. It seems like every year my employer just gives back, D you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement. E I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent C and now it's, F uh, now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class C and, F uh, it's a real shame from what we had before, F uh, because we're, Yeah, I have some friends of mine who use Quicken C and, F uh, I've considered using it once myself, C but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. C So I, I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, it's similar problems C but, F uh, we just have the one check book C and we <inhaling> try to keep it up to date as much as possible C and occasionally we will get behind like you say C but, F uh, <inhaling> it doesn't really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up to date and balanced. D Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances? Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well that's pretty good if you can do that. I know. I have a daughter who's ten C and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point C but, F uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college, C so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall C and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, F uh, took on a full time job, D well almost full time. C So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, F uh, long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing. F Oh, Stockton. How about you? Uhhuh. F Uh, a colleague of mine at, F uh, work got some information over, F uh, the computer network called INTERNET. C And he just forwarded that on to me C and, F uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in C so I sent back mail. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well what other long range goals do you have besides college? Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
