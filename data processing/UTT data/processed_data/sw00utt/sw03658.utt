Okay. That's right. What would we like to say <laughter>. I think, Uhhuh. I think that's what the subject is about. In the Dallas, the MORNING TIMES? I guess I did not. D Well, it's been interesting that we, Yes. D So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, F uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care. C And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it. Which is why people are talking about <laughter>, we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair. You have health insurance? Through your company? F Oh, my goodness. That's must have been hard <breathing>. How was your care at Parkland? C But, yet, Parkland is not free, either. Is it affordable? D So you did have a good experience. Is your wife better, I hope? I'm real sorry. Sure. It does happen, C but it's very sad. D Well so am I. <Laughter> Actually, F uh, I'm a pediatrician C and I feel very strongly about, F uh, children, and, F uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most. C So, F uh, I'm really quite active in trying to, F uh, be proactive at least for children's issues. It's very complex, very complicated, C but, F uh, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids <laughter>, basic health benefits. F Um. D Well, C and the costs have, so much has gone up so much. The cost of immunizations for example, F uh, and just the legal <breathing>, the legal benefits, F uh, that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera. D So, D well, I don't know, it's, it is interesting, in case you didn't know, Texas leads the nation in uninsured children. Thirtyone percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid. C So, F uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care. C And I work in the children's Parkland system C and it's pretty overwhelming to me. C But, F uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county. Okay. Universal health insurance, right? F Uh, D Well, I think universal health insurance, like national health, like what Canada has, Is that what you're, you're thinking the subject is about? Did you read, F uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject? Yeah. F Uh, the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, F uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states C and there's fourteen other, F uh, states that are considering it. Least according to the article in the paper this morning. I think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, F uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need. It's getting to a point that you have to have it, you have to have some form of health insurance. Extremely expensive, though. Uhhuh. D Well, that's the thing, D you know, F uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance. Yeah. I don't think you, F uh, Yes, I do. F Uh, through my company, yes. C But I have been in a situation, F uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year C and my wife developed cancer. We didn't have any insurance. C And it was a go to Parkland type situation. F Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good. F Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, F uh, people, E or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland. No, it's not free, C but, F uh, It's, it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment, it was paid by the county. I had a bad experience as it turned out. F Uh, I was fortunate that there was Parkland. F Uh, no she passed away. That's all right. That happens. Yeah, C but in any event, F uh, I'm in favor of national health. If I had to vote for it. F Oh, is that right? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I, when I grew up and I grew up in south central Kansas, F uh, we had, C and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department C and we had xrays every year, we had a dentist come to our school and, F uh, check our teeth once a year at least. F Uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff. C And, F uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that. We had to pay for it, which I wasn't opposed to paying for it. I had the money to pay for it, C but I'm sure that there were people that don't. Uhhuh. Did not know that. Uhhuh.
