<Beep> <breathing> F Um, what's our topic? Taxes. Right. Right. F Um <laughter>, What do you do? I guess that, E I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. F Uh, D well, no, I can't really complain. I'm a student, F um, C and I d, I work as a coop at, F uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute. C And, F uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, E I mean most of what I pay in taxes C and, F uh, C and, F uh, on, one of my parents is still claiming me. F Huh? Uhhuh. I'm sure <laughter>. <Laughter>. I went, D well I did work, F um, just very for some time C but I didn't make enough money to really <breathing> make, too much of a difference. Right. No, no, I haven't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Oh. Really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, sure. Uhhuh. Wow. <Noise>. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. taxes. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah. No, no, I haven't. F Uh, I, F uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition. D So, F uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that. Physics. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Everybody says that <laughter>. F Huh. <Laughter>. F Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. D Actually, F um, <breathing> the, the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics D so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied. <Laughter>. I doubt about that. Are, are, is America, E I mean are we pretty, pretty steep compared to most countries? No, I don't think so either. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Taxes. Do we pay too much? D Well, do we? F Um, My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there. I pay the, I generally pay the maximum tax bracket. C And, F uh, I think that we're paying too much C because I don't have any children. C And I pay a lot of property taxes. I don't have any, F um, <lipsmack> I don't, D you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services. It, it, D you know <laughter> it's like I have to work m, I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes. C And, F um, y, there's so many people who want a, a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is C and I just, sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes. How about you? Do you pay too much? D Well, when you when you go out into the, F uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly. F Um, you look at your paycheck C and you go, F oh, my gosh where did it all go <laughter>. F Um, what kind of, what kind of, F uh, D well have you pay a lot of in ta, have you been out working and then gone back to school C or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college? To worry about it. Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this? Have you D like worked on political action committees or something like that? I, F uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself. F Um, C but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, F uh, in D C area, F um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress, F um, <lipsmack> Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, D you know, there's a bank that they all bank with, C and I guess it went defunct recently. C And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years al, about a thousand bad checks. C And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho, all those bad checks, no interest, no repayment schedule. C And, F um, it's causing quite a stir up here, because we're so close to D C anyway. It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur. F Um, I, I, I think we pay too much. C And I've, I look at my paycheck C and I make, D well, let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes <Lipsmack> I think I pay fortytwo percent. Fortytwo cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government, C and then they charge me sales tax C and they charge me gasoline taxes, C and they charge me all these others, C and it's just too expensive. I can't believe that I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for. You know what I mean? Do you, have you used, F um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government? What are you studying down there? Physics. F Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field. <Laughter> Scientific. <Laughter> Heavy science. Are you D like in the particle, particle research or <breathing> anything like that C or is it more, F um, applied physics? Okay. D Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward. Actually, I don't think we are. F Um, like, like Europe, F um, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher. D But they do have socialized medicine and things like that. C And, F um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, F um, they're talking, C or maybe it was on the radi,
