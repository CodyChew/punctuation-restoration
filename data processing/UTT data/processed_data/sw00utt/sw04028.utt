Okay, F um, I guess we're going to talk, describe, F uh, job benefits, C and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, does your company have good benefits in that, in that regard? Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see. F Uh, D well I'm, my medical coverage is with an H M O F um, C so, that's, in my opinion, that's get, that's bordering on a health clinic, C but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage. F Um. Uhhuh. Right. Yes. That's right, yeah, I'm, I'm fairly young myself, I've only been, when I first started working which, three years ago is when I first got into full time employment C and, F uh, at that time I immediately joined the H M O, C and I never really, C so the only doctor I, I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O, C and, F uh D you know, for me it's worked out real good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, F um, D like you, you mentioned you work for a school system. I work for, F uh, Georgia Tech in the research branch, C and I guess another one that, that I rank up there high is the, F uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, F um, I enjoy as a benefit. Right yeah, getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Right. D Well, F um, I'm not actually on the teaching faculty, C but we have a large research organization associated with the university, C and that's who I work with. F Um, C and we're given, D you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do. We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study. Right. Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Are there, are there any things that, that you'd like to see changed in terms of the, the benefits? F Uh, I would say the medical, F uh, group insurance area as far as, F uh, covering medical costs for yourself or family members. Yeah, I think, I work for a public school system, district C and, F uh, C so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing, where the school district does, F um, the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of, F uh, costs. C But overall, F um, I've been pleased with it over the years. I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to alter, F uh, D you know, change companies, C or now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any. How about yourself? Uhhuh. Right, yeah. Our district did that for the ninetyone and the ninety school year, E or calendar years, C and I was in the H M O, C and, F um, I was because my, my same doctor, D you know, agreed to be in it for, F uh, they usually sign a contract or something C and, F um, F uh, I did have surgery last summer C and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day, C and I've never seen another bill, C so I I have to say it really works. C But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it. F Uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, D you know, ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for D you know, those people. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, C but if you, D you know, have a family and, and, F um, everybody's gone to different doctors, F uh, it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your, just has, D you know, all the medical history C and you feel comfortable with it. I, I'm sure it would be very stressful C and, my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay. You can continue to go to your own doctor C but your benefits are not as, D you know, good, D so, F uh. F Oh, all right. I do too. Are you talking about D like Spring Break C and, Right. Right. It, it really, F um, I don't think most of our teachers, D now I'm not a teacher, I am a secretarial executive assistant, C but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress <laughter> all, all year long frankly. It is just, Texas has really, F um, D you know, they want everybody educated, no matter what it costs, F uh, C and it, it would be just, we all look forward to, D like in two weeks we have Spring Break, C and I don't know who looks forward to it more, the students or <laughter> the teachers and the staff. What do you do there? Okay. D Well, that's good. Yeah, I would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, F oh, a little luke warm or something C and, F um, it's good that they allow you that. It, F um, as I say, the schools, now we do have to work, D you know, the day, C but we do get many days off, C and, F uh, we all look forward to it. That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college C but at the time, I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs C and, F uh, I've just continued to, F uh, stay there.
