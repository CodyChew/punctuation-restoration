<Clicking> Okay. F Uh, D so your, you, I guess you're probably in the same, F uh, same situation F uh, we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our, our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. C But, F uh, F uh, they're, F Uh, one's twentysix C and the other is, F uh, twenty, twentyone. C So they're, F uh, F uh, They're, they're getting there. D You know, there's no no, no prospects right away for anything to happen. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. <Noise>. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's hard. We, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Huh. Yeah. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. He got sick, yeah. Right. D Well, <Noise>. Guess so, yeah. F Huh. Right. Yeah, a little more flexibility. You can come and go. Yeah. When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, F uh, good, good women who, F uh, would often c, F uh, get them to come to the house. <Child_talking> <talking> <baby_crying>. Uhhuh. How old are your children? Uhhuh <baby_crying>. D Well, they're going to be getting there. Yeah. U, uhhuh. F Oh, I see. I have, F uh, five children. I have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are D like twentythree, twentysix, twentyeight, and twentynine. C And I have three granddaughters right now. C And, F uh, I, F uh, <sigh> one's in Iowa. C And, F uh, she's, she's a teacher C and what she does is she, teaches at a preschool. C And, C and so she kind of, C and they let her bring her, her little daughter in for free. C And then, C so C but she just works parttime. Then I have another daughter in, F uh, Bountiful, Utah C and she has to work fulltime C and it's just tearing her apart. She has a private babysitter. C And, F uh, the baby just screams. E I mean, the baby is D like seventeen months C and she just screams. D Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet D you know. C And, C and then I have my, F uh, F uh, I have a seven month old granddaughter C and, F uh, her mother stays home C and she, they live, they live with us. D You know, in, as Orange County is really expensive. They live with us C and so, of course, we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. C But, F uh, F uh, she just, F uh, she used to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care C and she says after working in there C and, C and, D you know, here she was a provider C but, D you know, there's only so much one person can do. She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a preca, in a p, in a preschool. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. C But it's really, it's really, really very difficult C and, D Well, when, when the, F uh, the first, F uh, ten years, D see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home. C And, F uh, C then after that I, I went to work. C And, F uh, F uh, F uh, a couple of times I just, F uh, F uh, D you know, th, then I had one job C and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job. C And then, C and then D like about, later I, I tried to get the baby to a babysitter. Supposed to be good, F uh, recommended person from the church C and I knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. C But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. E I mean, first of all, F uh, her children were sick all the time. C So when my son stayed over there, he got sick. Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had, right? C And so, F uh, we didn't take her over there until D like about eleven o'clock. C Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t, to kindergarten. C But s, that day, F uh, I was saying now he, he's sick. C And she goes D well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got, D you know. Goes, D well, okay, C so it's not like he's going to infect her kids. C But then what happened was, is, I said, F uh, he just threw up C and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty C so she said D well she'll keep him home C and he'll probably just sleep anyway. D Well, you know, what that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him C and he threw up again C and they put him in the nursery, F uh, they put him in the nurse's office. C And then what happened was, is, D you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my babysitter. Called her C and they said, F uh, <swallowing> that he's sick. D Well she wasn't home. E I mean her, all her kids were sick C but she wasn't home, D right. C And her, C and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. D Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her? No, she didn't do that. C So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, F uh, kindergarten D like about two thirty. C And I had to leave work. It was, it was five o'clock in the evening C and I found out he was still there at school. C And they were calling me C and they said somebody's got to pick him up. C And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in D like two blocks away from the school. I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. C And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't, F uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. I was so furious. I, I quit that job C and I stayed home for awhile longer. Then I went and got a, F uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better. Yeah, C but, F uh, I haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care <child_talking> <talking>.
