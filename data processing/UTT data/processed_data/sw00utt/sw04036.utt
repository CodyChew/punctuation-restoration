I think that, F uh, one, F uh, advantage of having, F uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, F uh, convict someone who, F uh, really shouldn't be convicted. F Um, C and I think that, D you know, a unanimous verdict, F uh, helps to ensure that. I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, F uh, you, F uh, would have a problem, F uh, D you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. Have you ever served on a jury before? F Oh, okay. F Uh, what sorts of cases were they? C So were they criminal or civil? F Oh, okay. What, F uh, what was the verdict? Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? Yeah. C So did it become? Yeah. F Uh. F Uh. C But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, D right? You just needed a majority? What was, what was the other case? That was also civil? Yeah. F Oh, didn't really even count. Yeah. I'm, I'm a college student C so I haven't been, D you know, a jury eligible age for very long F um, C and, F uh, I did get one summons actually at one point, C but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, F uh, a very bad time. Yeah, E I mean, I, I really, I would like to, F uh, to do at some point, F um, C but, I, I haven't. F Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, F um, D you know, maybe is a problem is, F uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now, C but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. How, wha, F Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well? Yeah. F Oh, C so it was just kind of a zoo C and the jurors just sort of, someone had to figure out what was going on? F Um. That's interesting. Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end? E I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, F uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial C or, C So it work, it did end up working out pretty well? The one thing I sometimes wonder about, F um, in civil cases is, F uh, whether, especially sort of in, F uh, maybe D like pro, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, F um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes D you know, it's not just a matter of, F um, of, D you know, did this guy rip off this guy, C and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, F um, D you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, C and I wonder if, F uh, if there's really, F um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, F uh, whatever, F um, D you know, issue is under discussion. In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. C So. Yeah. F Uh. F Oh, C so the deal was that he had, F uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it, C and he hadn't made the payments. Yeah. F Uh, C so they were suing to get it back. F Uh. Yeah. F Uh. Definitely. Uhhuh. F Uh, I have twice. It was a pretty wild experience. They were just, D you know, small time cases where, F uh, trailers and banks were involved, D you know. They were civil. They weren't they weren't any criminal. F Uh, the jury, it was, F uh, A let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people C so it was, they, C and, F uh, the one changed his vote at the end. C So it became unanimous, D you know, after they turned it in C and then he changed his mind after they turned it in C but it then became unanimous. Right. The, the other case was just traffic, the, C and, D you know, it was seat belt law C and it, it didn't even hardly go through, C so. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though. I wouldn't think that it does E I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them, it didn't, D you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, E I mean, the way that I would think that it would go. Yeah, C but it was, D you know, it was, jury was unorganized C and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me. I'm not used to it not being organized, C and I just assumed that it would have been. That's about what it was. Yeah, they, D well they picked one person, C and then he finally, D you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. Yeah, it ended up working all right. Yes. I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on. Yeah, the, the bank was suing them for, F uh, because they went to get the, the trailer that, which was, F uh, seemingly their property. It was on his property. Right. C So they came to get it. C And then when they came to get it, D well, it was on the landlord's property C and he wouldn't let them take it off. C So, C and they are, it was a double wide, C so they'd already taken it apart. C So they left it there C and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. C So they were suing him for the money, C and, D you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,
