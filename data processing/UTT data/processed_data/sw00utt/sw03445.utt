I have been working at, F uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas C and I have watched, F uh, GROSS ANATOMY. Have you seen that one? Okay. C And I don't know I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical school. C But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas. I'm looking forward to it. D Well, Which is movies, correct? Okay. F Um, yeah. I don't like going to see them in the theaters C but outside of that, rent a lot, watch them on T V mostly.

Yeah, D actually I, we saw her just the other night too. Yeah. It's one of our favorite movies. I, I live with, F um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us. We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months. Yeah. Yeah, I like those movies that you watch time and time again. I'm, I'm an electrical engineer. I work in Massachusetts actually. F Um, it's only about, F um, half an hour. I live wi, on the border. That's right. D See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work. <Laughter>. Yeah, I grew up in New Hampshire. It seems, southern town, it's called Portsmouth. It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the Mass, border and five minutes from the main border. We live right in the corner. That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline, I live on one of tho, that little ten mile spot. Not up, F um, where I live C but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad. F Um, D well, I'm, I'm only twentyseven years old C so THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that. That would be pretty good. No, I haven't seen that one. I'm in for it. We rent a lot of movies C so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent? C And we don't know. All right, we'll try that one. Yeah, I did. You too. I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.
