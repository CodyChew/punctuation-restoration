Push my number. Okay. F Oh, I'm a, I play golf C but I don't actually play golf. Yeah. Hack it all over the place? It's sickening, isn't it? Yeah. We've got tons up here C but I don't know. How do you feel about your game? I guess that's a good question? Yeah. Yeah, I like that too. I don't know I try to play, C but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy. I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy. C And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come C and then I got worse again C so. Yeah. That's pretty good. F Um, I'm that and worse. I, I play next year I, actually I take it kind of seriously C but I've been doing so bad. Next year, A I always say this every year, C but next year I'm starting over from scratch. I'm going to go take lessons and everything. I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not. Yeah, what do you do when you're putting? That's a good thing. That's something I could learn actually. That's when I do my worst. I finally get to the green C and I think I'm doing all, all fine C and then, Yeah. Can you really see it though? What about the speed? Can you tell ho, no, C but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit it? Yeah, C but you can feel that? I don't know I have, I can gi, get it within D like, D you know, four or five feet or something C but I don't have enough field. Now I'm T V watching. They make you die at the hole every time. F Oh, it just dies and rolls in. I don't know, it's hard for me. Once you're there, you're all set though. We should play team golf then. I'll get us there C and you put it in. I s, F oh, the T V golfers they do that. It takes them two to get there and two to get it in C so it's fifty percent. C And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in. Yeah. That's good. Joe Pros? That's pretty good. For eighteen? Wow, that's pretty good. I'm talking to the wrong guy. Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen. If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good. I'm usually around a hundred. That's my thing. Around a hundred. D You know, I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole C but it ain't going to happen. D Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time. That's good. I aim, Okay. D So are you a, a, a golfer C or are you a spectator? D Well, I'm the same way. I, I go out there and hit the ball. Yeah. F Um, F uh, D well, in the Carolina's it's, it's just, D you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here. F Uh, D well, E I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all, F uh, F uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot C and he drags me out every now and then C and I, F uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game. I usually when I go out and play golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that, D you know, you, C but, F um, I like watching it on T V. F Uh, D Well, I, I, I, if I can, I can hit a great deal D like, F um, they, they, my friends to get me they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit it up in the air. D So I'm pretty bad C but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, D you know, across the ground, C and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm, C but I'm getting better. I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time. Yeah. F Uh, C so I'm kind of a novice at it. D Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something. C Because I, my, my tee off is not bad, E I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just, that, that initial tee <laughter>. Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really, D you know, checking the ground and, and so forth, D you know. See how it's going to break or whatever. Yeah. If you get, if you get down on the ground you really can. F Um, D well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it C but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, D you know, because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C But I, The, the, it's, it's like I said once I get up on the green I'm fine, C but that, that tee shot, F uh, it, D you know, when teeing off i, I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground C so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole C but, I'm all set. <Laughter>. <Laughter> that sounds good to me. D Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get it there C and, C and then, that's according to the hole C and it ju, F uh, F uh, maybe one or two putts. It's, according to where I'm at on the green. C But the friends I play with, F uh, they play all the time C and, C and they're really good. F Uh, they're not Joe Pros C but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies C so I guess they're pretty good <laughter>. Yeah. For eighteen. Yeah. No, no, no, that's not my golf. That's my friends. Mine, mine, I'm, I'm usually in the eighties or nineties C so I'm, I'm not good <laughter>. D Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it C or I hook it ever single time C and, C and I alternate.
