D Well, my favorite type of music is classical music, C and, F uh, I, I enjoy orchestral classical music C and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano, D you know, C and that's, those are, that's my favorite type. F Uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, F uh, the violin. Yeah, D you know. I guess I enjoy, I enjoy jazz, listening to jazz sometime although I don't feel like I have a good, g, good understanding of it, or a good, a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not, C but, C but, F um, I enjoy it C and, F uh, sometimes I enjoy listening to, F uh, fiddle music. We were in Colorado recently C and heard this, these, F uh, D well, we heard this fiddler C and we bought his, we bought his tape C and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans. C So, F Oh, Chris Xeros. F Oh, you lucky thing. Yeah. F Oh, gosh, Chris Xeros <laughter>. You grew up with his children, too, then? F Oh, gosh. Gosh, small world, F huh? Oh. F Oh gosh.

Of course. Oh. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, C so you've heard the Richardson Symphony? Yeah. <Laughter> Do you have a favorite instrument? Yes. F Oh, did you? Oh. Oh. C And it played by itself? D Well, E I mean, C but you didn't have oboe or something with it? Yeah. Oh. D Well, that's really, yeah that's, I bet that was nice. Oh. Right. Right. Right. D Well D actually, I play, I play the violin in, in a string quartet that often plays at weddings. C So, F um, I always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano. C And, it makes, it makes it nice. It makes, D you know, you can say classy C or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else. Oh. Yeah. F Oh. Now does, does the school in, in your, in your city, does it, does it offer, D like band, or some of the instruments? Okay. Right. Right. Right. Probably. F Oh. Gosh. Yeah. Right. Right, you got a little ways to go, too <laughter>. Right. Hey, F oh. D Well, my, D well my oldest is eight C and, C and she's, we've, started her on piano C so, F uh, C But, that's been, it's been fun, E I mean it's a lot of work to see that she's <barking> prepared C but it's been fun, it's been fun, I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano. I've learned a lot about playing the piano. C And, F uh, it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when I hear it at other places, or when I, D you know, see some, see and hear someone playing. I sort of watch their technique, too, and, and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning. C So, it's been fun. D Well, F Oh, D well my favorite, D well, I, I don't really have a favorite, I, I like everything basically. F Um, I guess if I had to pick, it would be D like pop, I would think, C but I like everything. C So, it's kind of hard to choose sometimes. Uhhuh. Yeah. I grew up next door to, F uh, the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader C so, Yeah. C So, we used to go and listen to them all the time C and, my parents still do. D So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and, and what not. C Plus my parents are, D well, especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music C and he introduced my brother and I both, to a lot of it. C So, <Laughter>. Yeah. Sure did. Yeah. We all went to high school together C and, F uh, C and we're still in contact with each other. We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not C so, F Oh really? It is a small world isn't it? <Children> Yeah, he's a pretty nice guy. Yeah, <laughter> D well I never I had to work for him C and I never would want to work for him. C So <laughter>, Yeah, he sure is, he just became a grandfather. F Uh, uhhuh. Yeah, they just had the baby's christening C so, It was really nice so <<very faint>>, He's a little boy <children>. I can't, it, it's a <sigh>, F oh gosh, it's like <children> Elijah, or something like that. I keep forgetting, what, what she named him. His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for for her daddy, C but <breathing>, I think it's Elijah <children>. It starts with an E. I can't remember <laughter> <children> <noise>. Yes. Yeah, we've heard them and, liked, liked it real well, of course <laughter> <children>. F Um, <sigh> actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord. I really like those, in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding. Yeah. Which was real nice. I got married, F uh, during the Christmas season C and we <children> played, F uh, old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not, C and it was real nice, <children> I liked that a lot. I liked the sound of the harpsichord. No, somebody played it <children>. No, no, no, no, no. Just by itself, just by itself. It was real nice. <Children> Yeah. It went well, it was a change, D you know, from your traditional, normal, D you know, stuff, and since it was Christmas time and, and, F uh, we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and, D you know, stuff like that C and so, we did the harpsichord with oldtime traditional Christmas carols, Not, not, D you know, the bouncy, <laughter> D you know sing along kind but some of the old, older ones that some, I don't even, I recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot, C but I didn't recognize the name. D So, it was real nice. F Um. Uhhuh. It does. It really does C and it has such a different sound to it, anyway. It's almost, I don't know the way it vibrates, it's kind of haunting, D you know, on, on some of the notes <children>. It, it's, I, I like it. I don't know how else to explain. C But, we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas, they're, F uh, called Odessa. It's a husband and wife team that we've known for years C and, F uh, we try to <children> make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff, too, C so we've had a lot of stuff, D you know, friends and, and things to do with music that constant, C plus my husband's real big into music, too, C so. He doesn't play anything, C but, he just likes to listen. C And my dad and my kids are now D well, my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast C and, Yeah, D well, my, my oldest is only nine. C So h, he hasn't really gotten into, F um, that yet. They have choir that they go to, D you know, music class that they go to C but, F um, he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet. D So, I think that starts in sixth grade. D So, C but I don't know. He, he's, he, the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums C cause his, my brother plays, C and, F um, I don't, I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not <children>, D you know, it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something, D you know. Yeah, just a little bit <children>. F Uh. Really? Yeah. <Children> I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it C or...
