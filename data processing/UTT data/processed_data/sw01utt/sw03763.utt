Are you there? Okay, D now tell me your favorite team. Yes. Okay. I think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed, C so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers. What are your thinkings on what they can do, what they'll be able to do? D Well, I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down. on his, Yes. C And the Rangers go up a little bit, uhhuh. I think the entire baseball, yeah, they're the ones that probably are paying the highest. C And I think this is absolutely ridiculous. No. That's right. . What I saw on the news today, that Bu, Buechele was back just to visit. I'm awful sorry he's not still. F Oh, I'm sure it was. Pittsburgh. Yeah. Yes, sir. D Well, what do you think of Howse, who is the coach for the pitchers? Yes. His assistant. Uhhuh. I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse. No, no, I really don't. C And I'm not going to stand up, D you know on my, soapbox and say that, C but I'm, not fond of Howse C and I'm not fond of Grieves. Yeah. D Well, I'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is, F um, F uh, doing all right C and I'm sure, D Well <laughter>, <Laughter> F Oh, I know, I know so, C but I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together C and give, F um, <lipsmack> F oh, F uh, Nolan Ryan the support he needs. I understand. D Well, I just <laughter> F oh, I have so many mixed emotions about all this. C But I think with their new stadium, they should go and let, Uhhuh. F Uh, baseball? <Lipsmack> D Well, I've been kind of <breathing>, been intrigued with the Rangers, F uh, more so with, F uh, F uh, their management than anything else. I, I don't follow baseball that, that closely, C but, F uh, D you know, since I live here so close to Arlington, F uh, that's the team that I've been kind of following. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I think that, F uh, D you know, with, F uh, so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money, it's, F um, D you know, I think <breathing> I'm not real sure about th, do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's, F uh, Yeah that, he was willing to come down a little bit and, F uh, if the Rangers will go up a little bit. Yeah, C but a little bit from three, D you know, from thirty million dollars or thirtyfive mil, <breathing> that's a lot of money. Yeah, they are. Uhhuh. C And I really think, I really think that, F uh, that they ought to, I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money. I think they should, F uh, F uh, pay him what his salary is going to be, F uh, and let him, C because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent. C And then, F uh, who knows, if he produces next year, they may have to end up paying him anyway, C but if he doesn't, then his market value will go down C and they can pick him up for, for a lot less than, than they would, F uh, if they paid him the si, D you know, the six million dollars a year this year. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, C but D you know, what, he, that was a great deal for him. Yeah, it was a great deal for him C and, C and, F uh, he just signed on, F uh, I think it was like a five year deal with, F uh Pittsburgh. C So, D you know, he's real happy there. As far as the Rangers are concerned, I think, I think they need some, definitely need some pitching. F Uh, C and so I, D you know I, The pitching coach? D Well, D you know, I was just looking at the news tonight, C and they showed a, a, a black guy that was go, was helping out, F uh, His assistant. C And I think that's a, a great addition. E I mean, he seemed to know what he was doing C and, C and, F uh, F Oh, you don't like Howse, F huh? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Breathing>. <Breathing>. F Oh, Tom Grieve? <Lipsmack> Yeah. I'm, I'm not sure that, F um, that they're ready to get rid of, of, F uh, Tom Grieve yet, C but Howse might be a different, F uh, situation, C and I think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, D you know, some changes in, F uh, pitching coach, maybe C and, F um, You do, F huh? <Laughter> That's contrary to, F uh, popular belief, D you know <laughter>. <Breathing> F Oh, I know <breathing>. D You know, it's too bad that, F uh, it has to be a fortytwo year old guy to, to lead the, F uh, the Rangers, D you know. They need to have some, some young guys that can take the lead C and, C and, F uh, Yeah.
