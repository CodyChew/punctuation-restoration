D Well, what movies have you seen recently, Valerie? F Oh, we haven't seen that one yet. <Laughter> F Oh, it wasn't that good. The most recent one that, F uh, my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER. That was excellent. It was just a really, a really funny movie. At the same time, it had a story line about people trying to find themselves. There were parts that were sad. E I mean, it just ran the gamut of emotion. C And, C but it was just enter, all around entertaining. F Uh, it's still on, to the best of my knowledge. F Oh. F Uh, it's, I think it's less than two hours. We, we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever <laughter>. Yeah, C but this one, it was fairly long. I, I'm guessing probably an hour and fortyfive minutes, maybe. C But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby, F uh, who was the, F oh, Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy. C So we really enjoyed that. Yeah, I think that, F uh, I can highly recommend that movie this, to see. Yeah. F Uh, we generally rent a couple a week. F Uh, in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday. <Laughter>. They get they get taken up at the store, C so, We will rent two or three movies on Thursday C and, F uh, with luck, you'll have one or two that are good. Most of them are a coin flip <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, D well, Quite frequently, we have our grandchildren on the weekends C and, F uh, we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see C and, F Uh, F Uh, generally try to stay in the at least P G range. The, F uh, the oldest is nine, the youngest is three. He doesn't really pay attention. The five year old doesn't have the attention span, either. C But the, the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V <laughter>. D So, Yeah, my wife took, F uh, I think the kids to see that one, C but we can generally find something at the store <baby_crying> for them to watch. The, F uh, F oh, we saw this movie, PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented, F uh last weekend. Harrison Ford. It's, F uh, he is a prosecuting attorney C and, F uh, <baby_crying> another prosecutor in the, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered C and he's trying to find it, C but, course, it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her C so it's, C And it's an extremely long movie. It's, it's over two hours long. Which, F uh, my wife enj, she likes the suspense movies. I enjoy them to a degree. Save that for another day. Yeah. Yeah, I think you, it's, F uh, it's something I think you would enjoy, yes. It, it's like most suspense movies, what was it was on T V recently, <baby_crying> F uh, FATAL ATTRACTION. It's one that, once you've seen it once <baby_crying> C and, F uh, the suspense there is not really <baby_crying>, you really can't see it again D so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened, C so once, once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that, then it's, it's not good for a second watching particularly. At least I don't think so <laughter>. I don't know, we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times <laughter>. It's just slapstick comedy <laughter>. Sit there and laugh, C and, my one grandson and I, my wife can't understand it, C but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE <baby crying> which is another funny one <laughter>. Yeah, we like to laugh <laughter>. I, I have a theory. I like movies for entertainment. I don't want to F uh, go away depressed from watching a movie. Life's depressing enough <laughter>. D Well, I've certainly enjoyed talking with you. Okay, bye. Have a nice weekend. Okay. Bye. Let's see, the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE. D Well, don't bother <laughter>. D Well, F oh, from a woman's point of view and it was very, F uh, chauvinistic as far as women go. F Uh, it was, it was entertaining, C but, yeah, I don't think the general audience would, would go for it. How was that? That is one I've been dying to see. Uhhuh, uhhuh, C and, How long did that movie run? C But, E I mean, time wise, how long, was it two hour C or, Uhhuh. Okay, okay. <Laughter> That always seems to happen when you rent them, D you know <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh, C and, F uh, it, Was it, F oh, good. Uhhuh. F Oh, great. F Oh, D well, I'm looking forward to seeing that one. That was next on our list, C so, F uh, Okay, okay, good deal good deal. Do you rent movies very often, C or, Right. Right. That's exactly right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, right, right. <Laughter> F Oh, gosh. Yeah, yeah. C And we usually have, F oh, <breathing>, we don't get out as much as we like. We have two children, C so we <laughter> occasionally get out to the movies C but, F uh, it's, it's fun, it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What ages are they? Have you found trouble finding movies for them C or, Right. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter> F Uhoh, F uhoh, yeah. They have been doing that. We've been waiting for a, a good movie out this summer for the kids to see. The last one they saw was HOME ALONE C and, F uh, they enjoyed that, C but, F uh, I missed that one. My husband took the kids to see that one C so, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, D well, that's a good deal. Okay, let me think if I have rented that one. Harrison Ford and, how does the story line go? F Oh, okay, we haven't seen that one. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, gosh, F oh, gosh. Uhhuh. I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day, C and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me, C so I thought I better save that one for another day <laughter>. Yeah, C because I think he'd like that one. You enjoyed that one, then. Uhhuh, okay, D well, that's a good one to put on the list. Uhhuh. Right, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, okay. Uhhuh, uhhuh <baby_crying>. I don't think too many of them are anymore. It's, it's a shame, C but, F uh, I know <laughter>. F Oh, no <laughter>. F Oh <groan>. F Oh, gosh. Yeah, we've heard about that one, C but we haven't seen that one either <breathing>. C So, D well, it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies. <Laughter> F Oh, God. Right. Right, right. I agree, I agree. That's for sure <laughter>. D Well, you, too, Jim. Thanks for punching in C and, F uh I hope you see a good movie soon. Okay. Byebye.
