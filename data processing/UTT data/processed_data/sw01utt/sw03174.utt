F Uh, I work at T I C and we have, F uh, of course, started drug testing, F uh, <lipsmack> random drug testing here C and, F uh, I haven't gotten called yet, C but, F uh, I feel that it's probably pre, it's pretty good if, if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs. F Uh, I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I, C but I think our latest sat, statistic said something like ninetynine point nine eight percent were, F uh, testing negative on all the dru, on, on all the testing. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right, I at T I, if you get called in and you test positive for drugs, then you're put on a program C and, F uh, D you know, you go through the program C and then <beep> you're called like six months after you complete the pro, program C and if you test positive, then you're terminated. Yeah, uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. F Oh, C and, of course they can also cause injury to other people. If they're, if they're not, F uh, D you know, fully functional mentally while they're doing their job. They could cause D you know, serious injury to oth, another people. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. D So, Right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. D You know, I think personally I'm for it. There's several reason why I, I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing, they say, runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it. C And, Yes. C And, F oh, yeah, it's very expensive. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. It's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them. C And, F uh, I didn't get a raise this year, C because, nobody in our company got a raise. C But, yet they spend all the money on drug testing C and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. C So, D see, there, D you know, there's different, I don't think that that's, that, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a, a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem C and I know that. C But then, I have other views to it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Their's might not run a thousand dollars. Our, from what I understanding here at T I, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But, no for all the, the pub, F Oh, it's, Do they feel that way? Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> D Well, I, I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to to the drugs. I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it. It's, F uh, I don't know, I don't really liken it to alcohol C but, yet that can be carried to an extreme, too. C So I think it's a good idea C and I think just the idea that D you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're, I don't know that their job would be at risk, C because I think they may put <beep> them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs. I would think that, is that how they do it at T I maybe. That, Uhhuh. D Well, <noise> <lipsmack>, I guess I, I draw a hard line <laughter>, C but, D you know, I would, I'm, I'm in favor of, of that type of thing. That, F uh, you, <laughter> you have people out there that are responsible for certain things C and you expect them to do their job C and it, it is possible that, D you know, that they can't do as good a job, F uh, as they might do. Uhhuh. Right, C and you never know they could just go off the deep end on, on a, on something F uh, that <laughter> whatever they're taking at the time C and, C and it would be, F uh, D you know, out of the question. C Also, I guess you can, D you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds. I sub in the schools <laughter> C so I've, D you know, had a, they they talk a lot about drugs there C and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools. C But, D you know, I think they can test all they want for drugs <laughter> D you know, C and if they need to do that as a condition for employment C and I know many of them are doing it. I know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and WalMart C and I don't know how many others are doing that C and, C and I think that's good because <Laughter> so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their <laughter> life straightened up at an early age C and, F uh, <lipsmack> <breathing>, I don't know, it's just a problem that p, no one is sure just how to handle I think. Really? It's that high? Oh. <Laughter> I didn't realize it was that expensive. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Just lucky to have jobs. Uhhuh. I just, I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period C and Sam's and WalMart are, are owned by the same people he took one for, for, F uh, WalMart for job hiring C and then Sam's called him C and, C and <laughter> he took another one C and I, D you know, I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together. I can see if <breathing>, C because, D you know, if it's a thousand dollars, that's a thousand dollars they wasted. D Well, maybe they run, I don't know, D you know, that's just guessing it. Maybe they run a lot of other tests, C or maybe it's under a health type program that it it, it would catch a lot of things. I, I just can't imagine them screening all these employees, paying a thousand dollars to get them.
