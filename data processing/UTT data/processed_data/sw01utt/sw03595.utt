Arlington, Texas D now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day <laughter>. Yeah. Oh Birmingham. Right. It's funny how many names have been used, F uh, all over the country. D Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years C so mainly, text books. No, F um, C but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones C but, D you know, sometimes biogr, I just read one about Grace Kelley. I love to read about real people. To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories <laughter>. Yeah, it happened. Really? Right. I used to like to read about royalty a lot. I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, <laughter> I think, in Europe. That was my thing for a while. F Oh, really. F Oh, it sounds like fun. Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, D you know Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those. Really? Sounds like something she would write. Yeah, I've heard that she's done real, D you know, her books are really interesting, C and they always sell well. C And, F uh, Yeah, brings it to life. I know, F uh, the Bri, some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their <laughter> royalty. I know, our movie stars. F Oh, right. F Um. F Oh, yes. F Oh, I always like those. Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch? Isn't she fabulous? F Oh, once you st, I don't like to get one of her books C because, I, I just live to read. I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to the book <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. She's just a, I don't know, does she, how often does she come out with them. I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school. D Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear. Yeah, I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think. C And think how rich she is. F Oh, yeah. And then make movies out of some of them. D Well, hers are so involved, C and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, D you know. I do too, D so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers, C but F oh, her books are just incredible. I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you? Yes D well, no, F uh, I really just thought about it now C but there's just, Maybe it's because they take so much in. I don't know. They're so big they're such, D you know, it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie <laughter>. F Oh, I know. It's about one of my favorite movies. No, it had such a bad press, I wasn't too. Uhhuh. Right. Me, either. Do you know anyone that's read it? No, I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either. I think it was on the bestseller list, though for a while. Is that right? <Laughter>. D Well, I never thought about that, C but there is an Arlington, D like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan D you know, C and I was thinking D yeah, C and I was thinking the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama. Yeah, D well, tell me what kind of books have you read? <Laughter>. I was going to say, not fun kind, right? Uhhuh. Yeah, it is, C because D you know that's it's really and truly a true thing. D You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked. Yeah, that was real good. I'm like you, if it's not a heavy biography, D you know I enjoy it. I was trying to think, F uh, I read a, F uh, a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all, C and there was a murder. Yeah, it was some time ago. Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that. It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, D you know. Yeah, in fact I believe it was C because, Uhhuh. I believe. Yeah, I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me, C and I thought, D well, this will be great, C and it was. Uhhuh. D Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, D you know. Yeah, C but D you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, D you know. Our movie stars, C because it's totally different concept to us. I haven't, I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either. I have read, F uh, mostly novels. I went to visit my daughter in Florida C and I took a novel with me, F uh, and read it at Thanksgiving time, C and, F uh, it was, F uh, one of those generation novels, D you know starts out when they're small and continues through generations C and I like that. Yes, I have. F Oh, she is wonderful. <Laughter>. I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I star, I could not put it down. D Well, no, it seems like she doesn't write as often as, F oh, D well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things. She writes the same thing. Yeah, C and, C and they're the same silly things, E I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's, It, it's practically the same thing over and over, D you know. Yeah, wouldn't I, D you know, I'm criticizing her, C and wouldn't I like to have her money C because they go from hardback to paperback C and she has millions of them. Uhhuh. D You know, mini series and so forth, C and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often. I have not seen as many of hers. Uhhuh. I think she does a lot of research, too. Huhuh. No, I don't think so, C and I've often wondered why, haven't you? D You know, I, Yeah. Uhhuh. Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And maybe that turns people off, C but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, D you know. F Uh, have you, F uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet? Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. I was amazed, C because I, in the beginning when it was on, D you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad, C and then when it came out, all I heard was just, F oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it. Huhuh. No. D Well it wouldn't surprise me,
