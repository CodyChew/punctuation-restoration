Sure. I have a Springer Spaniel, C and her name is Thumper. She's about seven or eight years old. I got her for Christmas from my family, and, F uh, back when we lived in Nebraska. I like to hunt, C and, F uh, C so, I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that, F boy, I could just go out and get all kinds of game <laughter>. Yeah, except we live in Plano, Texas now C so <laughter>. Do you have a pet now? F Oh. What kind of cat is it? Uhhuh. Being born outside, you didn't have any problems house training him? That's good. Sure. And older <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town, C and, F uh, we thought that, we have a cat now, C but we thought, D Well, if we ever get another cat, D you know, we'd want something kind of unique, C so, we kind of looked around, C and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats C and we sort of fell in love with the, F uh, Maine Coon cats. They're huge. Oh. I'll be darned. I didn't know that. D Well that's interesting. We kind of like, D well, my family didn't necessarily like, like them as much as I did, C but the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail. I kind of like that, too, C but. <Laughter>. D Well, I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog, C and then I suppose our five minutes will be up. I work for a university, C and I went to, F uh, Omaha, Nebraska to recruit students, C and I had some time off in the afternoon, C so I went to a, a pet shop, C and I saw these little Springer Spaniels C and so I decided, D well, D you know, this would really be a nice dog to have, C so, when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it, C and I said, D You know, this is just a, I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now <laughter>. C And Christmas is coming up, hint, hint, C and so, I had to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university, C and one of the people, F uh, that we went with, F uh, they were friends of ours, C and so, we got to Omaha, C and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog, C and so I got over there, C and she said, F Oh, that's too bad, the dog has already been sold. C And I didn't realize it, C but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog, C and she was in the back room, C and so that night we had a reception for some of the, F uh, potential high school students or college students, C and, C and, F uh, he had the dog the whole time in his room, C and, C and I had no idea. C And so we headed back to Carney that night, C and the dog rode in the car C and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat C and they left the dog in the car, C and I guess while we were inside eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside <laughter> of the car, C and, F uh, finally we made it back to, F uh, to Carney C and, Do you have any? Did it work? <Laughter>. No, right. I, F um, I had a, for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel. I just love them. Her name was Molly, C but she isn't alive any more <inhaling>. We had her for, F um, fifteen years, I think, my family did, and just loved her. She was the greatest, greatest, F um, went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle. Yeah, I have a cat now. He just turned seven, also, <laughter> C and he's, I, F um, got him in Arizona and, when I used to live there, C and he is huge. He is eighteen pounds. Just, F um, I got him, he was, F um, he was born in the wild, D like in a, in a shed and had never been in a building when I got him. C So he, C and he's, he, he must be part, cross part with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky, C but he's a very tame spoiled house cat, D you know, now that I've had him for seven years. No, no he's, yeah, he's great, C and F uh, he's, F uh, he's really spoiled, though <laughter>. C So, C but he's really big, C so, lots of times he, it, he seems to get in fights, C and when he was younger I think he started them, C and now, I think he barely makes it. I think he gets beat up even though he's big, because he's pretty much overweight, and comes home with a few scratches now and then, yeah. F Oh, I've seen them. I yeah, <laughter> I have seen them. They, F um, weren't they, they were D actually, I can't remember, they were used to be used on ships and in, for, for mousers D you know, C so they're very nautical, too <laughter>. Yeah, I just, F uh, I think I'm, I think I'm being accurate in the, in the area of folklore, C but I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to go to a cat show. I'm real, a real cat lover. I'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u, let me <laughter>. He doesn't really like mine, let alone another one. Yeah. Okay. F Um. <Laughter> I know what you mean.
