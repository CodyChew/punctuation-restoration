Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, why was C N N the only, of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it, is that not true? It was unusual not to have the different sources, D you know, of news coverage. Yeah, D well, I know even if you watched A B C, N B C or the other, E I mean, what's the other one, F uh, C B S. They all were, were tapped into C N N. Uhuh. That's the only thing they broadcast C and like you I listened to radio on my job at work. C And all this week they have been having this, F uh, a discussion about that is why, F uh, why C N N was D well, I listen to a Christian radio station. C And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world, F uh, news service C and, F uh, they, it was, you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got, D you know. F Uh, we had some, F uh, some people from our church went to Israel, F uh, just for a, F uh, tour sort of thing. C And I was watching on TV they, they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem, C so we got all fearful for our people, come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it, C and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, D you know, F uh, if the news we're getting is any good. C So <laughter>, Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. Uhhuh <laughter>. D Well I, I find it depressing to watch our, specially TV, D you know, it's just, F uh, local news concentrates, on murders and things like that. I'm from Dallas C and, F uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, F uh, it just really gets me depressed, even to watch it. C So then, you wake up one morning C and you are in war with somebody you don't even, <laughter> even know about it. D So. F Uh, we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, C but I don't, I don't read newspapers <laughter>. Huhuh. Uhhuh. I find it hard to, F uh, follow from one page to another. It's just something I have never developed, F uh, an interest in. C And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it <laughter>. You would be surprised. They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV, D you know t, F uh, selections of the day. I don't know. It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it. D So, you're right, who would steal a newspaper? <<Ice in glass sound in background>> C But, they do. What part of California are you from? F Oh, okay. F Huh, you work for T I? F Huh. Yeah. D Well, I, boy, current events is not a good subject for me. I don't keep up with it that often. This is your first call? <Laughter>. F Oh, really. Yeah. Yeah, D well I, I got into a conversation last night with a lady C and they interrupt at ten, minutes. C So if we've done our three minutes. Let's just let the conversation end and say bye. Nice talking to you too. Byebye. The topic is to discuss the, F uh, sources where I receive news. C And, F uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio, I almost never watch television, as a matter of course C so, I don't get news from television, except during the war, I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good. F Um. Yeah. F Um, I don't know. I guess, F uh, I don't even know why I watched C N N. I guess, I just wanted more news. It's one of the few times I wanted more news than. C B S. Were they? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably, don't affect ninetynine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made. C But, F uh, I, I'm from California C and I can remember being in, F uh, in these earthquakes C and, E I mean they were, they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it seemed, D you know, from anyone else's point of view, C but they get all blown up in the news. F Um, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. D Well, what newspapers, F uh, do you read in Dallas? Don't you? How come? F Huh. Gosh that's, that sounds pretty bad to me. E I mean who would steal a newspaper? F Huh? I see. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, from Los Angeles, <<pause>> C but I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, right now, that's where I am speaking to you from. C But, I grew up in L A I work out here. No, I don't. I work for North Carolina State University. C But, F uh, I know some people at T I, C and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them. D So, I'm in the computer business. D Well. Let's see, I've, I've, I've never done this before, E I mean I've never. This is my first call. Because I just got my password. C So I don't know, are we suppose to, it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes, C but I think we've been talking for three minutes C and nobody has interrupted. I see. Uhhuh. D Well, all right. Nice talking to you. All right, bye.
