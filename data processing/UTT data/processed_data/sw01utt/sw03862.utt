Hello. Hi, my name is Dolphene. I live in Texas. Okay, I work for T I, do, do you also? Okay. F Oh, okay. F uh, you ready to begin? F Oh, okay. <beep> Okay. Yes. D Well, I don't think that F uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there. I, I believe, if I, am in a position, F uh, D like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also, and F uh, or have someone go into their home, D you know and F uh, and look after them. That way. Uhhuh. Right, it's basically, it's more how they feel about it. C And it is like they feel, they are, F uh, A the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away <laughter>. D You know? Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And another thing to think about, F uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here, I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home C and I got to see a lot of the things that they did they, F uh, they had a lot of crafts C and they had a lot of games C and, F uh, they, get together and just do, they they do all sorts of things C and then there some, some of the, F uh, the people that are in there are real, D you know, very nice and friendly to everybody C and, F uh, then there are others that are, F uh, it is just a job C and they just D you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home. F Uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, it is like, wel, the one that I worked in, F uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day, they would just roll themselves around all over the place C and C and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities C and then you would see see some of the others that are were D like distant from the other group C and they they just didn't D like participate together with the others because they had some some, F uh, I guess, F uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that. <Lipsmacking> What, what do you call Alzheimer <<mispronounced>> disease and stuff like that C and they don't, don't, F uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities. Hello. Hi, my name is Pat Johnson C and I live in Te, Texas too. No. No, I live in Dallas. I work for the Dallas school system. We might as well. I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? C And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? Uhhuh. Yes, I would find it very difficult, F uh, to, F uh, place eit, my father or my stepmother F uh, in a place like that. Particularly, since I know how they feel about it. Yes. Yes. I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for, D you know, if you are faced with placing someone. In a place like that, F uh, D you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such C but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference. C And I have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who, D you know, could care for her. C And, F uh, I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about, F uh, her situation. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think it would matter too, F uh, kinds of, F uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts. Because there are some, F uh, who poor things, D you know, don't have, F uh, any real grasp on reality any longer. C And they may be ambulatory, C but they tend to behave like children, small children C and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis. F Uh. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. Yes, Alzheimer, yes. Yes C and that can,
