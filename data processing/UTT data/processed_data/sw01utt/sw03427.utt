D Well what kind of car, F uh, are you thinking of buying next? You like the Chrysler products, do you? Do you really? What year is it? C And why don't you like the Mustang? I'll be darned. D Well, you know the old sayings about Fords, what they stand for. There you go. <Laughter> D Well, F uh. D Well, we've always, F uh, we've always had Oldsmobiles, and, F uh, been very, F uh, happy with Oldsmobiles, C but, F uh, my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang C and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those, F uh, Mitsubishi Eclipses. She real, She likes, F uh, likes those. She has a sister that lives in, F uh, Phoenix that has one and, F uh, really, F uh, enjoys it. D Well, what, F uh, what things do you consider when you buy a car? I see. Yeah, especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time. That makes it very frustrating. Now this is a LeBaron? I sure like the, F uh, convertible, those rag top LeBarons, they really look sporty. <Laughter> D Well, F uh, we always, this last Oldsmobile we bought, F uh, it's an eightyseven, C but we bought it in eightyeight, D you know, right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them C and, F uh, we found that, F uh, we found a real good interest rate, D you know, when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that, they really come down on their prices C and, F uh, F uh, D you know, we looked around at used cars, C and we really couldn't, F uh, afford the payments on a used car, C because, F uh, if you go to the bank and try to get a loan, they want to charge twelve, thirteen percent, D you know, C and we ended up, I think, with D like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car, and the payments. D Well, that's great. Uhhuh. D Well, when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door. Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventyseven. It was a two door Cutlass Supreme, C and, F uh, it just happened that when we looked for our, our new car, they had a thing going with Oldsmobile C and if you'd buy a, a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate, because it was their seventyfifth anniversary. I belie, yeah seventyfifth anniversary. C So in addition to everything else we got off the car, all we had to do is show them our, F uh, papers on our first car, C and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it. C So we, we got a four door this time, C and I sort of went more for the, F uh, the comfort factor, C and, F uh, I liked the smaller cars, C but I'm a bigger person, C and I, I really like comfort, D you know, driving along the road and stuff. Yeah. C And if you try to take anybody, D you know, go to the show or go out for supper, and you go as a foursome, F Uh, more than likely, it's going to be a Chrysler. F Uh, Chrysler LeBaron, yeah. It won't be a Ford. I've got a Ford Mustang now, C and I hate it. <Laughter> Yeah. It's a eightyeight. It's, F um, I've had one problem with it after the other. The pa, the paints peeling off of it, C and there's no reason for it, D you know. Fix or repair daily or find them re, road dead. That, F uh, I, F uh, it's, my electrical system shorted out D like two or three times, C and it's been torn up since April, C and I, C and luckily, everything was under warranty, C so it's only costing D like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed. It would have been D like two thousand <laughter>. Those, those are nice cars. F Um, the gas mileage for one thing, C and I've, I've, I've always had D like stick shift. I want to, the next car I get I want it to be automatic. I, F uh, I, I hate driving anyway, C and then, C and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now. Yeah. C And, D you know, when you work nine to five, or eight to five, and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work, unfortunately. C And I look, C and one of the things with Chrysler right now is, is their, the warranties that they have, C and I, I feel like their, everybody I've talked to that owns one, has, has, has been real pleased with it, C and I like the, the driver's air bag, I like that. F Uh, yeah, D well all Chrysler products has it in there, C but LeBaron would be the next car I get, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I like, I like that too, F huh, C but, F uh, I, I couldn't afford the insurance on one of those <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, that's what I'm paying on mine now. I had to get D like a first time, my dad's always cosigned on, on my, my loans, or whatever, C and this is one, when I bought, I got my Mustang this time was by myself, because I got on my own, or whatever, C and, F um, I had said, they, they said it had to be D like a first time buyer's car or whatever, C and they're charging me unreasonable interest, C but <inhaling> I've got eight more payments C and it's paid for. C But I got it when, I got it when the eightyeights first came out, it's a, it's, it's a good car, E I mean, I got in eightyseven, I guess, in D like November or something like that, C and. Uhhuh. D Well, that's another big factor of mine. Next, next car I get's going to be a four door too. Something with some room. C Because I, F uh, my Mustang is, is, is two door with bucket seats, C and you buy groceries and stuff like that.
