How do you feel about the Viet Nam war? Uhhuh. Yeah, I saw that as well. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, were you ever in Viet Nam C or, F Um, I was much too young, I was born in sixtyseven, C so. F Um, D you know, both my, D well, both my brothers were, F um, draft age, C but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, C so D well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there? Okay. F Um, do you think, E I mean, do you think, our invest, the investment in lives and money was worth it? I totally agree with that. F Um. What, what effects do you think it's had on our country? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think D you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, D you know, that nothing was really addressed, it was, it wasn't, D you know, it was never we, we announced that we were going to war, it was such a gradual and subtle, D you know thi, F um, D you know increasement of, of force that. I vaguely remember we, F um, we had a, we had a, F um, spy ship torpedoed or something. Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Um, C so, F um, do, do, do you think that D like, F uh, F um, for example D like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war that, F uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, F um, D you know, prepare the country for war. Yeah. Okay. F Uh, I wasn't really keeping count. C But I guess, goodbye. Bye. F Huh, D well, F um, D you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, F uh, I just, F uh, went back and rented, F uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM C and, F uh. Got that, F uh, F uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings. I really appreciated the, the whole, F uh, English class where the, F uh, the, F uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, D you know, the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out, what are you going to do? D You know, what for him to finish me off <laughter>. C And, F uh, it, it was, F uh, good to remember the, F uh, that, that kind of Asian philosophy that, F uh. No, no, I was kind of an inbetween, F uh, finally drew a high draft number, C and you? Oh <laughter>. D Well, I, personally, F uh, D you know, F uh, I just went in limbo. I had a passport and was ready to go or F um, out of the country or join special forces, either one. E I mean, I just didn't know. C So, F uh. F Um, yeah, just a second. <Talking> Okay. Sure, D now. D Well, Mark, F um, what was that again? No, not, not really. F Um. Downside. F Um, F uh, D well, the says we should, F uh, go into the grief that, that's there C and, D you know, presidents have always avoided that as a country. C So it's pretty serious, really, D you know, lot of things that aren't being addressed. Yeah. Gulf of Tonkin, F uh, resolution C and was it a dolphin or a torpedo. <laughter> You remember that? Yeah, yeah, only only it was foggy C and finally President Johnson said, D well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo. Isn't that something? Uhhuh. Hey Mark I've got to go, F um. We'll see you. I guess our five minutes are up according to me. Are they to you? Yeah, okay, byebye.
