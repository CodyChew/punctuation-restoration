Supposed to talk about boats. Have you got a boat <noise>? No, I don't. I, I've had one for quite a few years, C but I, I've not had one the last couple of years. C But, it's something I've always enjoyed. Do you, do you like boating? Yeah, C but, F uh, <lipsmack> my children all have been grown for a coup, few years C and we were using it less and less and less, C so we decided to sell it. C And, What's that? F Oh, no, D now I loved having a boat. I loved having it. No, F Oh, okay <laughter>. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Yeah, guy just <noise>, D you know, he needs his weekends free, or to be able to use it or a day during the week or something, C but, <lipsmack> C but, no I guess for the cost of them you don't really, it's hard to get, I don't know, I felt like I got my money's worth out of mine <noise>. I had bought it used <baby_crying> and kept it, <breathing>, F uh, I don't know, ten years and got within, F uh, <lipsmack> three hundred dollars of what, when I sold it, of what I'd paid for it and had it all those years, D you know. C So they hold their, you take care of them <noise>, they hold their value real well. C So, D you know, you couldn't complain about that. No, no, it was a <noise>, F uh, big boat, big ski boat type thing. I had a hundred, hundred sixty horse, F uh, <lipsmack> Murcruiser in it. Inboard outboard. F Oh, I did fish out of it occasionally, C but I'm not too much of a fisherman. C And, F uh, C but I C but I did enjoy owning a boat, would recommend it to anybody. C And, F uh, F uh, <lipsmack>, C but, F uh, C and D now sailing, I've never been sailing. Have you been sailing? Uhhuh. I've never tried. I've always thought, I bet that would be more fun. C But I'd want to be with a skilled sailor <laughter>. C But it, Yeah, D well, I, I've always thought I'd like to. I've never <noise> wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it, D you know. C And, at this stage of the game, I'm not that interested in it anymore. We go out with friends on the, we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon C and <Breathing> parents' next door neighbors have a big barge C and we go out and take them out on their barge. They're getting kind of old C and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often, C so we we get out on the water occasionally, D you know. C But, F uh, F uh, D anyway, it's <noise>, it's, it's fun. I, I do enjoy the lake, C but, F uh, once the children were grown, C and we'd go down there C and I'd get the boat out on the, D you know, Saturday, C and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much. It's such a pretty lake down there. We'd enjoy it so much C and, I'd say, D well, I'm going to leave the boat out, because, F uh, we'll probably do this again tomorrow <laughter>. It got to where the, tomorrow the boat was still sitting there C and we never did go out again C and I'd have to go load it up the next day. C And, F Uh, Mount Vernon. Cypress Springs, Cypress Cr, Creek Springs. Yeah, it's down at Mount Vernon. It's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas. Yeah, it's just a hundred miles from here. No, you go down I, F uh, F uh, you, F uh, you go down, F uh, <lipsmack> yeah, thirty, thirty. It's east of here. East of here. Hundred miles due east of here. C And, F uh, Did you? Where did you all move from? F Oh, did you? How are you liking it? D Well, good. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, I think you'll like it better, C but, of course it's hard when you don't have any family around. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes, it's hard on the f, your folks, too, I know. They're all, yours C and your wife's folks still live in Colorado? Uhhuh. F Uh, there are supposed to be, F uh, some people f, moving down here from Colorado Springs for T I. Yeah, supposed to be. Do you work at T I? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I don't either. My wife does <noise>. C But, it's a good company. C But, D anyway, we're supposed to be talking about boats, C so back to boats. D So, tell me the last time you went for a boat ride. F Oh, my gosh, D now that had to be, that's boating. That had to have been fun. No, I don't, do you? F Oh, really? Yeah, I love them <noise>. D Well, I heard, that's the second happiest <noise> day of your life <noise>, <laughter>. The day you sell your boat. <Laughter>. No, I just heard that. That's just a joke, I guess. First best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it C but, I'd like to have one. I just don't know if I'd have the time to use it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Really? Did you go fishing? F Oh, okay. F Oh, wow. Really? Yeah, I like to fish. F Uh, yeah, I've sailed some. I just like, F uh, fourteen foot Sunfish. Nothing big. Yeah, really. D Well, they offer classes out at, F uh, Ray Hubbard. Yeah. F Oh, okay. Okay. F Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Where is that? Yeah. Okay, that's south of here? Okay. Really? F Huh. What do you take, I Thirtyfive? Thirty. F Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, it just <throat_clearing>, we just moved down here a couple years ago, C so, Colorado Springs. Yeah. F Oh, we love it up there <laughter>. That's where I grew up <noise>. D So, C But, F uh, <noise> we're, we like it down here pretty good. Yeah, especial, we got two kids that are under two C and it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them <laughter>. Yeah. D So, F Oh, really? Yeah, that's right. F Uh, I don't, no. F Uh, a friend of mine's dad is, was a program manager up there <noise> C and he just moved down here to Mc, what do you, I guess it's, he's working in McKinney. Okay. <Laughter>. D Well, actually, I went, F uh, canoeing down the Brazos this weekend. It was fun, it was fun.
