D So do you have any recycling programs there? Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. We've progressed a little bit farther than that. F Um, actually they have, F uh, parts of town, it may have even spread all over the whole town, C and, F um, they will have these green bins C and it's just as standard as a, a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump. C And, F uh, just along with a trash can you have this, this green plastic bin, C and you put your bottles in it and paper and, F uh, D you know, all those things that wh, aluminum. D You know, anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin. C And, F uh, I guess you can al, C and a lot of the restaurants they just have, F uh, places where you can throw away, especially beer places, where you can throw away green bottles, and then the brown bottles. C And, F uh, F oh, I don't know, I guess they're, D you know, clear bottles. C So, F um, D you know a lot of people do have those separated. C And, of course, they have the, F um, dumpsters, F uh, the, the igloos. F Uh, C and they have those strateg, strategically placed around the city. C And, F uh, they're, they're actually going to extend it, I think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes C and, F uh, Yeah, things of that nature. C So, I guess when you live in a bigger city it, it really becomes, F uh, necessary. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, really? F Huh. Yeah, I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, they're doing a real good job of, F uh, separating it here. C And, of course, there D you know you have a specific place to put your paper. C And, F uh, they try to get you to go ahead and separate it, C but they actually have the door to door pickup. F Um, C and it's, F uh, I think it started out to be, F um, just kind of a test, a pilot project. C And it went over so well that they just extended it. C And it's almost, F uh, I don't know if it's done by a private company or not. It may be. C But, F uh, they just go around to each, F uh, door and pick it up. Yeah. Let's see. F Oh, C and every year, of course, the phone books F um, they tell everybody across the city to, F uh, put all their phone books in, F uh, the, F uh, recycle bins. C Because, D you know, phone books are pretty, D well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick. C And sometimes you might have two or three. C So, F uh, that's, that's a big savings right there in itself. Yeah, F huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, the thing about newspapers and paper, recycled paper is actually very expensive. C So, when you see something that's on recycled paper, they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that. It's, F uh, they're not coming out ahead at all. It's, F uh, it's really a cost. Yeah. E I mean it, it sounds good to the public C but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something. D Now, aluminum I don't know. They may be coming out ahead. C But I know, for a fact that the paper, F uh, on that end they're not, <laughter> D you know. It's just good to recycle C but it's, F uh, not to their advantage. C And it costs less. I can't think of anything else. <Laughter> Okay. Uhhuh. D Well, I hope you all, F um, F uh, come along a little farther in the future. It was nice talking to you. Byebye. F Um, I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet. F Uh, we're a pretty small town C and, F uh, the closest thing we have are bins D like out in front of WalMart that show, D you know, plastics, paper liter bottles, et cetera, et cetera. <Lipsmack> Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, that would be good. Yeah, D see, it's not anywhere near that. F Uh, we, D you know, as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans. C But that's as far as we go C because I take them to a girl at work, C and she goes and cashes them in because, D you know, I just I can do that for her C and C and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it. Yeah, D see we don't have anything here in Belton. It's, it's a pretty small little town. Yeah. C So, D you know, that's about all the, that we're doing here. F Uh, they're, F uh, getting a little bit more on, they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle, and what can you recycle and what you can't. Because, D you know, not a lot of people do really know what, D you know, what it's for. Yeah. Uhhuh. Wow, that's excellent. That's good. Yeah. Oh. Yeah, they are. Exactly. Yeah, D see ours just goes in the regular trash. It just, D you know, there's not a whole lot. C And there are, D you know, some places that will set up D you know for old newspapers and stuff. C But usually it's, it, it hasn't caught on yet. I'm hoping it will soon. Yeah. F Huh. I wasn't totally aware of that. D So. Yeah. Yeah. F Huh. D Well, I can't either. Because we're, we're at a very, D you know, beginning stages, C so. We look forward to it to get better. Yeah, me too. You too. Bye.
