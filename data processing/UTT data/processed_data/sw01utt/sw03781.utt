Uhhuh, yeah, they seem to be a part of life <laughter>. Yeah, how do you use them? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I use a few. I, F uh, I watched my grandmother go into debt <laughter> on them C and so I've, C and then I guess my mother, Yeah, C so my mother learned from that C and I guess she taught me <inhaling> to be very, very careful with them. C So basically, F uh, I just keep them, I use them so that I build up a credit rating, D you know. C But, otherwise, F uh, I generally, C and my husband, it turns out, I've just been married seven months, C but he has the same habit C and we just keep a few D you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for something, C but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge. C So that way we keep out of debt C and we keep on top of what we're spending. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's what I feel. C So, Uhhuh. It's really easy, just to forget, D you know, that you, you charged that or charged that. I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come, C but sometimes I forget C and so, D you know, s, a bill will come in C and I'll think, F oh, no I didn't know it was going to be that high. C But so far, I've been able to, we've been able to pay it off every time C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. Have you ever used Discover card? Yeah, I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off <laughter> C but D you know, F Uh, I think Sears originally put it out, C but it's, F uh, it's pretty well taken all over the U S now. E I mean, F uh, I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover. C And there's no annual service fee, which is good. D You know, C and then, F uh, they also give you, they say cash back, F uh, D like at the end of the year. For the amount that I charge, I get two dollars back or something <laughter> C but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back. Yeah, basically. That's it. C And I think the service charge is pretty low, too, C but, I'm not sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think it's best to keep the number down <laughter> that you have. D So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, Do you have anything else to say? Okay <laughter>. I don't think I do either C so, D Well, it was good talking to you. Okay. Have a good evening. Byebye. D Well, I suppose we both have credit cards. Yeah. D Well, I do use them. F Uh, I have a few favorites that I use more than others C and, F uh, I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable. I, I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to. F Uh, C but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you start using more than a few C and, F uh, they all can build up. F Uh, I think they're handy. I just get, F uh, I don't carry a lot of cash with me C and, F uh, I hate writing checks when you go shopping. D Well, do you use credit cards? Uhhuh. Grandmother F huh? Uhhuh. That's good. F Oh that's, That's wonderful. D Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing. It's really, I guess ridiculous to let them keep building. C But I know some people can get, get, D you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah. D Well, that's good. I'm looking, right now I'm k, kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate. It seems that some of them have gotten higher C and, F uh, I saw on T V, they had a program on, F uh, credit cards C and they're supposed to, I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some, some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country. C And I didn't write it down at the time C and then I went and looked and, to see what my visa was C and I think it's eighteen percent or something C so, think I want to find something that has a lower rate. No, I haven't. Is that the one from Sears? Okay. Okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, they give you money back for using your credit card. F Oh I didn't know that. F Um. D Well, D you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards. I worked w, at Sears for over ten years C and, F uh, it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card, another credit card that was accepted, C so, D you know, now they'll take the Discover, C but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard. C But, F uh I never did apply for a Discover card. I just figure with the Visa and American Express, <breathing> I probably have an, I can do enough damage with those two. Uhhuh. Yeah. I've got some that I, D you know, I haven't even used at all, F uh, past few years I probably wouldn't be able to use them. C But, F uh, I, I do like my Dillard's, I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop. C And I do use Dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department stores. C But, D Well, No, not too much more about credit cards <laughter>. Okay D well, Good talking to you Beth. Good luck. You, too. Bye.
