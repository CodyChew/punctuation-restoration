I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling. D Well, lots, right? <Laughter> Finally. D Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, F uh, Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have, F uh, had a huge recycling bin, <lipsmack> over at Resurrection Lutheran Church C and, F uh, <lipsmack> C so we've done that for quite some time, C but since the price of paper has gone down D like it's about a fifth of what it used to be C so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over. D So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano. Do you live in Plano? Okay, yeah. Right. Yes. Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, F uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Right, yeah, we used to take ours there. <Laughter> I know. Right. Right, I'm really glad they do it. F Uh, yeah, I do news, mostly newspapers and, F uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles <laughter>. And aluminum cans some, C but I don't use as many of those. I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out <laughter>. F Uh, ha. Wasting all your time and effort and, Putting it in there. Yeah, yeah. Got your routine down. Yeah. D Well, I guess there are some places, F uh, in the north, in particular that, F uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle C because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight. C So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there. Right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. F Um. Right. <Laughter> Yeah, right. Probably going to throw them in your trash <laughter>. D Well, there are places that take car batteries, C but I wonder if they would take, E I mean, not that it would <laughter>, kind of a pain to, D you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries C but, Yeah, that's true. Right, that's true. F Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, F uh, the truck came by, D well, we all ran out to watch it because, D you know, we'd never <laughter> really seen it pick up our stuff C and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, F uh, scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff C and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, D you know, scanned it, D so I don't know why, what that was reading it for C but, F uh they must be trying to keep track of, D you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess. I don't know. Another, F Ooh, for those who are really cooperating. D Now, that would encourage it. Sure. Sure. C But the garbage, F uh, D now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two. D So that's interesting. F Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen. Uhhuh. C And we c, <breathing> we called the City C and, F uh, <lipsmack> they, they brought us a new one C and they did not charge us. C And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen. Isn't that sad? D You know. C And just, F Oh, C and they must be, D Yeah, really expensive. E I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't, we weren't going to have to pay for it, D you know C but, E I mean, what would somebody do with them. Yes. Right <laughter>. Really, what, what do you do, now? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Okay. Yes, I do. Yeah, C and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins. Have you had yours now? Yeah. F Oh, that's why I asked you. I guess it D you know, it does go in cycles, C and not everyone got theirs right away. C And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, D you know, recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because WalMart collected it. C And, F uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed. C And, of course, I didn't go weekly, C so it became quite a big thing, C and, F uh, Yes, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two. F Uh, ha, C so it was wasting a lot of time. Yeah. Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned. C But, F uh, <lipsmack> D you know, C but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this system under control. Yeah. F Uh, uhhuh. Yeah, I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed in with the recycling. C And, F uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, F uh, <lipsmack> what are some of the things they don't recycle. F Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries, just everyday regular batteries. Supposedly, D you know, leak and, and contaminate the landfills C and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out. C And they don't take, Yeah, that's what happens C because, Yeah. Yeah, yeah, C but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something. F Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items, I'm sure if p, people will have batteries, F uh, D you know, quite often to, to toss out. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, is that right? F Huh. Registering our garbage <laughter>. Yeah. Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective. They've already got all this money out on hiring, F uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them. I'm sure they couldn't afford that. C But F uh, Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, it did? <Breathing> Gosh. F Oh, my goodness. It is sad. D You know, they paid for those things anyway. C Or, our taxes do. Uhhuh.
