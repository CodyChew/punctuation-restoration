C And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend D like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project. <Throat_clearing> D So, yeah, that turned out to be a really good experience for me. F Uh, D well, D see, I went there when I was in high school, actually C and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, F uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.
