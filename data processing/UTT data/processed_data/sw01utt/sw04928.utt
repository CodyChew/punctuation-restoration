D Well my exercise program consists of, F uh, D you know, it's, it's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of, D you know, wasting my, my, the, D you know, the, trying to exist on the latency of my youth, the good health of my youth. I'm, C and what I like to do is I like to stretch out C and I like to run, F uh, m, I'm, I like to run, get my heartbeat up. I like to run about, F oh, about two, two and a half miles. C And then I like to work out on, F uh, on the, F uh, the Bailey Life C, Cycle machines up here at the, at the Holiday Spa. C And, C and I, I think that, D you know, I've had a regiment now for about, D you know, ten, fifteen years of, of doing that C and, F uh, C and I, I kind of think it's, F uh, it's a lot of work C but I think it's, F uh, it's a lot of work C but I think it's, F uh, it's the, F uh, the amount of effort that's required to, F uh, to stay healthy, D you know. I have a sedentary job C and, F uh, unless you do something like that, y, you're going to get sick. D Well, I, F uh, two years ago I started having trouble with my knee. C And, F uh, D you know, I've got, D you know, I figured D well, it'll go away. D Well I s, D you know, I'm, I've had to reduce my program, reduce my program C and I've gained fifteen pounds. C And so, F uh, D you know, it's, e, D you know, I need to get back into swimming, D you know, instead of running. If I can't swim E or I can't run, I should be able to swim. D Well I'm such a terrible swimmer C and I, I, I really feel I can, I can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes f, to this effort. C But if it gets longer than that I, I, i, it, I start not doing anything. C And so, C so I got a real problem in that regard. F Uh, it, do, you obviously are, are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it. D Well, it's, it's always a chore. E I mean I started doing this when I was about thirtyfive C and now I'm fiftyfive. C And, F uh, D you know, I, I know that in, I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some, some piece of nonsense. D Y, you know, some health related thing is going to blow me away. That's the same way, I got too much weight on right now. I need to lose fifty pounds, D you know. I need to lose at least twenty, D you know. C But, F uh, D you know, it's, it's just, F uh, I'm busy. I'm doing a lot of traveling C and, F uh, it, it creates a problem, F uh, D you know, when you're on the road. What sort of, F uh, F uh, what other programs other than say running? Have you, have you ever done anything at all? Uhhuh. club, what club are you with? What club were you with? F Oh. Okay. C So you're, you're down, you're downtown. Okay. Yeah. You're down there on, D you know, twentieth and eighteenth and F G. Oh. D Well, I'd, F uh, D well there's a, there's a Holiday Spa down there on, on K street, I think. Something like that. C But, F uh, I, I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria C and that's pretty good. C But, D you know, evening time it gets pretty busy. C But generally, D you know, I can, I can get in and get a program, D you know. C But, F uh, D you know, I, I need to, I need to rededicate myself to, F uh, to doing this C and, F uh, I got a problem, F uh, D you know, ever since my knee went bad, of getting back solidly into it. E I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen, twenty years. C And, D you know, C and I'm, I know I'm going to get, I know it's going to bite me in the ass C and so I, I really don't want to, want to, F uh, D you know, back off on it. D Well, no. When you're young, you, <noise> you can abuse your, your, all your systems C and you can recover. F Uh, when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems, you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass goodbye, D you know. C And, F uh, C and so the object, <Music> <TV> F Huh. Right. Yeah, I'm, I need to get, I'm, I'm pretty bad about that. I'm lazy. I should, I know I want, I always say that I need to get run, start running C and I'm going to try and do that this summer. C Because I never have time. I, I always put it off. By the time I get back from classes it's late at night C and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever. C Because I'm, I'm getting a gut here. I got to <laughter> get back into shape. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah. E I mean, I do it, I guess, I'm going to do it, F uh, because I want to get in shape. I'm not, it's not something I really enjoy all that much that, I'll, I'll probably, E I mean once I get into it and I, if I, if I get into better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Right. Yeah, I have. F Uh, situps C or, al, also last summer I was doing Nautilus C or last year <cough> I'm, F uh, belong to a club right here. Got kind of expensive, F uh, to r, to r, renew. They wanted another fifty dollars. That was a little bit too much money. C But, F uh, doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that. I'm sorry? It's called, A oh, what was it called <laughter>. City Sports, downtown Washington. Yeah. I'm at, I'm at, I go to George Washington University. Yeah. It's, F uh, Plaza. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's something, I think, F uh, I'm young, I should get started getting into shape. I don't want to, I want, E I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it.. <Cough>. Yeah. F Huh <music> <TV>.
