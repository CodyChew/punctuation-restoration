What kind of car would you like to buy next? D Well, why would that be? Okay, D well that's good. If you had, F uh, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy? Do you? Which type of Cadillac, F uh, is your favorite? The Seville. That's a sharp looking car. That really is. It, it always has been though. D You know, it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness. It never really has. It's always had it's own unique look. D Well, I've always liked <clicking> that. I liked the, the one year they had, a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it. I thought, D now that looks sharp that looks real sharp. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and, F uh, the, I, I've never really, F uh, I've never ridden in one recently, F um, C but they're supposed to be just real smooth. Just a nice comfortable ride. Uhhuh. Right. Now they've got a unique fa, F uh, feature in them now. If, F uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the e, the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, D you know, into the inside. It'll go underneath the car instead. C So that's, that's a big safety factor they've got in them now. The air bags, yeah. D So, D well that's great, that's great, D So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products. Right. What kind of, F uh, <throat_clearing> General Motors cars have you had in the past? Oldsmobiles. Those are real nice riding cars too. <Laughter>. Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra? The NinetyEight, okay. D Well, I don't think, F uh, let's see, the NinetyEight, D now that's got that big V eight engine in it, doesn't it, doesn't it? Has a little V Six? Okay. It, F Oh, that's great that's great. That's always nice to get, F uh, reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending, D you know, anywhere from fifteen to twentyfive thousand dollars for, for a single item. D You know, you just don't want any hassles with it. You just, you expect it to do its, its job, C and I think a lot of, a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consider, don't take that into consideration D you know. They just expect you to buy their product, C but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be D you know. Price is, is an issue, C but it's not the most important issue. Right. D Well, I've always been a Ford man, myself. Yes. C But that's all right. D You know, it's American made too which is good. F Um, C but I, I've, ever since I guess I, I was growing up, my dad's always had Fords, C and, F uh, D well, I grew up in South Dakota. C So everybody has a truck C and my Ford trucks have just, I've, I've just never had problems with them. I honestly think I would die before my truck would, keel over on me. D So. D Well, I guess Cadillac. I guess that's kind of everybody's dream <laughter>. F Oh, I guess it's a General Motors product, C and I like General Motors because they're made in the United States, C and, F uh, we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them. Uhhuh. F Oh, F um, I think I'd still go with the Cadillac. I don't, I don't care about a big fancy, fancy <laughter>. F Oh, I don't know. I guess the Seville, probably or. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they have been. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah. D Well, I think the ones now with all of the, F uh, fancy gold lettering and all, D you know, I think they're very pretty. C And course the top, D now the vin, A what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty. Uhhuh. Yeah, they are, C and, F uh, they, they're just always, they, they look like they're sturdy D you know, they look like they're very sturdy, C and <lipsmack> you don't have to worry that much about, <throat_clearing> F um, getting, D you know, hurt like you would in a small one. F Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, C and I suppose they all have the balloons. The air bags, yeah. D Well. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I do. F Um, I, I go for things, D you know, built in the United States rather than foreign countries. Help our economy C and, Mostly Oldsmobiles. F Oh, yeah. That's what we have now, C but of course if I have a choice I'd still have the Cadillac C but, F uh, I've been very satisfied with the, with the Oldsmobiles. We've driven them for about probably twenty years. F Uh, no, the NinetyEight. Uhhuh, yeah. D So. D Well I don't know. The one we have has a six. Uhhuh. C But it's a very good car. It's a had, not had one minute's problem with it, C and I've had, now I have twentythree thousand miles on it. Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. No, it really isn't, because now you can get D like five year financing on them C and so, F um, C but I, I, I would go with the General Motors any time. F Oh, really. F Oh. Yeah, D well sure. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I, yeah, those are good products also. F Um, let's see,
