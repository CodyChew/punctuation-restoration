F Uh, did you watch the Bulls this morning? They won in a squeaker. They won by they won by two points. F Uh, they were behind as they headed into each quarter C and then they came back in the second half C and at the end, I think they were, F uh, looked, they looked like they were closing it out C and then Detroit kept coming back C and F uh, Isaiah missed a three point attempt, at the end C and, F uh, I think the Bulls won by two. I think they do, as a matter of fact. One of the, F uh, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would, F uh, if they continued at their current pace, F uh, set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season. Yeah, they looked real good C and, Right. Yeah, D well, they, they're, they're balancing their attack C and I think they look like, F uh, they'll repeat, although, F uh, here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors. I saw the, the second half of the game last night C and they were impressive. Billy Owens looks like he was, that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him. D Well, they traded away, F uh, Mitch Richmond, C or is it Tim Hardaway. One of the two, F uh, who, along with, F uh, Chris Mullen was, D you know, though three were three of the best in the N B A, C and C and, they made a heck of a threesome C and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens C and, F uh, Yeah, F oh, yeah, he's really worked out well. They've got th, the Warriors have got a team, F uh, C and, F uh, I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do. They're ahead, C and the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth, F uh, position in the west C and I don't know, in the east, I don't know, F uh, is it Boston in, F uh, first place? Boy, they've had a hard time. They said they've lost a lot of squeakers. Yeah. How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. Do you, for example, like San Antonio in Dallas? C So there isn't much crossover, F huh, y, Yeah. Yeah, it's true, C because s, San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they? No. Is it? Yeah, C so it's not something you'd drive, Yeah, I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing. They've done a good job. E I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him certainly, <Laughter>. Yeah, E I mean, that's I think the way it, F uh, I think that's the way it works now in basketball. D You, you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and, D you know, F uh, Bird for the, for the, F uh, Celtics C and, D Well, it, D Well, yeah. D Well, I think you're right C and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit C and I think those things do make a difference C and there are marquee players. C And I think I think Jordan and the, and the Bulls have to be, F uh, considered the likely favorites. I don't know who would meet them in the west. F Uh, I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year. They were so disap, D You know, I wasn't, I, I d, I watched only a few minutes of it C and I wasn't paying attention. F Uh, C and so I don't know, F uh, C But Phoenix, D you know, Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs C and, You know what, I watched a little bit of, F uh, of the Bulls game C and I, F uh, had to leave. F Uh, in fact I, I think the Bulls were ahead when I, F uh, when I left. Who won the game? Is that right? Uhhuh. <Cough>. <Lipsmack> Wow, they've got the, don't they have the best record now? Yeah. Wow. They, they do, C and they, D you know, I think by, F uh, by relieving some of the pressure off of, F uh, of, F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, Michael Jordan really helped them out. D You know, he doesn't have, they don't have to rely on him to score ev, D you know, thirty or forty points at every at every game C so, F Oh, I know, I'm, yeah, I saw the w, <laughter> I saw the Warriors, F uh, just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors, F uh, Dallas game. They look good. Yeah, D now, I don't, F uh, I haven't kept up with what was going on with, F uh, with the, Uhhuh. Good move. Yeah. F Uh, I think Boston's in first. F Uh, <lipsmack> I, D you know, I haven't kept up with any of the other, F uh, teams. I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks, D you know. F Oh, man! That, D well, yeah, C but, E I mean, just this whole year has been just disastrous for them C and, F uh, D you know, they're going, I, I think they're going for an all time record of how many l, D you know, losses in a row <laughter> they can, they c, they can, F uh, pull out. It's unbelievable. F Uh, D Well, actually, actually, the, the, the Dallas area here, F uh, pulls for Dallas. F Uh, San Antonio pulls for San Antonio, C and Houston pulls for, for the Rockets. There really, E I mean, not a whole lot. D You know, E I mean, d, you find them, they're, find them be, to be pretty loyal, F uh, in, with the local teams. F Uh, D you know, it's kind of, I guess it's kind of like, F uh, there in the Bay area, D you know, you don't find a whole lot of, F uh, of Sacramento fans. Really isn't, uhuh. It's, D you know, it's, it's about the same, F uh, same distance from here to s, to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento. C So it's, D yeah, it's not really a local, D you know, F Uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio C and they, E I mean, they have got a great club. D You know. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah that always makes a big difference. D So, Yeah. C And, D you know, F uh, D you know, I used to think that, that one, one player really doesn't make a club, C but it really does, D you know. You get somebody like Magic C and you can see the decline in that team. Once he left, D you know, it's, it's just not the same, F uh, it's not the same team. There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for. F Oh, yeah. Who won that Portland game? F Uh,
