kay, Dave. What kind of pets do you have? One rotten cat <laughter>. I heard a laugh in the background. <Laughter> Don't you like cats? F Oh yeah. That's odd. How does he treat the <inhaling> other people? Wow. <Laughter> Did he raise him or something? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh, that's interesting. F Huh. We have a, a mutt. D Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from. <Laughter> F Uh, some lady, she, F uh, a lot of people, F uh, F uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house C and she use to work for a veter, veterinarian C so she would spay, F uh, neuter them give them all their shots <noise> C and we saw an ad saying it was free, C so we went down there and picked it up C and it's been an excellent dog, C but it's my first dog I've had C and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work C so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work. F Uh yeah. Right now it, it is. It's kind of good training. E I mean we have been trying for kids, C but right now we haven't had any, C but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes <laughter>. F Uh, my brother has. F Uh, we didn't do a lot with them. F Uh, I never felt like it was mine or anything, you couldn't do anything. C But, E I mean, that did, did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brothers <laughter>. C But, Uhhuh. That's what we found. Ours is, F uh, D like a cockapoo. I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle. C But, it's a really good dog. I don't know, they seem to be, E I mean, listen better or something. Is your cat a purebred? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Would you ever want a dog in the family? Uhhuh. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. He just needed a lot of time. F Oh, we have one rotten cat. <Laughter> Yeah, it's my son's cat. Yeah, that's the boys. <laughter> They know I don't like it. D Well, I like cats. This, this cat is a, F uh, <noise> more like a dog. Yeah he's, F uh, a one owner. He likes one boy in the family and that's about it <meow>. <Breathing> Just, F uh, stays away or runs usually. C But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around. D You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap, C but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing. He's, he, we bought the cat for him C and so he's, F uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him. C But I, I've never owned a cat like that. I've had cats growing up all the time C and <children_talking> D you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody <children_talking>. C So, it's a weird cat <laughter>. A mutt. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now? You feel like. <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. Have, have you had dogs before? Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well, <noise> I just, F uh, we've, D you know when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog C and we had mostly mutts, D well not mutts, but mixes D you know like one or two mix C and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. No. No, it's just F uh an accident <laughter>. From a frie, F uh, from my, my son's friend down the street. They're they're cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens C and <inhaling> C so, F Uh, we, I would. We, F uh, we had a dog that was a, F uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador C and, F uh, I should say a pup C and he was just too big for our kids when we got him C and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, F uh, D you know, was a pet C and it was a dog that we gotten C and he was, he was just too big. F Uh, the kids couldn't handle him C and I was still going to school C and my wife was working C and I was working C and so we just didn't have time to really train him C so he was kind of jus, D you know, he was too big for the kids to handle, C so he was just tied up to a post C so we gave him to, F uh, I don't know if you've, there is a place out here, F uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville C and they have, F uh, I guess it's <noise> kind of an animal shelter C but he just takes a few the animals in C and some he destroys C and some he keeps. C So we took him up there C and he ended up keeping him. F Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years. We, we've, saw him just about a year ago C and, F uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away C and so we asked him about it one day C and he said yeah, he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life just goes everywhere with him. I, he would have been a great, great dog.
