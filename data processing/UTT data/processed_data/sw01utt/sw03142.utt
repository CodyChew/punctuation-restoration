<Lipsmack> Okay, D well I guess I enjoy eating out, F um, F uh, here and there, C or it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home C and I guess I like a variety of, a variety of restaurants. F Uh, sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal, C and sometimes it's, I enjoy it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal. C And, F uh, sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad. Something, D you know, D Well, a variety. I, I like to go sometimes without them C and, sometimes I, sometimes it's okay to take them along. C So <laughter>, Sometimes I think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches C so, F uh, it just, D you know, it just varies, we do a mix. Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband C and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, D you know, have a moment of peace and quiet without <breathing> little ones at the table. C So, F uh, <lipsmack> I guess I guess D actually on those, those times, F uh, we even, there are times I even say, F oh, please don't sit us next to a table with other children, this is our night out. C So C but, F uh, D anyway, where do you like to eat? <Noise>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. F Oh, which one do you like? F Oh, okay. D Well, it's been a long time since we've been in there C but, F uh, C but it's good. There's an Italian restaurant over, over by the mall, over by, F uh, Plano Parkway there, pas <<very faintly>> F Oh, is it Campari's or something? D Well, it's good. I haven't, my husband had been in there several times C and we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day. C And, F uh, their pastas were great. <Noise>. <Sniffing> You're brave <laughter>. F Oh, God. Right. No, I don't think so <laughter>. <Lipsmack> F Oh, D well. <laughter> Even though traditional it can backfire. F Uh, D well my husband's kind of the eth, he, he's the ethnic fan. C So he's, I don't know. You know what, we read, we read the, F uh, D MAGAZINE we, we check that and, F uh, the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there. They often do ratings of restaurants, C so F uh, we've, F uh, we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on, from there, F uh, just for something that had a high rating. <Noise>. Okay. That's, That's right. <Noise>. <Noise>. F Oh good. F Oh, good. <Lipsmack>. F Oh. F Oh, yeah. We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too. That's true. That's true. F Oh right. Right. D Well I think that it's just, that's ex, <laughter>, sometimes I think going out to eat it's, it's sort of a recreation. D So, F uh, just a, just a change of pace from, F uh, eating at home. C So, F uh D anyway. I guess, F uh, as far as, as far as service when we go out F gosh, it's nice, it's nice to have someone <throat_clearing> come and wait the table. And clear the table and, Yeah, and do the dishes. C And, F uh, D actually it's kind of nice to, D you know, I always, F uh, a waitress or waiter that waits the table, <throat_clearing> it's nice that they're attentive C but it's not nice when they're too attentive. D So, F uh, we've had experience with that, too. C So, F Oh, yeah. <laughter> D Well, <throat_clearing> how we <laughter> it may, it may help their tip, may not, F huh. <Sigh> F Gosh, I guess just in Plano, I, Plano I like to go to Souper Salads. F Uh, Chili's, Chili's is always fine. I guess if we go to Dallas, into Dallas, we like, F uh, the Routh, is it Routh Street Cafe. <Noise> D Well D well, you would like it. You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome. It just, we've, we've taken people there several times C and, F uh, they have a good, they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding. I guess, it's, whether you call it Southwestern C but, F uh, F oh we had venison venison chili one time. Which was absolutely wonderful. C And then I guess it must be seasonal C and we've been back, F oh, I guess it's in the winter season D well they've never had it when we've been back, C so. C But, F uh, D well you ought to try that. It's, it's, it's very good. <Lipsmack>. No. <Noise>. F Oh, that's good. Yes, I've been there. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Do you usually go out, F uh, with the children or without them? <Laughter>. Right <laughter>. Yes. Yes. Yes. D Well, <Laughter>. F Uh, D well, F uh, we don't have any children C so, F uh, we tend to, like to try all sorts of different things. C And, F uh, we're very attracted to exotic food. C And, F uh, we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, F uh, sort of gourmet Mexican and, F uh, things like that, as well as TexMex and Italian and, F uh, Chinese and things, and, and things of that sort. D Now, yes, of course, we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers <laughter> or something like that, too. C And, F uh, we probably go out one to two times a week. C And, F uh, F uh, we're pretty much regulars at an Italian, local Italian restaurant. Momo's. Uhhuh. I've heard about it, I haven't been in there. Uhhuh. Tha, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me. I, I like different kinds of food. C So, when we go out, I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if, it's a Mexican Restaurant, like something other than, F uh, D you know the standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and fajitas D now. Yes, yes C and once in a while things backfire. E I mean, we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food, and things like that C And I'm not fond of some of those things C but we'll try, we'll try anything. Ethiopian, we've had Ethiopian. C And, F uh, not in Plano of course <laughter>. C But, we really, we really do enjoy going out C and F uh, C and, F um, I'm pretty adventurous in cooking, too, which also occasionally <laughter> backfires. Yeah. I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or, or what attracts us to a restaurant. How do you usually find a, a new restaurant? Uhhuh. So do we. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. We have found, F uh, a number of restaurants either through D and the, Friday paper and sometimes the, the OBSERVER. Which my husband usually picks up. And also through coupons. When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons. C And D you know, when they say, D you know, buy one get one free. It's hard to resist, C so we'll go in. C And very often we'll, find a place that we like C and we'll stick with it once they, give, they no longer give coupons. We'll, we'll, F uh, we'll stay there. C But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons, and the other half through the, through the newspaper reviews. E I mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that. It's very expensive to go out to eat. D So, yeah that, that is really one of our, it's almost a hobby with us. <Laughter>. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, absolutely. And do the dishes <laughter>. F Oh, yes. M, m, m, my sister, who also lives here in Dallas, F uh, tends to, F uh, chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner, which drives me absolutely batty. C but, What's your favorite restaurant? Uhhuh. Sure. D You know, we've never been there. C And that's supposed to be wonderful. F Um. Uhhuh. Ooh. Uhhuh. I would probably like that. One or two times in my life I've ever had venison, I've loved it. C But, D you know, just, it's just not, I don't know people who hunt C so <laughter>, F uh That's, that's supposed to be a wonderful place. W, F uh, F uh, F uh, here in Plano, D well, we tend to go to Momo's a, l, fairly often. C And, F uh, sometimes we'll go, D you know, we, we also go to Chili's and, F uh, Colter's Bar B Q, C and, C and F uh, we go to, lil, there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that, we go to. My husband particularly likes that. We go into Dallas, a lot and, because we're both were from the Richardson, North Dallas area, up until fairly recently. C And, F uh, we'll go down to, F uh, Blue Mesa Grill, Mexican food, C and
