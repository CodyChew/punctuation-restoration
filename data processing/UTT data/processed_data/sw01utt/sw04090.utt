Okay, Eric. F Uh, are you married C and do you have a family? Okay C and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. I see. F Uh <throat_clearing>, D Well, that's basically what we do. F Uh, about every, every three months or so, <inhaling> we reevaluate our budget C and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest C and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. I work part time at night C and he works, C and my husband works full times days C and so we have four checks, C but that works out nice because we get paid every week C and so that does help, that helps a lot. C And then, F uh, we don't have a lot ex, extra for extra spending, <Laughter> C so it's pretty well <laughter> ear marked. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Every penny is ear marked C but, F uh it, we have found that works the best C and <talking> C and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up. In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, D you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half, but <talking> and divide those up between all, uhhuh. C And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one C and then the next pay check we're real short C or, <Throat_clearing>. That's true. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes C and C and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget, C but you're <talking> wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in C and then you're saying, my word where did all that money go. Where does it go? F Uh C and also we have found that if we write down, C and we did this. We are not real consistent with this, C but we did it for about a month C and we wrote down everything that we bought <noise> when, D you know, every pay check C and so we could see where every penny went C and it was really interesting to see <throat_clearing> just what you do spend C and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. It's, we should cause it does help. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. D Wel, just stick to that, uhhuh. That is, <Laughter>. Yeah. That that sounds like a really good idea. C And it really helpful. F Uh, have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh that's good. That's a good feeling <throat_clearing>. <Smack> <inhaling> My husband just graduated from the university, F uh, <smack> a year ago C so finally <laughter> finally we are getting to that point too. D So, are you still going to school C or, F Uh, yes I am to, F uh, both questions. F Uh, yeah we do. We, F uh, F uh, basically there's the, D you know, the expenses that are fixed during the month D you know the ones that come every, every month C and we, F uh, enter those into, F uh, into a spread sheet <smack> C and, F uh, whatever is left, F uh, after that we, D you know, we sit down and agree on kind of what, what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for. <Smack> D So what do you do? Uhhuh. Wow <laughter>. Yeah. <Inhaling>. <Laughter>. Yeah. All allocated out. <laughter>. Yeah. All the checks, yeah. Right. Yeah, we found that, F uh, it's definitely helped, F uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. <Laughter> We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, F uh, <talking> <smack> spending, F uh, money for things that, D you know, we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have, <Talking> C and it was easy to, F uh, let things get out of hand. We thought it <talking>, F uh, thought it to be really helpful. We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that C so, Yeah <laughter> That's a lot of money, C but <laughter>, Yeah. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah, the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, D you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to, F uh, F uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, F uh, F uh, so long as it wasn't D you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in F uh <talking>, in an envelope or whatever C and that way it kind of forced us to, F uh, <noise> stick to that amount. And then once that was gone, D well <laughter>, if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say, F oh, it's gone <laughter>. D So. We, we haven't. We our our initial goal was just to retire debt, F uh, completely retire debt for car payments and credit card <talking> F uh, credit card debt and all of that. We are just at a point where, where we could start thinking about it C so <inhaling>, Yeah. D Well I <<very faint>>, Uhhuh. <Laughter> A student. Yeah, I am actually in the, <talking> in the mas,
