<Static> Your turn. D Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget. Both my wife and I, F uh, grew up in, F uh, families of rather modest means C and, F uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say. C And, F uh, we're both so, F uh, frugal that, F uh, we really don't need a budget, D you know. We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing. D Well we stay within our means C but we don't do it, F uh, by conscious effort. It just sort of happens automatically. D Although we just moved to California C and, F uh, the cost of living here in California is, F uh, I would say rather pathological <laughter>. F Uh, housing prices are, D you know, D like from four to ten times more expensive than, F uh, F uh, <<pause>> <lipsmack> they were where I came from in, F uh, Dallas. Yeah. C So, F uh F uh, that presents a, a real shock <laughter>. Ac, ac, actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California C but, Yeah. It's God's country. F Uh, C and one way you know that is that only God can afford it <laughter>. F Uh, C so budget is not a problem for us. F Uh, at least it hasn't been. It may, may be at this point. C But, F uh, up until this point it really hasn't been <inhaling>. When I, F uh, was in, F uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, F uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary <<mispronounced>> salary for engineers that, D you know, in my discipline, was like <lipsmack> F oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that. C And, F uh, I noted at that point that I was, D you know, if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever. C So I stopped worrying about money. C And it, never have worried about money since then. Sometimes, F uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, D you know, because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should. C But, F uh, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, of, F uh, investments C but, Uhhuh. D Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then. How big is your family? I see. <<Pause>> D So how, you, whe, once you get ten children though, you may have, F Oh, all right <laughter>. I have two kids. F Uh, one nine and one thirteen C and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, F uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point. I give them a, I give them an allowance C and they, F uh, I basically give my son ten dollars a week C and I put half of it in the bank C and I give, give him the other half in cold cash. C And, F uh, he has a teller card so he can, F uh, do what he wi, do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank. C But, at least, it isn't, D you know, burning a hole in his pocket. If he wants to use it, he has to go get it C and that usually <static>, F Oh, I, I start. Okay. D Well, F uh, we keep a budget to an extent. F Uh, C and really, i, i, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, F uh, F uh, restrictions C and you need to make sure all your bills are paid. F Uh, about yourself? Yeah. D Well I guess that really is sort of, F uh, keeping a budget, D you know. You stay within your, F uh within your means. Yeah. Yes <laughter>. F Oh, you moved from Dallas to San Francisco. That is a hugh difference. Yeah. C But you have good sour dough C and it's a beautiful place to live <laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that, that's a system too. D Well then again, D you know, you said you, you are able to take trips. C And you do, obviously, have enough to live on C so I guess you're indirectly budgeting. F Uh, just A byebye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, F uh, in spending the money. C So, E I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would think <<pause>>. It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money. Yeah. F Uh, D well we're, we have one on the way. F Uh, my wife, C and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, F uh, in, F uh, September. <Laughter> No I think it's just going to be one. <Laughter> How about yourself? F Oh. Do they budget at all? E I mean do you have them on an allowance? Yeah. Yeah.
