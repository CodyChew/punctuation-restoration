Okay. H, No, F um, we don't although we enjoy it. F Um, we do it more when we have company come. F Um, what about you? I've heard of that C but I haven't been there. F Um, where, about is that? F Oh, okay. I, I've been to Cafe Pacific. Right. Yes. F Uh <breathing>, Before we moved to, the area, my brother, F uh, lived in Dallas for a number of years C and we came up one time when my father was visiting C and we all ate there C and, F oh, their seafood was wonderful. D Now where is the Atlantic Cafe? F Oh, okay. No, F um, C but I've heard that's really good, too, C and, Oh. Oh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. <Laughter> You know right away what you want <laughter>. D Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too, C and, F uh, actually the, the Steak And Ale out here, F uh, we've gone to, F uh, my inlaws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday night C and, F uh, the time we went the prime rib was really good. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah <<very faintly>>. <Breathing> <laughter>. F Oh, I've heard about that, too C but no. <laughter> We've, F uh, I guess we eat out even less than I realize <laughter>. Oh <<very faintly>>. Yeah. Yes, I'd, I had heard that, too. F Um, Have you been to the little, F uh, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, F um, right here on Central Expressway? F Oh, okay. Yes, F uh primarily lunch, D well, and breakfast sometimes C but, F uh, during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, F uh, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninetynine that included the soup an, or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert C and, F uh, the, my husband and I like veal, F uh a lot C and their veal dishes have been good. We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the Uhhuh. F Huh, I, yes, no, Right. C And, I haven't either, F uh, one place, C and I've only been there for lunch, C but, F uh, I went with a friend, C and we met her husband, F um, down on Greenville, down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's, F Oh, I, we just we, It was C and we had the, F uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup C and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup C and they did. It was wonderful C but, F uh, C and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert <laughter>, which was a chocolate sack. I don't know if you tried C but C or s, Yes! It, D yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream C and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries in a raspberry, F uh, puree C and, C and <breathing> we shared one, the three of us C and it was plenty because it was very rich C but, F uh I wished I'd had a camera. It was beautiful <laughter>. F Uh <<very faintly>>. Oh. Oh. Yes. Yeah <<very faintly>>. Oh. It sounds wonderful. D Well, that's, F uh, one of the things th, that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant. F Uh, I love fresh berries. C And, their, their fruits are always exceptional. I don't, I'm, know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, F uh, you can't find them like that C and, Uhhuh. <Breathing> <laughter> I would, too, C because, D well, C because we don't go out very often. When we do go out, F um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess, C and, F uh, it is, it's a whole experience. Of course you want the food to be good C but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, F uh too. Yeah. <Breathing> <laughter> F Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track C but it is wonderful. It's called Cafe Max C and it's at Plano Road and Campbell. They have the most wonderful salads. They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three. Hi, Nancy. D Well, do you do a lot of dining out? Uhhuh. D Well, we do s, some dining out. F Um, I, I do a lot of cooking C so, F um, mostly D like when we go out, D you know, it's my husband and I, I, we don't go out too often as a family, <noise> F um, unless it's <static> D like a fastfood kind of thing. C But, F um, C but we do enjoy dining out. One of our favorite places here in, in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe. I don't know if you, have you ever been there? <Throat_clearing>. F Um, <talking> D well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and, F uh, Have you? Th, now that's down in, F uh, Highland Park. It's Highland Park Village. Did you like it? F Oh, I love it <laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. F Oh, it is, it's fabulous. It really is a great place. Atlantic Cafe is down on, I believe it's on McKinney. F Um, C and o, originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th, the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe. C And then they, they separated C and the guy started Cafe Pacific. C And, I loved them both. I really do. I think they're wonderful. That's our favorite. D You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's. Have you been there? It's wonderful. The only thing is <static> you have to wait. You have, you have to expect to wait at least an hour. C So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in. C And, a, as long as you know that <static>, it's okay. C But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib F um, anywhere <laughter> in the area. I love it. C And, my husband really likes their ribs. C So it's hysterical. We go in C and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in C and then we get there C and we don't even look at the menu <laughter>. I know right away what we, what we want. Yeah. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Was it? Really? I've nev, I've, I've been there for like, D you know, lunch C but, I've never been there for dinner. C And, it was good, yeah. F Oh, that's great. That's, great. Another nice place for, for prime rib is Baby Doe's Maxwell's nice, have you been there? <Laughter> C And I didn't think we ate out very often <laughter>. See! Baby Doe's is nice. C And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, F uh, is Lawry's. I've heard that's real good, Lawry's Prime Rib? I've, I've never been there C but I've heard it's real good. <Breathing> <laughter> Yes. Yes, D actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to. F Uh, they have real nice lunches. Have you, have you been there for lunch? C Or, Yeah. Really? Really? Uhhuh. The specials. Have you ever been to Biffin's? I keep hearing about it. I keep hearing the advertisements of it C and, C and they keep saying, D you know, F oh, it's wonderful, it's wonderful. I have not been over there C and I was thinking, D you know, it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl. C And, F uh, I've, I've not been there. <Sigh> I've been there. That was nice <breathing> <laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. <Laughter>. F Oh I've heard of it. Where, where it's made, it's like, it's like a, it's all chocolate, D like made like a paper bag C and it's filled with what, whip cream and, and strawberries and something? Yeah. Oh. <Breathing> <laughter> Oh. Oh. F Oh, I bet it was. I bet it was. The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day, C and we took another friend with us C and, F uh, <throat_clearing> for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves <laughter>. C And so we had, they had, F uh, D like a berry assortment. It was, it was raspberries and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with D like a custard on the bottom. C And, D you know, they did, D like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the, you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it <noise> C and it was outstanding. It was really, really relatively simple C but, F oh, it was good. It was really good. You can't find them. Yeah. <Talking> Yeah, yeah, yeah. <breathing> <laughter> D You know, i, I'm originally from Connecticut C and, F uh, I was home a few years ago C and my sister and brotherinlaw were going to take us out for dinner C and, F uh, I was really amazed, D you know, the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint. D You know, they were real, real pretty C but they lacked, <clicking> the service C and they lacked the at, the, just the, I don't know. The restaurants down here seem like they have, F uh, I guess there's so much competition that they, <clicking> really have to be good. C And, I thought <clicking> I would really miss that. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> C And, D you know, in order to survive in this area <clicking>, I think they have to be good. Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it. F Oh, really?
