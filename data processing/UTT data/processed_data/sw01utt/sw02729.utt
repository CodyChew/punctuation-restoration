D Well, F uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd. F Uh, she was, F uh, F uh, a person lives across the street from me, F uh, brought her home from work because a coworker of hers, F uh, had this dog appear on its front doorstep, somebody, somebody abandoned her C and, she's only about, F oh, si, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old C and, F uh, F uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though. She's, o, E I mean she's that, this young C and she's almost housebroken. E I mean she actually asks to go out. C And, F uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, F uh, would have been wrong with this dog, C so. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. I had a, F uh, last year I had ano, I had another German Shepherd, D now this one was purebred C and, F uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door C but, F uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time, C and, F uh, C and on huge doses of antibiotics, C and he actually got over it with, y, <laughter> seven hundred dollars in vet bills, F um, C but he had actually was able to get him over that. C And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, C and, F uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing C and then he got hit by a Cadillac. C So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard. C And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time C and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street, C so they just felt absolutely awful. C And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me C because, F oh gosh they, the, F uh, this fellow's wife who was, F uh, watching the dog, pro, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did C and, F uh. She was jus, really attached to it, C but, F uh, it's unfortunate, C but now, I've got another one, C so. F Uh, D see, he, it, it was just over a year. F Uh, it was in March of last year. C So, F uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year. Yeah. Right. My dad's like that, he, F uh, he had a beagle that he loved C and, F uh, when that beagle passed away, F uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way, no how, C and then, F uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October C and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, F uh, I E or, I gue, Humane Society and got, F uh, got another one, a stray. C And she, she turned out to be a great dog C and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently C and again dad went through the whole thing, C but, mom went an, Yeah. Yeah, it is. D Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them, they're always, always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy. Yeah. Right. This, this friend of mine has, th, D well it's the same guy that was watching, F uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, C but, F uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever C and then I had, F uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy C and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. C And this, they just, they had a ball romping around, C and, D you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in. C And, F uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, F uh, river current, C and, F uh. D Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in C and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before. C But he jumped in, in the, the river. D Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water, C 'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her. C And up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now. C And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, C but, F uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, F uh, actually paddled up against the current and, F uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up C and then, he, he jumped in again, C and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it. Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, F uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad, C and so, C but, F uh, she got over it, C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, F um, it's on Oneida lake C and I'm wondering if, F uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. E I mean, I've got, the yards all fenced in C so she doesn't run loose, C but, F uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her, C so. F Oh really. Yeah. No, no. F Oh really. F Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. C And that was the thing I couldn't figure out C because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't i, normally, E I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, C but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it. Yeah. Right, right, obstinate, obstinate. Uhhuh. I'll have to check it out. I saw the, the, F uh, previews for it and all C and it did look like it'd be a good mo, movie, C but, F uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately. C But, I got to do more, more fun things. Yeah, yeah. D Well I'm, F uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force C and so I travel a lot. C And yeah, I'm a engineer at, F uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, C so. That's how I got into, F uh, into the switchboard project and all that, C so. C But it's nice having a dog here, F uh, the, Un, un, F uh, what's the, unrequir, what's the word I'm looking for, F uh, lots of affection, no co, unconditional affection from the, from the dog. Yeah, yeah. No, no. Yeah, D well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, C so <laughter>. Okay, what kind of puppy you got? F Uh. Uhhuh. Oh. Wow. That's great. <Laughter>. Yeah, D well I, I have a dog that God gave us too, <laughter>. Yeah, she just appeared. Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, C but we've had her now for about three years, C and I just, you get so attached to them. Uhhuh. F Um. Wow. Uhhuh. F Oh no. F Oh, gee. Uhhuh. F Oh, I bet. F Oh gosh. Yeah, yeah. How long has it been since the first one? F Uh, yeah, Yeah. D Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one C and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me. E I mean I was just, <laughter>, D you know, I couldn't even talk about it for months C and so I decided D well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore <laughter>. C And then God gave me this dog, C so <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Okay, yeah. D Well you just do, you can't help i, it's like, it's like a kid. Yeah, D well when, F uh, my, my doggie, F uh, that we have now, F uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever. The vet called her, F uh, a golden mix <laughter>, D like who knows, D you know. C But she's, F uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, D you know. C And, F uh, C and her nose is that pink, D you know, she doesn't have a brown nose, C and her ey, she's sort of unicolor, D you know, eyes are the same color and everything, C so. I named her Rosebud, C and, F uh, a friend of mine said, th, she, that she gre, this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, F uh, a pet cow named Rosebud C and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years <laughter>. Yeah, right. C And she's so easy going and so sociable, D You know, she loves everybody. C And little kids can just, D you know, maul all over her, C and she just, D you know, thinks it's great. Uhhuh. Getting in, yeah. F Oh, no. Really. Did puppy go to? F Oh, that's good, yeah. <Laughter>. Ugh, ugh. <Laughter>. Yeah, <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool, C and, F uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming C but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. D You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot. C And she'd just lay there on that step and just, D you know, cool off <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. D Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that. Yeah, C and she, F oh baths. F Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. It was, it was just really a fight to, D you know, get her clean. Have you seen, F uh, CANINE. The movie, F oh, you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German, it is so cute. Yeah, C and, F uh, C an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up C and it's, it's just hysterical. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well that's how Cleo, w, D you know, she'd lay on her step, C but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet C and she didn't want you getting her wet <laughter>. Yeah, C but you really need to see that movie. I, I w, we bought the movie C and I don, I don't know how many times I've seen it. C And it came on T V the other night C and I was watching it again, C and my husband heard me laughing C and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie <laughter>. It is great. Yeah. D Well we always wait until we can rent them, D you know <laughter>. F Oh really. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, there's just, Right, that's it. Really, not critical at all. <Laughter> Yeah, they're really wonderful. <Laughter>.
