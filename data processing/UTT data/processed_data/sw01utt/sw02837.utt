Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay. F Oh, my. You, You are experienced I would say. D Well, I agree. I have done something, F uh, like that, too, only not nearly as extensive. C But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch, style home. F Uh, after having a one that was historical looking. Yes. Uhhuh. D Well, maybe you can, F uh, make that one charming and, and make a little bit money, F uh, Yes. D Well, we just moved to Charlotte, from Enid, Oklahoma. C So I know, of what you're talking about, as far as the market was concerned C and I'll tell you, F uh, we, we had kind of a charming house. It was a cedar shake house, and very weathered. C And, F uh, it was about fifty years old, but not tra, not really, F uh, traditional looking, particularly. C And, F uh, C so I tried to make it, after I sold my business I, in, in, I spent almost three years redoing. C And I considered it a full time job C and when we did, F uh, we kind of had planned this, F uh, trek to the east, because we're both originally from this part of the country. C And so, I think some of the things that I did paid off. For instance, one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you F uh, was something I did on the outside. I love old estate, estate sales. I happened to go to just a little estate sale that, just a little white frame house, where the couple, F uh, was very old, and had gone into nursing homes C and F uh, all the men started going down to the barn. C And so I, th, D well shoot I'm going, Yes, I'm going to the barn, too. They, F uh, auctioned some tools and, things like that, C but then they went over and started, F uh, auctioning this big stack of bricks. C And, so, D well, I thought, gee, I've been wanting to, do some brick, F uh, walkways for a time. D Anyway, it ended up after some pretty, F uh, heavy bidding, that I got all those bricks for forty dollars. C And, so my husband and I loaded bricks in his, pickup truck for days. C But, what we ended up with was about four thousand. For forty dollars. C And so what we did, we had built a deck on the back of that house, C but it needed C and, it was quite large out to, into the yard C but, on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together. C So we, made brick patios, and walkways. C And so for, C and he, he did the digging, which was about six inches, C but I figured the sand and all, had that delivered and, leveled it and, and, placed most all the bricks. C And it turned out beautifully. Yes. D Well, it nearly killed me <laughter>. I hated to leave it. Uhhuh. No we, D Well, I, D Well, no, I, I didn't have that trouble because, F uh, we laid the, I did get some material <throat_clearing> and studied every bit of material that I could study, C but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them, C because when you start C and we put them on a base of four inches of s, sand C and then we, F uh, we swept sand in between, C but C but it was an error to, to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever. You just put them together as close as you can. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, C and I also used a rubber hammer, a lot, to, F uh, D you know, if it wasn't quite level or something, I'd just get that, rubber hammer and, F uh, and, and prob, D you know, I think that they could, if they have problems with, F uh, sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a, F oh, a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway. <Laughter>. D Well, I think, I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are C and, yeah, is it diazinon C or what is it that will, F uh, Dursban or something like that. Dursban, I think in this area or most all areas they use, D you know, for ticks and fleas. C And D you know, they're, awful hard to do anything with. Yeah. I bet Dursban would do it. Yeah. I think, F uh, you probably just need to make sure that it dries, very, very careful, F uh, well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that. D Well, gosh, Deb, we could talk all day couldn't we <laughter>. Yes. Wow. Oh. F Oh, good. Uhhuh. Yes. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Sure, F uh, I'll offer anything that I can on the subject. F Uh, my husband and I just bought a, just moved here recently C and, F uh, we bought, F uh, this house about, F uh, I don't know, year and a half ago. What we have here now is just a basic three bedroom, two bath, brick house which is, F uh, completely different from what I had had before. When I was working and before I married, F uh, I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and, F uh, historic old houses and things like that C so I, F uh, tried to, I was in the process of renovating a house and, F uh, that was about seventyfive years old. C So, F uh, it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled, jacked up, F uh, new plumbing, new wiring, wallpaper, paint, everything you can think of, that house had to have <laughter>. D Well, I, I really did enjoy it, F uh, D you know, it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it. Yeah. Uhhuh. It is. It is. Yeah. That's, that's true. When, F uh, I met my husband, he was living in an apartment at the time C and, C and, F uh, the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here. C So, F uh, D you know, I, we, really it was just the market was so good, we hadn't really planned on buying C and, as you probably heard from the, in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal. E I mean you can get things for such a song. C So, that's, that's really why we ended up in a house like this. This is not what we, D you know, what we want to stay in forever, because I have to have my, I've found that after doing this other house, I have to have my hands into stuff C and, D you know, I'm always just wanting to paint and, and wallpaper and redo and redo, C so, F uh, D you know, I, I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into <laughter> C so, Yeah. That's, that's the key, D you know, the thing is, F uh, when we moved in they had just, F uh, painted, wallpa, we're, D you know, wallpapered, new carpet and everything C so I feel sort of, F uh, D you know, like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now <laughter> and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it. C So, F uh, we'll see, we'll see how much longer we're here. Uhhuh. F Oh, Oklahoma of all places. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, it is, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I see, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uh, oh <laughter>. That's where I need to go <laughter>. Exactly. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Oh. Uhhuh. Work, right, right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. <Laughter> F Oh, no. F Oh, my word. <Breathing> For forty dollars? F Oh, my. Uhhuh. Something. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, how fun. F Oh, how nice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, I bet. C And what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way <laughter>. Yeah, C but, C but you did stag, stagger back and say, F oh, doesn't this look nice. D Well, let me ask you, when you laid those bricks, I know my parents bought a house about ten years ago, they're fixing to sell it again, but, and move again. They're kind of, my mom's like I am. She's a renovator, a lover of old things C and, D you know, they have to be doing something constantly. C And the patio that came with that house, F uh, was not laid on a, D like, I don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un, on, on top of the sand and then lay the bricks. C But they have, they have a problem with these little tin, D like sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks. C And, of course D you know you have the, F uh, the weeds that come up in between the bricks or, and things like that. Uhhuh. Yeah. I see. Okay, yeah. Uhhuh. As tight as you can. That's probably, because they had, D you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a par, a barbecue and tell everybody, guess what, we're going to, we're going to redo the patio, D you know, we're going to pull up all the bricks, C but, F uh, they just, they just haven't brought themselves to do it. D So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Right, D well the thing that's funny is they've done, F uh, they've done things like that, D you know, I'll catch her out there spraying around, C and then it's like, in two days time they'll come home from work C and those little things are back. It's just, they're the most resilient little characters C and so, I don't know what they're finally going to do. She may just, hopefully they'll sell the house, and go somewhere else <laughter>. C And then she won't have to worry about it. <Laughter> What are these things? Right. Yeah, what it, what it is that'll, that'll, take care of them. Yeah. Right. F Oh, that's true. That's true. C But my, my dad farms C and, D you know, she's always telling him, isn't there something that, that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray, D you know, out in the, out in the field, that you can get rid of, these bugs, C but, F uh, It might, it might do it, yeah. She's got so many flow, she's got just a gorgeous yard, so many, F uh, flowers and her, her four cats, D you know, C so she's sort of, F uh, real funny about what she sprays. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I know, I, I was just, D you know, it just seems like I, as I said when I heard the, what the subject was, I thought F oh, gosh I haven't thought about, F uh, what I went through at that other house in so long. I've been so busy. C But, F uh, I don't know of everything that I did, I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most C and I thought that would be the hardest thing to do. C But, F uh, gosh, D you know, I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house, F uh, up the stairway, even. D You know, I just had a ball with it, it was so much fun. Yeah. C And I've sworn up and down, my mom's, F uh, my mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris, Texas, C and the one thing that she ended up with is, was the old door, that was, that was on the front door of that house C and she has that up in her attic C and I have sworn that it, I'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does <laughter>. C So, as far as looking toward the future, D you know, that's my plan. I'm going to have to move fast, I think, though, because, F uh, D you know, as a,
