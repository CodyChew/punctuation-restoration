D Well, F uh, what is your favorite kind of music? F Oh, same here. Yeah. F Oh, D well, I guess I like a wide range. F Uh, everything from, F uh, from Baroque through at least some modern music. C And my wife and I these days are especially into opera. We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now. D Well, we, F uh, generally, the places we've gone they sing in the original languages. Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess. D Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, F uh, you, D you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse, F uh, video tape C and so we have quite a collection of those, C and you watch them at home, C and they have subtitles, C so you, you figure out what's going on after a while, C and then you can enjoy it in the, F uh, theater. C But, D you know, the, F uh, Dallas opera now has, F uh, super titles on, on all their performances I think. D Well, they, they give an, F uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage. Yeah. <Throat_clearing> In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, D well, I really like Vivaldi. F Uh, he's, F uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Oh <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. How, how old are they? C So they're doing this in school, or what? Uhhuh. D Well, you've got half a string quartet there. Yeah. D Well, since you seem to like, F uh, Italian music, have you ever, F uh, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, F uh, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess? Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, yes, uhhuh. No, I don't, C but I think I know what it is. Isn't that a, F uh, F uh, D see, can't you get records through that or something, recordings? Uhhuh. Yes, yeah, I think, F uh. F Uh. F Uh, yes, right <laughter>. C So, they're actually commissioned performances. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, I had go, heard good things about the, F uh, Music Heritage Society, C but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on on music. I almost, F uh, almost, F uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago. Yeah, my roommate signed me up. He got a bonus record, C and I got a lot of bills <laughter>. C So we have to watch that. F Uh, do you play any instrument yourself? D Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, F uh, classical music. F Oh, really. What type of music do you like in the classical area, C or what era <<mispronounced>> do you, era do you like the most? Uhhuh. F Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, F uh, if I don't know the story line and, F um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on. Uhhuh. Oh. What is that? F Oh, I didn't know that. That can help people like me. <Laughter> D Well, I can understand that. C So, I'd say, Vivaldi is probably my favorite, F uh, composer. Yeah. I like Baroque music, I like full body music, F uh, with the, F um, F um, with brass and winds, woodwinds, instruments, D you know. Course I like, F uh, also string instruments, C and I have two string instruments in my house. F Uh, instrument players, both my sons play string instruments. One plays the cello C and the other one plays the viola. C So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year <laughter>. One is thirteen and one is eleven. Yes. Yes. Yeah. We're on our way. C So, F uh, F um, I try to enjoy all of it. F Um, a little bit, C but, F um, a lot of the, F um, music I don't know about, F uh, as far as the titles, C and I have to listen to it, and and figure out, what I'm listening to. F Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society. Do you belong to that? You can get recordings. F Uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, F uh, or cassettes or L P s, C and, F uh, they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves. C But they also, F uh, they also, F uh, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess, what do you call them <inhaling> the guys that orchestrate the con, the conductors. Yeah. They go to conductors, F uh, C and, C and they actually have them perform the music, C and they record it. Sure. A lot of them are. C Or they will kno, find out when they're performing, C and they will, F uh, record the music at that time. C And so, F uh, it is, F uh, F uh, high quality grade music, C and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section, C and they also have a, F uh, more contemporary and American F uh, composer section. <Laughter> Yeah. D Well, you can control it. F Oh, really. I see. D Well, that's good. Yes, I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone.
