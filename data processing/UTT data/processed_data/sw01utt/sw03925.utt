Okay. I think the first thing they said, I have written this down C so it would, is it p, do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government? Yeah. Right. That's a good point. That's an int, D you know, that's interesting. I had read something one time C and it was just applying to governments in general, it was written many years ago. It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers. C And I thought that was interesting. It wasn't just talking about our government. It was just government in general. From times past, D you know on C and, Right. C And that would be a next question to ask. How many do you think are in there for pub, for bu, C because they want to be a service to us C or are they in there for their own gains, C and personally I feel it's probably, there's probably some of each. Uhhuh. Yeah. <<Very faint>> Yeah. F Oh, yeah. C And they talked, F uh, the other, let's see. Third question was how m, serving for their own gains do you think goes on, then they, that's hard to answ, I'm sure there's a lot. D But I agree with you, there's a lot in business. I think that's just, I think that's very normal, that we should not ex, I think, I think we put too much on politicians. We expect them <laughter> to only be there to serve us, D you know. Yeah. That's a problem, isn't it? It's interesting C because I'm taking a Texas government class right now, C and one of the things it's so easy to blame them to a lot of times I think it's our own fault. They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth. C And it, If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and, Especially with all this fron, co, stuff coming up here lately about people's past, C and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore. Because it's, I think it's gotten just care, D well, we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life C and, C and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at <throat_clearing>. Right. D You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out. I don't think there would be too many left <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Uh, at, F uh, it's T C J C. Tex, Tarrant County Junior College. Yeah. C And it's really, it's really enjoyable. I like it. C And then they also, D you know, ask can we eliminate, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption, C and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally. Yeah, C but that, doesn't mean, I don't think making laws will stop it. E I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have. E I mean, No, sure didn't, did it? C So no, I think you can legislate C but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating, C and we would end up with so many more laws that, D you know, E I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, E I mean, D you know. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes C but when I think about where I'd want to go, D you know, this is still the best C or I can, Yeah. Yeah, C at it's worst I think we've got the best. Okay. You're asking what my opinion about, whether it's possible <laughter> to have honesty in government. D Well, I suspect that it is possible. F Uh, I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody. C But, F uh, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty. Uhhuh. C So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers. Right. Yeah. C But I think maybe a lot of them, F um, say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while, I'm in office. C And, D you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth. C So I guess it would be like anything else. The president of General Motors probably has the same, <Laughter>. I think I, I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be, more to the point. If you knew what you were getting when you voted, F uh, Yeah. Yeah, they say you, get the government you deserve. Uhhuh <throat_clearing>. It's hard to imagine. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, C and it almost seems like in order to avoid, F uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, on, say in the Bobsy twins or, something like that <laughter>. <Laughter> D So you're taking a government course? At what? The university? Oh. Okay. You can make laws against corruption <laughter>. C But that doesn't eliminate it, does it? D Well, they've got laws against cannib, cannibalism C but that didn't stop that guy in, Milwaukee, did it? <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> Actually, I think other countries may have it worse, F uh, the Japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal. Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him. D So, F uh, Yeah, I've been around to a few other countries C and I, F uh, I, I have not found one yet that I would rather live in. I think, F uh,
