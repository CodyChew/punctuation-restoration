Kay. I guess we're talking about exercise, F huh? F Oh, I am twentyseven. <Laughter>. You do? What type of exercise do you do? F Oh you do. Yes. Are they different from aerobics C or is it the same thing? C And you do that every day C or, F Oh, okay. C And this is a club C or, F uh, do you belong to a group? Do you go with friends C or do you go alone? Yeah. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh <<very faint>>. F Oh yeah <laughter> young mothers or, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Uh, I really don't have a routine. I like playing basketball. We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop C and that's what I do every day. Yeah, pretty much. When my wife let's me. No, I just shoot around by myself. C And, F uh, that's about it. I use to play soccer a lot in high school, C but when I graduated I haven't done much. I don't have a problem. I know I have to do more aerobics, C but I don't have a problem with weight. I could eat all day and not gain an ounce <laughter>. Uhhuh. You do exercise. You do it <noise>, Uhhuh. Yeah C and I D well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days, C but <noise> I don't know <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I guess I enjoy sports a lot C so that's why I've kept active in that way. F Uh, basketball, volleyball, F uh, too bad it's not <noise> really heavy as far as recreation or hobby, I do that. F Uh, I use to, C but it got too expensive, C so. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of people do that C and <noise> C but, <noise> D well I just <<sounds like>> I never find the time. I had rather do other things. F Oh they come up here. That's in Nevada. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah C but, There's Snow Bird or Alta. Heavenly? F Huh. I've never heard of that one. Huhuh. <Laughter>. Do they exercise much or, E I mean for skiing? I know when I went, you can get sore easily C but, F Oh yeah. is one or two timer a year if I do go on them C and I am really sore after. Yeah. My legs really, really ache. C But, that's, <noise> I am using <noise> muscles that I have never used before. Okay. Yeah, yeah. D Well first of all I, I ha, have to ask you how, how old you are? Twentyseven, okay. D Well, I am quite a bit older than you are <laughter>. C But, no. I think exercise is extremely important C and I I do exercise on a regular basis. D Well, I do, F uh, jazzercise which is an aerobic, F uh, <smack> program that, are you familiar with it? It's, F uh, D you know, a national company C and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes D like all day long C so you can, No it's really, it's an aerobic routine. Yo, you warm up C and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, D you know, slowly and then working up to, F uh, D you know, a high heart rate C and then you gradually go down again. No, I only do it <throat_clearing> probably two or three times a week. The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. <Smack> D Well, it's really a <smack> E I mean <noise> it's called a center C and you buy as many classes as you want to <noise> at a time C and then you just go in whenever you can. C So, D like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. <Smack> No, I go by myself C and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me C and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise <laughter> C or they might play tennis C and since I am not a tennis player, F uh, D you know, I don't get that, C but I am, D you know, I am between, I am in my late forties C so, F uh, there aren't many people, D you know, that want to do that. Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. D You know, with with children between the ages, Young mothers. D You know, young women, with small children are the ones that I find. D Well, what do you do? F Oh, great. Yeah. Do you play every day? D Well, D now who do you play with? Do you have friends that play with you C or just, Yeah. D Well D see, that's, that's th, really good C and I think that keeps a lot, some people from exercising. E I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either, C but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise. D You know E I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin <noise> C and it's because I <noise> exercise C but I also watch what I eat. D You know, C but you'll come, being twentyseven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet C but as you get older you will. D Well, it might not <laughter>. Mine, C because everybody's been telling me that too C and so far it hasn't happened, D you know, C and I, I just feel like, D you know, <noise> you have to constantly <noise> weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it <talking> starts to get D you know, too high. Yeah. C But you don't play any other sports but basketball? C But, do you ski? Being in Utah, I was wondering if you ski. F Oh did it really? C Cause I know that skiing in Utah is, is suppose to be <static> great. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I have never skied before, C but I have friends that go to Utah all the time C and they think it's really C and they ski. I guess there's a place where you can ski, D well is it Tahoe? Where you ski from, no that's Nevada to California I guess. Yeah, I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. C But there's a fun, there is a place in Utah called a funny name. C But it's like, F Oh, Heavenly. Is that it? Yeah, I think it's called Heavenly. You've never heard of that? D Well, maybe it isn't in Utah. C But they said they've skied Heavenly C and <laughter> it sounded like, <laughter> D you know, that they skied really well, and when they are actually talking about a place. It's kind of funny. F Oh yeah. You can get really sore. I know you, E I mean I've talked to people, C but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore. C And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst? In your legs and, Yeah. Yeah. D Well, C and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, D you know, all the time C and then I went horseback riding C and still I was so sore C and I couldn't get over,
