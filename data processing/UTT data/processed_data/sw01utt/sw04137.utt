Let's see, mine's pretty easy actually. F Uh, I just got done reading a, a magazine E or a couple magazine articles about the, F uh, new Saturns. F Uh, C and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just like love to have one. D Well, No, regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the be, cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for, F uh, doing a little autocross racing, F uh, closed circuit racing C and, F uh, it seems to just blow the com, compe, competition away. Handling, power, everything. Yeah, it just got D like the top rating. It was compared up against, F uh, let's see, there was D like the Mazda M X three, F uh, Nissan's, whatever, their two, N X two thousand, the Civic S I C and it just, D you know, it, it dominated over all of them. Everybody, all the, F uh, raters loved it. I like the, I like the styling C and, I seen a few of them actually race C and they seem to be really good cars for it. Mustang G T s? F Uh, can't afford it. Right, yeah, I'm a graduate student C and, let's face it, I don't make any money C so, <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see then. Yeah, right now I'm stuck, I, I've got a, a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable C and trying to get it prepared for racing. C But it's, it would be nice, just D like scrap it and go for the g, Saturn. F Oh, yeah, I'd do it, I'd use it for both. The nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both. F Uh, just like a, F uh, set up a lot of times C and it's like really large, F uh, parking lots. And pylons and things. Tight turns, hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs, F uh, compete C and it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class. Yeah. F Uh, what are you thinking about buying? The Legend. F Uh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, D well, I was, I was actually in, F uh, a lot of the B M W s are produced in, F uh, sh, F uh, Stutgardt and, F uh, and Munich C and I was, I was there this, F uh, summer C and, F uh, i, I was really impressed by the, F uh, the, F uh, factory, F uh, tours and such for B M W. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. F Uh, <Laughter> F Oh, of course, of course they are. They want you to buy their car. Yeah, there, it was, it was interesting. I was at, I, I also went to, F uh, the Porsche C and, F uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed. Yeah, the, F uh, the B M W is really, F oh, like, F oh, we have all these D like high tech things C and everything is put together with exacting tolerances C and, C and then you go to Porsche C and it's like, D well, F uh, these cars are completely handmade C and no two of them are alike <laughter>. C And C so it's like completely opposed. I don't know, which do I like better, I think I like the <laughter> Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical. Unless, it's, it's a toy. Let's face it. Yeah, yeah, C but it, it, B M W s good for that. What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for? Wow, yeah. That's cool. Yeah, that's good. I also, I was impressed by, F uh, by the Mercedes, too. I really, I really like the Mercedes. The factory was nice C and, C And is it different for the, for the B M W? Probably. Right, <laughter> I can imagine that. Uhhuh. F Oh, really, you like, F uh, C so you're an American you want to buy American. F Um. It terms of handling, F uh, acceleration, What about Mustang G T s? Those, C so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, p, price range. Right. D Well, you can wait till you graduate C and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want. <Laughter>. Right, would you use that for city driving and racing? Autocrossing is, what kind of track is that? Okay. C And you put up, set up the track, pylons. Okay. F Oh, really? Yeah, I would guess so. F Uh, I think I'd like to get, F uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, F uh, or maybe a, Hon, E I mean, a, a Acura Legend. F Uh a Lexus, F uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order. I haven't really determined if I like the, the Japanese or the, if I like them enough to purchase one. <Laughter>. D You know, because your B M W s, your German cars have good reputations, I think. Yes. The, Yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, E I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take <laughter>. E I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, F uh, Munich, it's kind of <laughter>, they're trying to brainwash you, too <laughter>. F Oh, really? F Um. <Laughter>. Yeah that's, No, it's not realistic. Yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, F uh <laughter>, Yeah, just work, short trips. No m, no heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year. C So it's pretty minimal. Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for. F Oh, yeah. C But, C But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things <laughter>. F Uh, I think, D well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly <laughter>. C So I'm kind, yeah, I'm not sure if I really want,
