I drive a Honda Prelude. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. I bought mine a year ago C so I'm not buying a car any time soon. Yeah. Yeah. It, D Well, I, I like where all the controls are they're, they're in good spots C and I, I have an automatic I can't drive a standard. Yeah. C But, F um, I, it's, C an it's supposedly real reliable the only thing I've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first. Yeah. Yeah. I had a Buick Regal. Yeah. The Buick was, was great. It was nine years old C and it, was still going strong. The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it, I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old. C And that was the only major problem that I had, E I mean, I had D like little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler C and I had replaced the tires C and, F uh, seems like it had a radiator leak once. C But I never had any major anything, other than the compressor. Huhuh. D Well, I never, D well, I kind of know how to drive standard C but I've never owned one C so I hadn't, I don't drive one a lot. D So, I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it. C And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic. C And, C and resale value is really important to me <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. I did pretty well with my, F uh, Regal because it was in really good shape C but, it still looked real nice, the, the interior was still really nice, there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff. C And it had some, some nice features. C So I ended up okay with the Buick, C and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it, of course, I may never sell it <laughter>, I may drive it until it's dead C but, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car. I, F uh, I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something C so C and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore C and it was only like a year old C and I had never driven, F uh, a Prelude. C So, I went to a dealership because they had D like, F uh, the same year and same model, of Prelude on their used car lot C and I went and I test drove it C and, D you know, I just fell in love, with this brand new white Prelude, F uh, D you know, two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof C and I, bought it loaded. F Oh, Yeah. I went there looking at a used car C and two days later I bought this car. I felt like, I felt like that was the worst impulse, that was, that was largest impulse that I, that I had ever made. The oth, the two, other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer <laughter>, and dryer. I go for the big stuff. Oh. Yeah. I got, I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift. Yeah. C But I, I guess this wasn't really an impulse, E I mean, buying it right then and, D you know, right quickly was kind of impulsive C but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years C and I was just scared to. I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for. Buy a, wha, ar, you, buy a used car? Sure. Yeah. D Well, F um, like on Hondas they, supposedly, the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever C and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars C and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff. E I mean they can't stop you from doing it. Yeah. D Well, C and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea from a, if you can get a good mechanic to, check it over real carefully and check the block and everything. D So. Okay. D Well, I enjoyed talking to you. Byebye. What kind of a car do you drive now? Do you? I drive a Honda Accord. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, me either. I just bought mine, F uh, it will be a year in August. I love it though. I love Hondas. I think I found my car. Right. F Oh, really, I have a standard. F Oh, really? I hadn't heard that. What did you have before you bought that. Did you? I had, F uh, a Mazda R X Seven before that C and that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life. Really? Really? Yeah. Right. I really never had anything major with my Mazda C but it was a standard also C and the clutch went out on it toward the end, I had it five years C and the last year, last two years it seemed to go out really easily. I think it went out twice in two years C and that's, that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much. C And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda C but I don't think I'm going to do that again. I think I'm going back to automatic now. Right. Right. Yeah, it is. That's true. Yeah, it is me too that's why I got the Honda. Hondas have great resale value. The Mazda definitely did not <laughter>. Not at all. They're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes. Yeah. Right. Good. Right. Yeah. That's what I did with the Mazda, drive it until the, until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off, D so, probably what I'll do again. C But I really like the Hondas. I like foreign cars a lot. I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant. I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long, C and it was so small C and it's really impractical. C So, I wanted something with a real trunk, and four doors something easy to get in and out of C and I looked at the Galant C and those were really nice C and I can get them for a great price. C But I found it hard to deal with the, the dealership I was going through. D So, that's how I ended up with a Honda. Right. F Oh, yeah. They're nice I think. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. I have to have them loaded, F um, I love all those little things that you don't need C but they're so wonderful. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. I understand. <Laughter>. Yeah. I noticed <laughter>. Mine was definitely not impulse I really needed a new car. Mine was just, it was getting worn out I guess from being a sports car. I drove it kind of hard, C and I got it right after high school. C So, by the time I traded it in it was ready. Ready to go. Did you? Right. Right. That's the same with me. Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself? D Like, Right. I, I was going to buy one once C but I just, I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that. Just, I can't seem to get over that. That just bothers me <laughter> I don't know why. Yeah, that's true. Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. D Well, I guess that's all. I enjoyed talking to you. Byebye.
