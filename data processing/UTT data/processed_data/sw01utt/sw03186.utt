All right, this is easy for me since I, Yeah, D well I travel, I do about forty percent of my time is on the road. I eat a lot of meals out, D well I'm also married C and my wife is an A one cook, C but she enjoys eating out, C so I have to share it with her. C And, F uh, actually it's very easy for me, because I, I have a prac, make it a practice when I am out, I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here. C So, I look for just about anything, C and it's, it's, F uh, it's a lot of fun. I don't have to worry, really worry too much about price considerations because I, D you know, F Oh, sure, yeah, C and it's, it's really great. I, I, I like different types of food. F Uh, F oh you na, okay you name it. Let's see, you've got one down in, F uh, down near, F uh, Addison, F uh, there's two restaurants that I particularly like that I, every time I get into Texas or I get into Atlanta, Georgia, I make sure I go, C and that's Houston's. Yep, okay. It's, it's great. There's a, a restaurant in, F um, right outside of Reading, Pennsylvania, A it's called Alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people. C But it is fab, fantastic. F Uh, there's a restaurant, A and I don't recall the name of it, F uh, in, F uh, Panama City. Of course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama City, F uh, Panama, the country, F uh, Panama. No this is the country this is the country Panama, all right? C And, F uh, C but I have gotten to quite a few. C And I go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there. I, D you know, C and I know the locations, C and I know the places, C but I, lot of times I don't remember the names. I'd have to go back through some expense reports. C But particularly, down in your area, I'm looking for some, some more restaurants. C So, I, D you know, I don't know what's, what's down there, the ones out in Addison. Not particularly that's one of the few, why, which one were you going to recommend? Uhhuh. Right. Okay, I have a, Okay, let, I'm, I'm writing it down <laughter>. Okay. I've been there. Okay, I've been there. F Um, one down there is the, F uh, I think it's an old schoolhouse. D Well, I like the food, C but I don't care for the clowning around. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? F Oh I've had, That's it, that's it. I've had excellent food there. True. True. Uhhuh. Yeah, all right, D well, that's great. F Uh, no, Italian is fine. I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in Ad, F Oh, yeah. All right. Really? Uhhuh. Good. D Well, this is great. This is going to give me some more places to go. <Laughter> Okay, fine. I guess our time's about up, C so. F Uh, D well, they don't always. Yeah, I they've been doing that when, F uh, the circuits are busy C and other than that, they, D you know, leave you go about five minutes, C and then, that, that's about it. I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat, C so. It was a pleasure talking to you. Okay. You bet, Byebye. C And me too, because I eat out a lot. C So you eat all your meals out. Sure. I was going to ask you, could you go to, D you know, nice places, C and, <Sniffing>. D So where are your, what are the places, D you know, memorable places you've eaten? F Oh, Houston's, uhhuh. It's a great place. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay, C because I was thinking, D well, I, I grew up in Panama City. I get it. Right. Uhhuh. Do you like Mexican? Do you like Mexican food. Oh. D Well, E I mean, there's so many places here, D you know, there's just, it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here. C But in the Addison, D well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway. E I mean, now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi that has a great, A I've not been there, but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas, C and now there's one in Addison. It's F, S it's S F U Z I. C And it's on, it's in Addison, C and it's a great place. Also a great place that they have D like Cajun food is Copelands. D Now I really like Copelands. F Oh, the, D yeah, the, I know, no, I don't like that place. D See, F uh, F uh, yeah, I, I, when I went, I thought the food was not good. Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of, D See, I, when I went, I thought, the people drove me crazy first of all C but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was. Do you like, like Southwestern? D Well, now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact. C And, F um, it's great, E I mean, their, they have, I think, sometimes I've been when I thought, D Well, it wasn't as good, C but I went there recently, C and I thought, D Well, this really is good. C So that's, that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill. C And, F um, A whole new, dining experience. D Well, they haven't beeped us, have they? F Oh, I thought sometimes they say, D you know this is three minutes or whatever. F Oh, okay. Okay, D Well, thanks for calling for helping us out. Byebye.
