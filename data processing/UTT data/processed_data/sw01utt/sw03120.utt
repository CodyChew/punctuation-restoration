Okay <<faint>>. Yes, I did. I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia. F Uh, it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students. I had gone to a small school growing up, F uh, C and a lot of my friends went to univert, University of Michigan C but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, F uh, were looking for a southern school C and, F uh, C also U of M seemed overwhelming in size C and, F uh, what about you? F Oh, D so you're from the Midwest, too. F Uh, I live in Texas now. Where are you? F Oh, F uh, my brother's in Austin. F Uh, he lives Lakeway. He, F uh, had moved, F uh, we're in Plano. C And, F Oh, Austin is so pretty. I really like it <<very faint>>. C And your daughter is going to be a sophomore. Is, F uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas? <Laughter>. Oh. Yes. Uhhuh. Those, C and those were several, F uh, that we did consider. F Uh, my parents, F uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south C and because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I, when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it. C And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of oneonone F uh, E or small group situations. C And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology C and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe. F Uh, I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year C and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing C and I ended up majoring in French. One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department. They also had a strong language department C and I'd always loved working with children. F Uh, C and I found that I couldn't fit everything in, C but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me. F Uh, C and so that was some of, C but several of the things you mentioned were the things that, F uh, our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M. He, C but he thinks he wants to be a writer C and I don't think that, Yes <laughter>. F Uh, C and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand. F Uh, C and so he's used to a bigger size C and C because my brother is there, F uh, he would have family, close by. C So there, there are advantages. F Uh, C but I also, C because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan, which was so large C and they really felt, F uh, like they were numbers. You still, Yeah. D Well, th, that's certainly, F uh, especially today with the cost of college. E I mean that is a, a major, F uh, consideration C and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools. C And even though Baylor, F uh, C and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends who have children there who just love it. C And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are C and it is a smaller size C and, F uh, I do feel like there are a lot of options. It's, it's, C but <throat_clearing>, I had been hoping some schools I know give, F uh, F oh, even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, F uh, Yes, he thinks that's what he'd like to do, C but he's really strong in math and science, too, C and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind. Does your daughter know what she'd like to do? Yeah. Yes. Uhhuh. Yes. D Well, he, C but he has even, now that he's in high school, F uh, C and, of course, there's, there is still time, C but he's beginning to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it. D You know, it's, the, it's, Okay. D Well, did you go to college? C And where did you go? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I went to the University of Minnesota. I am, uhhuh. Where do you live now? D Well, I'm in Texas. I'm in Austin. Uhhuh. I'm familiar with Plano. I visited once or twice. F Oh, I love it. I love it. I really do. That's correct. I have two daughters, C but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore. She has her heart set on U T. C And, F uh, D you know, having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what a big university is like. C And, F uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I thought might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved in band, C and Baylor has a band camp. C So she went for a week, C and it was overnight, C and they lived in the dorms. C And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's, D you know, like on a coll, a smaller college campus. C And, F uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school. C So, F uh, I, I, I still think the exposure was good. The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, D well, D you know, what were your selection criteria. Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford C or, D you know, there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision. F Oh, wow. F Oh, definitely. Uhhuh. F Oh, how exciting. Uhhuh. F Oh, that was, That worked out very well for you. D Well, then he should come to U T. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Large classes. F Oh, I went from a large high school to a u, large university C and I definitely felt like I was a number. F Uh, E I mean, it is a different feeling. C But that was, that was my only option. E I, I mean, I just really couldn't look at anything else. That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a jun, D you know, a junior college, which I didn't want to do. D So that's how, D you know, my decision was made. C But, F uh, Yes. What, what does, he hopes to be a writer. F Huh. F Oh, she, she has, F uh, D you know, interests that are just, D you know, going in all directions. F Uh, <lipsmack> what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is <laughter>, okay Bethany, let's be real <laughter>. F Uh, <lipsmack> she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point. C And, I don't know, she's taken a lot of French, C and she may end up doing something with that. C And I am a single mom, D so I've been, C and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married. C So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake. C And I'm, D you know, showing them if you're strong in math C and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money. D You know. E I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, D you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy. By all means, go get that piece of paper, D you know. Do you just have one son? I see. D Well, it sounds like he's got some really, D you know, good strong ideas of what he wants to do.
