<Static> Okay, I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking. Do you enjoy cooking? <Laughter>. I'm kind of that way, too. When I have, I, I enjoy cooking when I have time. I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday <laughter>. It gets kind of boring. How big is the family you cook for? Uhhuh. We have four, C so, C and two of them are teenage boys, D so <laughter>. Are they? <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have that problem too. C But also, now it's just the amount that they eat. It's just absolutely incredible <laughter>. Yeah. Does he? <Laughter>. . Yeah. <Laughter>. That's true. F Uh, do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal? Favorite recipes that you've come across or, Uhhuh. Out on the grill? Uhhuh. Ooh <laughter>. Uhhuh. How, F Ooh, yeah. F Ooh, that's sound good. I love that. My husband really likes seafood. F Um, C and, I think that no matter what I do, I don't serve enough of it, really, to, F uh, to suit him. I didn't grow up eating that much seafood C and, F uh, C so I don't know, it's just kind of not natural to me C but I like it. C And, F uh, <lipsmack> I don't know, one of his favorite things is, F uh, D well it's called seafood stew C and it's really, it's really like a s, soup that, that you serve over rice. C And, F uh, it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it. C And, No, no. That's kind of Louisiana I think if you do that. Yeah, I don't either <laughter>. C But, F uh, no this is just re, it is really good C and, C and one thing that's good is it makes the, a large amount. C And so I've, usually we eat one C and I freeze two containers of it. Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice. C But neither of my kids will eat it. D You know, C so then they eat a pizza or <laughter>. Yeah, it really does. One thing I've run across, <<pause>> <lipsmack> recently though, a friend gave me a recipe that I really D like for chicken enchiladas. Have you made them? Does he, F ooh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, are, these are done with a flour tortilla. Is that what he uses? Yeah. Isn't that something? Yeah. I was going to say, my kids both eat it. I guess that's one thing that I particularly like, F um. C But I think it's good for, D you know, for, for company, too, C and I've made it a few times. F Um, C and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to, F uh, to give somebody. D You know, D like, D you know, to take over to somebody's house or something else. It, it's nice when it makes, a lot because you can feed your own family C and then, Uhhuh. What, what does it have in it? Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Sometimes those are the best ones, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Ooh, that sounds good. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Those are good aren't they? <<Very faintly>>. Uhhuh. F Um. That sounds good. Right. You cook the rice before you put it in? Yeah. I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really, kind of gives it a tang that would be good. I guess I would now use the, the new mayonnaise free. Yeah. That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because D like I told my husband this summer, I love to eat, D you know, chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that C and, C and, D you know, basically it certainly a l, low calorie, D you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing. D You know C and now it's, it's, it's okay C and you can even, I used to just put a tiny bit in. D Well now, I'm just putting more and more in <laughter>. Yeah, C and it's only, it used to be like a hun, hundred calories per tablespoon C and now it's like twelve. Oh! I just think that's the best thing to have happened, I'm just so excited about that. D Anyway <<very faintly>>. Yeah. Yes <laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. That's when they, As our family would say, a pig out <laughter>. <Laughter> That's good. F Oh, one of my boys that, that's, twelve, F um, <lipsmack> is, has high cholesterol. Have you ever found out about your kids. F Um, C and my other one does not. D So, F oh, year or so ago he found out C and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down. And did! He was able to get it down. It's, I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol. He's never eaten any eggs. He's never had anything but skim milk C and D you know, I've never bought butter <laughter> and things like that. C But, F um, <sniffing> F oh, he just left for the doctor again C and it's, it's kind of back up. F Um, C so he needs to be careful again. C So we've really been talking about the foods, D you know, for him to, to be sure to eat C and, F uh, C so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days <laughter>. C And all that kind of stuff does really help. D Well, I think we've probably talked long enough C and <static> <<voices fade>>. Alright <Noise>. Sometimes, not all the time <laughter>. Right. <Children> Yeah, that, that's about the same boat I'm in, too. Yeah. F Uh, five. F Oh, D well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys, too. C So, C And they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have. F Huh. <Breathing>. F Oh yeah, D well D see, I, m, my oldest is nine C and he already he already does that <noise>. C And I told him he's going to have to get a parttime job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat. F Um, <Breathing> My husband and I, our favorite meal is, F uh, C and we do it D like for special stuff celebrations and, we have D like steak C and he does the steak C and then F uh, Uhhuh. C And he marinates it in his special stuff that he does. C And it's real good. C And, F uh, I do sauteed mushrooms, C so <<very faintly>> and asparagus. C And that's our favorite, dinner. <Noise> Yeah, so do we <noise> <<sounds like a lighter>>. Yeah. Uhhuh. It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it, is it? I don't know what that, I don't see how you eat that, C but <Noise>. Oh. Yeah. C So it, Yeah, it defeats the purpose. F Oh yeah. Yeah. My husband makes those. I'm not, I don't eat enchiladas. I, I don't like enchila, I don't like the tex, I don't know, I guess it's the texture, or something. I don't like the taste of enchiladas. C But everyone else in my family does. Yeah. I don't know, I, it's, I don't know what, I don't know. I, I don't know what it is about the enchiladas. I just, <sigh> C and I'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother. I'm the only one that doesn't eat it <noise>. C But, my kids love it. Uhhuh. Yeah <noise>. <Breathing>. Yeah. Yeah, I've got a chicken casserole that's like that, that, that I've, <Breathing>. Yeah, C because I, when I make this chicken casserole I, it, it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze. C So, C or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not going to eat, It's jus, you can use chicken or turkey, C because my Mom started making it D like right after Thanksgiving C and using the leftover turkey. C And it's rice and,, when I do recipes I just throw stuff in. I don't, I'm not real good about measuring C because I just, I do it to taste. C And, D Well yeah, C but it, it's D like, it's just chicken, it, it's, as much as you want, D you know torn up and, and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery C and that's it, and some hardboiled eggs. C And that's it. You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to, D you know, heat it through. C And you sprinkle, F uh, that, those, F uh, toasted onion rings. On top of it for the crunchy. C And that's it, D you know <<very faintly>>. C And it, it, it goes C and it's filling because of the rice. D So, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it gives it a, an extra D yeah, little tang. Yeah, that cholesterol fat free? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Noise> I know. I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it. Yeah. I know. Yeah, we did the lowcal stuff. D Well with my kids I don't, they get enough sugar and stuff anyway. Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway. C And they don't need any added help. C So, when we're here at home, D you know, with sweets and stuff, they, they don't, we don't really do that much. I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and D you know, stuff like that. C And, C and drink wise they have KoolAid, milk or water. Normally. D Now when they go to their grandmother's house, which is every weekend. It's a, it's a different <<pause>> a different story all around. Uhhuh. That's exactly what it is. F Oh really? No, not yet. F Huh. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. The lower cholesterol foods and stuff <noise>. <Laughter> <children>.
