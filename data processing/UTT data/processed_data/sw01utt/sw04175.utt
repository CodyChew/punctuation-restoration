<Laughter> I don't believe that we're, <Breathing> The recycling program here is just terrible. E I mean it's hard to find places to go. E I mean, Kroger does a couple things. They, I don't think they, do they do newspapers? Yeah. The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and, F uh, D you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, D you know, like soup comes in and stuff. They pick up everything. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. I know it, I know it. It piles up. <Snorting>. <Laughter>. I just don't know. I just don't know C and now they have, D like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, E mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff. Uhhuh. I know it, I know it. F Oh, yeah. The, Uhhuh. D Well, E I mean, it's real, <breathing> you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything. C And since we go there all the time, E I mean probably at all. <Laughter>. F Oh, by the way, may name's Julie. Hi. I'm from Atlanta. Neat. <Laughter>. I just think that everybody ought to do it. The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, they have, F uh, <breathing> F uh, what I, what I used to, F uh, now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, C but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time C and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over. C A, C but, also most places, like Big Star does C and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not C but, Yeah, C and they, they have D like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in. Can bring them in. I know it, I know it. <Laughter>. It really is a small, <Laughter> hostile planet <laughter>. Did you know that, No, really not. Did you know that, D like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is D like paper? Filled with paper. F Huh? D Well, it is, it is, though. It is, because they, D Well, they do treat paper with chemicals D like yellow paper, D you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. D You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a couple of weeks. Yeah it will be whole. You'll be able to read off of it. Yeah, F um. <Laughter>. W, D Well, white paper's bad too. They, they treat it, too. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. Maybe. Yeah. You think? I don't know, D well, E I mean, I think we've kind of, D you know, E I mean, everybody, everybody <Laughter> everybody has a computer. We would no longer need paper at all. <Laughter>. I would love that. D So what do you think about, F uh, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie? I don't know, there's, there's big bins out there, I don't know if they ever get <breathing>, I, I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, D you know, thing to you, C but, I think there should be some kind of curbside service. That's the only way I could really, Uhhuh. During the summers, D like the, around where I live the, F uh, homeless people see, E I mean, they all have D like shopping carts and stuff C and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff, C and so we used to just save them up C and then they'd come around C and we'd give them to them. C But, when, during the winter time I think they, they move south or something C so, I don't do that anymore. C And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, F uh, outside the, F uh, student center they never empty those things. They just overflow. D So what's a guy to do? D You know. <Laughter>. I asked myself. Really? F Huh, F oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient. Inconvenient, even <laughter>. C But, F uh, D so, you do recycle, don't you? Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it. If I, if see a, s, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there <laughter>, C but I don't really, I don't ever take anything. Uhhuh. <Laughter> C But wait I've never seen you before <laughter>. Who are you? Yeah, my name's Bill. D Well, Hi. Me, too. Crazy. F Uh, D well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie? Do they do D like, what about, D like, F uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know? Really? What about like those grocery bags? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. F uh. Those petroleum products are going to kill us. The hostile planet, I think, Julie. <Laughter>. The petroleum pretty much, E I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, F uh, E you know the great Satan of the recycling. F Um. Paper just seems so innocuous. Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, D you know. It comes from trees. How can it be bad? They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it. Yep. F Oh <<faint>>. Really? F Huh. I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads, then. I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work C and, F uh, C But I can just forget that from now on. I'm going u, I'm going to switch to the white ones. D Well, what about, F uh, papyrus, D you know, made out of bam, D you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the banks of the Nile. You think so? Tablets? I think we should just abandon the, D you know, the written word altogether, D you know. What do you think? Kind of radical, I know C but, <Laughter>. That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V s on their wrist, like, F uh, Dick Tracy.
