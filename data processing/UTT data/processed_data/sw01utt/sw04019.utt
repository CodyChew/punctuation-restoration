Okay, F um, Chuck, do you have any pets there at your home? C And what kind do you have? Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. D Well, we have a cat, F um, he's probably, F oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby. <Laughter> F Oh. F Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, yeah, he's, F uh, he has been really aggressive, F uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason. He's, F uh, been so mean to her <laughter>. We've had him for about two years C and he was so mean to her, F um, right after we first got him. D So we had him neutered, and, and declawed, C and now he bites her. <laughter> He can't scratch her any more, he bites her. Yeah, yeah, he has a couple of times, C so. C But he's a very possessive cat. He, he loves my son, it's his cat, C and he's the only one that allows him to touch him C or pet him C or love him C and he's so funny, he just follows my son around just like a dog. He won't even let my son shower. He meows and wants to get in the bathroom C and, while he showers, it's so hilarious. C So he's quite a animal <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, D well, we, we did, F uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, D you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl, C but, F uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit, C and we do keep our daughter away from him. C So. <Laughter> Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house <laughter>. It is, uhhuh. We, we tried a dog about four years ago, C and we ended up with, F uh, F oh, malamute and some other kind of mix. Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home. C So, we gave him up and tried. Yes, uhhuh, we're in a house, C but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog, we couldn't allow him to run free, C so, he was just chained up all the time, C and it was, it was unfortunate. D So have you tried any other pets? F Oh <laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. F Oh, my word. C And do they, they just paper train it or something? <Laughter>. Yeah. <laughter> D Well, rabbits are darling. That would be fun if you could get them trained. Otherwise they're pretty smelly <laughter>. F Oh. Huhuh, we don't have C, we don't have cable. F Oh. F Oh. Is that right? F Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> D Well, I'd be, interesting to watch. Yes, uhhuh. Elton. We live <noise> out here by, it's by Ogden. It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah C and we really love it out here. It's, F uh, kind of country. We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden. C So, we're kind of country but not too. No, huhuh. Do you? F Oh, D well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas. F Oh, D well, great. Yeah, I've been doing it for about two weeks C and, F uh, no my, No my, Yeah, I do. I've got a male Siamese about a year old here. I live alone in an apartment, and, F uh, except for the cat. How about you? Uhhuh. D Well, it's, F uh, D you know they're just, F uh, aggressive by nature C and, F uh, he's been neutered and declawed, C so he's an indoor cat, C so, F uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part. How about yours? F Huh. C And, C and you say you've had him how long? Two years. F Huh. Does he bite her enough to draw blood? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Yeah, boy, I guess. D Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right. You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah, yeah. Is that the only pet that you have? D Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, F uh, I see. Sure. No, no. I, I live alone in an apartment, C and, F uh, it's, it's not that big that, F uh although I've heard rabbits are pretty good D you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses, C and they apparently, F uh, especially when they're young when they bring them in F uh, <laughter>. I guess. I guess, yeah, C and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either. Yep, that's right. Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, F uh, I see. D Well they have, F uh, F uh, a Wesmin, they call it the Westminster Dog Show, F uh, <child_talking> I think it's in New York City at the, at the Gardens there once a year live C and they had that on last week, C and that's really kind of something to watch, F uh, it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two C and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there. Some of them are really beautiful, too. D So. D So you live in Utah do you? Goodness. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well do you all work for T I, or for, Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the very first one I've, I've talked to. Uhhuh.
