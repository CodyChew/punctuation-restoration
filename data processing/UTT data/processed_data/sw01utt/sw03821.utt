D Well, credit cards <laughter>. I'll tell you what, I, I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I, F uh, tore mine up. Yeah, F uh, I got in some problems with, F uh, <sniffing> financial problems because of credit cards C so I, F uh, basically just got rid of all of them. I, I have a, a couple. I have a, F uh, gas card that I, that I use just for gas and D you know, F uh, one that I use just for <sniffing> emergencies C but, Yeah. I know it. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. F Oh, is that right? That's a, that's a good policy. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, sometimes I wish I had them, C but in most cases, I'm glad I don't because I, D you know, unfortunately I, I, I don't have the control you have <laughter>. I wish I did, C but C but I don't. F Uh, C and it, D you know, it, I just don't want to get into that situation again, C so we'll, F Oh, that's it. D See, C and that's, even with my gas card D you know, I find that I'll go in to get some gas C and I'll end up buying, D you know, <sniffing> candy and drinks and D you know, sweets and whatever, C and then at the end of the month I, D you know, I get a bill C and I'm thinking what did I get, that costs so much. C And, <Sniffing>. Yeah, that, that's true, C but I can, I can under, certainly understand where <sniffing>, D You know, F Oh, yeah. Isn't it, that's unbelievable. How, let me ask you this. How, how old are you? Thirtythree? Okay. <Sniffing> You'll be thirtythree this year? <Laughter> You want to be thirtytwo as long as you can, F huh. <Laughter> It's coming. Yeah, I, I know what you mean about the interest rates. It's, F uh, it's unbelievable. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. F Oh, jeez. <Sniffing>. Yeah, C and then, you bet. That's, F uh, yeah, I, in fact, I've, I've even, F uh, heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less, F uh rates and have paid off their, D you know higher interest rate, F uh cards and just sent them back, D you know. C And I, I guess there's some, there's, F uh, F uh, some negotiating there, too, C because I heard, F uh, on one of the local talk shows here, they had somebody on and, and said, what you can do is, F uh, call, D you know, if you've got a pretty good rating, F uh, credit rating you can call your in, D you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from and tell them, hey, either drop my rates or drop my, D you know, F uh annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else. D You know, C and if you've got, if you've got a pretty good F uh, F uh, history with them they're more than willing to do that. Yeah, in fact, that's, that's what this guy, D you know, he wrote a book on it C and he says that's, D you know, he's tried it sev, with several of his cards C and he's just told them, D you know, I, I can get this card from this bank at this rate C and yours is at, D you know, eighteen or nineteen percent. It does not make sense for me to do that C and if you won't drop my rates, I'll just go ahead and send you back your card C and I'll go somewhere else and get it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Is that right? I, I know pe, I know some other people that have done that. F Um. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Uhhuh, yeah, I h, I have, we have some, some friends that did the, exactly the same thing. They, F uh, D you know, they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed C and finally they realized that they were, they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole C and they just cut them all up except for, for one they kept for emergencies C and they're still paying away to get out of debt. C But, no, I did just the opposite. I, I guess I, I sort of followed in my, F uh, parents' footsteps. I have quite a few of them. I use them continually, C but I, F uh, I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for. C And, F uh, C and I always pay them off totally every month. Yeah. Yeah, C and it, D you know, E I mean, they, they're just a convenience for me. I don't have to get cash out of the bank, C and I don't have to <laughter> to be writing checks C and C and, F uh, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, E I mean, it, it's easy, E I mean, you don't have anything transferring, just a little signature, so what, D you know <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Surprising. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, D you know, C but the, E I mean, there are sort some inherent limits there, you're not going to, you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that, right. D Now I, W, the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really, D you know, <laughter> F uh, not so much discipline, E I mean, D well, E I mean, you have sort of a discipline in general about finances, C but, C but I hate their, their rates so badly, E I mean their interest rates so badly that I, I'm, F uh, thirtythree. Thirtytwo, excuse me. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D You know, I just, that just irritates me so much that, that I refuse to pay them interest C and, C and my wife recently, F uh, decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off C and, she's from there and and, F uh, didn't really have the money, C but, D you know, she could pay it off, C and so I, sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards, C but she's paying it, C and, F uh, I just won't do it. E I mean, she's paying, I don't know, I don't know what per month, D you know, forty, fifty dollars per month in interest C and I just, D you know, I just refuse to give it to them. If I need to borrow that kind of money, I'll go to the bank C and, F uh, D You know. Income. F Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. High, I might, F Um. Right. F Um, I might try that because I, I have one card that I've had for about, F uh, I don't know, nine or ten years. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, for me the big thing, D you know, is the, F uh, F uh, is the annual fee C and I just refuse, I won't get any card now, I've, I've got a good rating C and I've got, <laughter> D you know, C And I'm not going, I'm not going to pay an annual fee. The only one I actually pay on is this one that I, that, the very first,
