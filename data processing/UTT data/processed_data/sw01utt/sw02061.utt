<Music> Hello. Hey, how you doing? Fernando. Wait. Let me turn off my stereo here <music>. C Because I've been, D like, waiting, D like, for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody. Yeah. Yeah. What time is it over th, are you, are you in Dallas? Are you? Because every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas. Yeah. I'm in North Carolina. On the other coast <laughter>. What? Yeah, yeah. It's, F uh, I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here. W, wait. Wh, what did, how, how did you get to know about the T I thing? Wha, what are you working on <breathing>? Really. I'm doing my Masters in, in computer science and computer engineering. At North Carolina State University. F Uh, I don't. Because, F uh, I come from a lot, a bigger city than this one C and I, I'm in Raleigh C and, Yeah. That area. C And it's really small. All, all you have is like towns built around universities. Like Chapel Hill? Yeah. Where you at? F Oh, okay. D So, D so E I mean, it's like this, this town probably has D like two hundred and fifty thousand people C and that's about it. Yeah. F Oh, okay. D So, D so where do you go? Do you go to Berkeley? F Oh, okay. Because, F uh, I was looking at, at the, doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley <sigh>. C And they're asking D like for a, F uh, G P A of like three point seven or something like that. C And D like they're looking D like for, F uh, G R E like ninetynine percentile and this and that. C And it's like, <Swallowing> Yeah, I know. That's why, that's why I didn't apply. E I mean, it was D like for me, it was D like practically impossible to get between D like ninety and, ninetynine percentile on the, on the verbal part. Yeah. D So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate? Yeah. When do you get out? F Oh, okay <laughter>. C But, F uh, C but what if they pay for it? <Swallowing> What if they pay for? Yeah. Because I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, F uh, <inhaling> the Army. F Uh, I think, I think they're military. C But, E I mean, the guy is still in. C And, F uh, h, F uh, he works over in Maryland <swallowing>. C And so he's doing his Masters here. They gave him D like a scholarship D like for a year. C And he's doing it in D like, in a year and a summer. C And so he's getting that C and, F uh they said D like they got a lot of benefits and that. That's why you want to join. C But, F uh, this guy, E I mean you can earn a lot more money C so you say, I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters. They go, D well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it C so. Yeah. C But E I mean, E I mean, you, the, once you get your Masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between D like thirtyseven, fortyfive thousand a year. C And C and that's not what they're paying. Yeah. Yeah, I know <laughter>. Yeah. C But that's, F uh, Yeah. It's like, it's like, F uh, in I B M. In I B M, you can get certain points C and, F uh, everyone's a manager. C But nobody can get one more point to become, D you know, D like whatever you need to earn so much money. Yeah. It's like, no E I, I mean, I B M is like, there's a joke about I B M which says, D you know, it's like, F uh, all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right? C And so, I B M says D well we have, we have to have a team, right. C And then they come in last C and they have this whole team, D you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it. Saying, he goes, F uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right. C So he goes, have you come up with a lution, F uh, have you come up with a solution? They go, yeah, change the rower <laughter>. D You know, it's like everyone's a, manager C but, D you know, it's like only use D like one person does the work C so. Yeah. D So. Yeah. D Well, that's the way it works. E I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems. E I mean, everyone's a manager C and, Yeah. E I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there are, F uh, very few. C And then the other people just plan it, D you know. It's like, it's like have you, have have you ever seen the commercial D like for Federal Express where the, with, F uh, the think tank? D You know, D like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, D you know, D like what shall we do? Has anybody thought of anything? No. C And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along. They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world C and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time. C And so it's D like the same thing with I B M. D You know, C so they have this think tank. C And they got to come up with ideas. C But, D see, F uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff. Yeah. C And it fails C and you're dead. Yeah. D Well I B M doesn't fire anybody. C Because F uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job. Which y, you actually are like sitting around not doing anything. C So you quit. E I mean that's their policy. They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally. Yeah, D like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that <swallowing>. C But they won't let you off. What they'll do is D like <sigh> suppose, D you know, D like you're a manager. C So they'll put you into keeping up the paper, D you know. It's like how much paper is going in? C And then you say that's not my job, C so you quit. Right. Right. Right. No, C but E I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just D like different policy. I don't know. My dad works for them C but it's like I B M D like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, D you know. It's like they won't say, Yeah. C Because D see what happens is they have a good backup policy. C And anybody can fix it. C And so that's what you're going to go for. C And, C and, D you know, it's like, for example, D like Leading Edge. Have you ever heard of Leading Edge? What? They, they made D like, F uh, small personal computers. I don't know. I don't know. C But what they do is, what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away. Yeah. for example, you test a chip. It can't last seven years C but it can last five. I B M says let's throw it away. Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you. C And so that's, E I mean, they're still around I think. <Clicking> <swallowing> C So, that's what they do. They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away C and they, C and that's why they're so compatible. Because E I mean C and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway. D You know. D Well, E I mean, there's D like, D well in a way you realize, E I mean, one t, one of my teachers got this computer which, D you know, it's D like, F uh, voice, F uh, synthesizing stuff. C And he got that. He said, D you know, it's like, F uh, <swallowing> I was testing it C and it was wonderful. C And then when you tried to erase and correct, D you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory. C And I want more, D you know. C And it's like Jesus Christ, D you know, it's like why do you want more. Because it's D like one second of recording. E I mean you put into Wave C and you want to correct the errors into Wave, it takes so much, E I mean, it's like, of course it does. E I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model C and you put it in there, C and you want to correct those. C And then, D you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth C so you can approximately, of course it's going to take a lot. Imagine, imagine what it is for us to make mark off models, D you know. It's like, <laughter> Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, like they say, D like nobody can get enough, D you know. It's like once you have something, C and it's like I was watching this program on T V yesterday. In nineteen seventysix NASA came up with Three D graphics. Right. C And they were showing this D like Three D g, Three D graphics view of D like, What? No, no, no. This is like, this is like video game stuff. Okay? C But the only thing was, that it was just lines, okay. Like if you <breathing>, Hello. Not bad, not bad. What's your name? Fernando. My name is Nick. Sure <cough>. Really? Phew <<almost like a whistling sound>>. Man, I'm, No, no. I'm in Detroit. C Or not Detroit. I'm in, F uh, California. Yeah. I. Really? Oh. D Well, you're on the, F uh, let's see, Yeah, twentyone <<sounds like he is talking to someone other than speaker>>. Yeah. Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost? Yeah, <laughter> okay. All right. D Well I guess we're supposed to talk, what about credit card? F Oh, one of my instructors, F uh, said that they were doing something like this C and. A, a Masters in, F uh, information systems. Yeah? Where at? Hey. How do you like it out there <clicking>? Yeah. Oh. Raleigh Durham. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C So it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway. Kind of quaint little towns C but they don't have a whole lot there. F Uh, D well, I'm in Monterey, California right now <barking>. Yeah. Two hundred fifty? Okay. It, it's, it's a lot bigger than Monterey is. C But we're just, F uh, just south of, F uh, San Jose and San Francisco. C And it's only a couple of hours away E or a hour away to a, D you know, to a large city. No, no. I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here. <Cough>. Uhhuh. <Thumping> Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that's what they look for. Whether or not they get it is hard to say <noise> <<sounds like a chair is drug across the floor>>. * spelling Yeah <talking>. <Talking>. Yeah. It's pretty tough. It's pretty tough <talking>. I, F uh, let's face it, D you know. C And, D you know, I, D you know, did the, D you know, as far as, I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, D you know, the school only takes you so far, D you know. It's what you do. You know. C So, F uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that. Probably not. D See I'm in the Navy. C And, F uh, D you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I, if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy. F Oh, probably be another twelve years. F Oh, D you know I like what I'm doing right now. Excuse me? If they pay for a P H D? Nah, they won't pay for it. They've, I think they have maybe two people a year go get, get their P H D. Yeah. They civilians or, F uh, military? Uhhuh <popping>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <talking>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, a lot of times it's, D you know, a lot of times it's not the money <barking> that keeps pe, that keeps people in. They, they like what they're doing. They, D you know, they feel good about what they're doing. That type of thing. It's more <popping>, Uhhuh <barking>. F Oh, easily, I'm sure. No. D Well, it depends on what rank you are, of course <barking>. E I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, D you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, D you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year. Yeah. Those are few and far between though. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Since I imagine it's fairly competitive. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <noise>. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Yeah. I don't know, that can be, that, that can really slow you down. I didn't realize that. Uhhuh. push paper around. Uhhuh. <Cough>. Uhhuh. <Popping> Yeah. F Oh, yeah. They've got a, they've got basically a, F uh, D you know, a lock on a lot of the market. C And a lot of times you figure, D you know, with the support that they provide, D you know, people generally go with that because they figure that the, D you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material. Where's if you try something different, they'll they'll say yeah, why didn't you buy, why didn't you try something more mainline. <Throat_clearing> No. Uhhuh. F Uh. Illegal or something like that, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So, in other words, that's the way they force people out <cough>. That's why they can say, D you know, there's no layoff policy. C But it does, they don't really say that, D you know, you're, you're always going to have great career conditions. He, hey, that's kind of sad. No. D Well, they're the standard right now. C Or as far as that goes, D you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times. C And the main, <Cough>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, D you know, that's, that's a, that's a big thing. Yeah. They are out of Korea right. Leading Edge. Don't they pro, Yeah. Small P C s. they're out of Korea right? Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. <Cough>. Okay. Yeah. I've seen, D well I've seen them around anyway. D You know. Uhhuh. Most people do. C Or they have to anyway. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. It's amazing. Yeah. D Well, when you get, D you know, when you get right down to it, the, F uh, the more they can do for you, the more, F uh, D like E I say, the more, the more memory they're going to require. Yeah. Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, F uh, D you know, standard memory or disk mem, disk base, C so. F Oh, yeah. You find out more, Yeah. Uhhuh. Like the deal? Like a hologram? With just graphics on, on a, Okay <cough>.
