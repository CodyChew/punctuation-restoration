Okay, F um. How has it been this week for you? Weatherwise. <Laughter> F Oh, no, damp. Uhhuh. My goodness. D Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then. It was ninetysix yesterday, <Laughter> C and we set a record yesterday. And, F uh, very windy, C but then today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, F uh, I think right now it's like sixtynine, C and that's cool for u, C or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant, no rain in the last month, I don't think. The ground's very dry C and our yard work, everything is in bloom, C so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry, C but I guess it also, F uh, brings about allergies, we're having a lot of allergies down here right now. Everything blooming, C and, C and the weather. C And, F uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, F uh, spring fever too, D so. Had a lot of people out at work, D you know, for fishing, and, and F uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that. Yeah. Yes. F Um. F Um. F Uh. Yeah. Uhhuh. No snow? F Um. F Um. F Um. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yes, yes it is. Down in the more southern and western areas. C And, of course we are, F um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south, C and, C and, F uh, very windy. It's amazing to me C because I have only lived in Dallas for three years, C and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time. It does, I, I very seldom, if any, I can't remember, D you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing. F Um. F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, rea, where did you go to school in Indiana? Purdue. I have a brother that lives in, F uh, F uh, South Bend, Indiana. C And, I had to always, I've lived there for eight years myself. I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame. C But, I didn't. F Uh. No, originally I'm from New Mexico. I was born in New Mexico C and we lived in, F uh, South Bend for eighty, eight years, and, F uh, then moved to, F uh, Tennessee D actually. C And, F uh, <Laughter> Very much, very much, C cause I, I spent thirteen years there. C And, F uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago. C So, <Laughter> Yeah, F uh, my father was in the Air Force, C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Right. Yeah <breathing>. It's, F um, it's just as long as you want to. E I mean it's just, F uh, as long as you want to, and just, D you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation. F Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments? F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Yeah. D Well, D actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments, C and, F uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer, C and, F uh, <static> they just published this internally, D you know, getting people involved. D So, that, that's really strange. I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though. I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well. Yeah, yeah. D Well, really it, <static> F uh, the letter just says, F um, let's see, I can't, I was looking at it, I was trying to find out speedy short cuts, C and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed. C So. Uhhuh. F Uh, D well, it's actually, F um, waste water. Taking, taking care of F uh, I'm actually in the air division, C and we monitor, F um, <static> anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building, C or, F um, we do have customers that, F um, their concerns are in the work place C and we take care of that, C but, within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, F uh, solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and <sigh>, F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, we D actually, our division is corporate wide, C and we take care of just the Dallas area. Of course we have several plants here, C but, F um, we do air modeling also. C And, C and, D yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area. What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, D you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, C and, F uh, we have a huge chemical data base. And, F uh, our, <static> our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site C and, C and, F um, it's concentration, C and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, D you know, a building explosion or something tha, we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station. Weatherwise, or otherwise? Weatherwise. Damp, cold, warm <laughter>. We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, F uh, in the last week. We have had highs of seventytwo, lows in the twenties. <Laughter>. I heard about that. F Um <music>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. The blue flu, yeah, the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess. F Oh, we have had, F uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. F Uh, It has been untypically wet for this time of year, C and, also, we have a lot of green, D you know, the grass has been growing C and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those lines, C but fortunately it rains C and you, F uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, D you know. C But, we've had an unusually, F uh, F uh, warm spring, C and, D well I guess we're still in winter, C and, F uh, we have had no snow. To speak of, to speak of. We usually average, F oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter C and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation. C So, it's been inordinately warm, F uh, here, for, F uh, for this time of year. C So, F uh, in that regard, it's fine, C but, F uh, I envy you your ninetyfour degrees. I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh D Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands, C and it was that way every day. Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter, C so, that, F uh, you, you became accustomed to it, I guess. C But, F uh, otherwise w, as I said, we have had, F uh, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country. Purdue. F Oh, yes. <Laughter>. D Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. D Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere. Uhhuh. Gee, you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have <laughter>. F Oh, I see. D Well, I worked for the government, C so I, I moved, F uh, much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years, C but, F uh, I guess the, F uh, this is my first conversation in this, F uh, F uh, series. I, I received a call last night because of the, F uh, I had not received my, F uh, personal identification number. C So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line. D So, F uh, is there any, I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk. F Oh. F O, No, I do not. I work for G T E. C And, I, F uh, of course, was, I was sent a, F uh, an application from, F uh, from Jack. I've known Jack for some time. I'm in the speech processing business, and have been for a number of years, C so I was very much interested, in, in being a speaker for this <laughter>. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative, C and, F um, C but I have, F uh, I have been a speaker in other, F uh, similar type of activities. C And, I know the reason why this is, why the, F uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth, C so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker. We haven't talked much about the weather <laughter>. I know that's what we're supposed to do. Uhhuh. In environmental engineering, F uh, is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, D you know, environm, the work place environment C or, F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. D Well, I had my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, F uh, concerning recycling <static>, in the community. The call I received, C and so, I had, F uh, I had thought a little bit about it, F um, before hand. C So, I, <laughter> C but that, that's interesting. I have a, F uh, F uh, friend who is a planner. F Uh, a city planner. C And, one of his, C and he models, F uh, city districts, and so forth, F uh, does computer modeling. C And, one of the, F uh, he has inputs, E or gets inputs from, F uh, an environmental engineer.. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. D Well, that's interesting.
