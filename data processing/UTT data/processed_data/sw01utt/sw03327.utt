Okay, is it Mike? Do you repair your own car? D Well, I tell you what, that's, y, count your blessings because F uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves. D Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like. Because they are, E I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they? <Barking>. Uhhuh. Is that right? <Laughter>. Yeah, I, I agree. About all I ever, I never was too mechanically inclined, C but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and, Course, they don't use, F uh, <noise> points anymore. C But, <Laughter> F Uh, they do still use plugs. C And, F uh, D now brakes, I've always done a lot of, D you know, changing brakes. <Lipsmack> C And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, D you know, and starter. I don't anymore, C but I have on a lot, a lot of times. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It probably slipped loose, didn't it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh. <Throat_clearing>. Y, D well, it really wasn't quite, s, as bad as you thought, was it, was it? D Well, it was a lot of money, C but, You had to have the help, didn't you? Yeah. D Well, do you still do much work on them, then? Disposal is a problem. That's true. That's true. Right, that, that, I've, I've quit doing that myself. C And, C but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, D you know. <Lipsmack> C And, F uh, C but, it, C but, no, I guess, i, that, C and the main reason that it's, it's quick. Yes. I try to, whenever I can. I've always been a, a <lipsmack>, I guess a product of a handyman father. Th, Yeah. Yeah. There's, a, although I'll tell you, D you know, over the years the cars get more complicated. Right, yeah. Yes. One of my first cars was a fiftysix Buick. Which, after awhile I could, D you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to. Yeah. It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand C and, now since then, D you know, the closer a car is to a fiftysix Buick, the, the more I know about it. C And then start getting into these Nissans and the like C and I just can't keep up. Yeah. That's right <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. Yes, I understand. My last car repair actually had to do with brakes C and it's one I did not do myself. I took the car, my, I have a seventynine El Dorado, took it to be inspected C and the parking brake failed. C So I got under there and messed with the, the ten, that, F uh, that adjustment to make, to t, tighten it up C and that didn't do the trick C and then I got there and tried to, D Well, D actually that wasn't even eventually the problem. I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do. C And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes C and it turns out that there's a, the parking brake i, in the rear, there's a, there's disc brakes C and the parking brake is a piston deal. C And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up. D So they ended up having to pound it out. C And one of them, they, were able to get running, F uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it C and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid, C so I ended up having to buy one C and altog, all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done <laughter>. Y, yeah, actually, I, I think it was a lot of money, C but I, I don't, like I s, Yeah, C but, I, it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on C so, That's right, that's right. I do. Th, D act, th, D actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September C and, whenever I can, I do try. I <throat_clearing> D a, D actually, I'd say this. I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because, D Well, that is one problem, C but also these, F uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them. For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a f, D you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, F uh, lube, too <noise>. Yeah. Yep, that's right.
