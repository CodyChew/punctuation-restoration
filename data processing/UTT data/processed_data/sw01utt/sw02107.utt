You said you have four cats? How old are they? F Oh gosh. I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years, I've had him probably five years. F Oh yes, I love my cats. I lost one, one time, F uh, the first one I got. He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment. C And he'd never been outside, D like, D you know, by himself outside. C And it started raining C and I was hysterical. I was, I was, E I mean, you would have thought a child had died. I called everyone I knew, I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat. C And they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical. F Oh yeah. <Laughter>. The cat was here first C so <laughter>. I know, it's hard. F Oh, how funny. <Laughter> That's sweet, I have the two, the other two cats I have are outdoor cats. C And they didn't used to be actually, C but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, C so I put them outside once I got a house C and they're doing great out there, they love it. C But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there. Other than that he gets scared to death. If you shut that door he goes into hiding. I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony <laughter>. C And Lord knows what happened to him. <laughter> He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares. Probably. Are they. F Oh no. F Oh my gosh. F Oh, I imagine. I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened. F Oh, I can imagine, what did he shoot him with. F Oh my gosh. People are crazy. F Oh Lord. F Oh man. I imagine. They usually are after something like that happens to them. It seems to mellow them or something. No. F Oh yeah, I ke, I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside, C and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back, C and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. C But I can't give them up. I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home. F Oh, F oh yeah, C and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. C And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. Uhhuh. Ugh! Really. <Laughter> It's here now, we have to keep it. Yeah, my, my first one that I got, I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely. C So I found this one C and, F uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drivethru that said free kittens. C And I thought <beep> well that's interesting, I'll call them. C And he was the only one left C and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens. C And he was the last one she carried across, D you know, the whole big sad story. C So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that. C And he is, F uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers. Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that C and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, C so. C But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him. He never meows, he, he doesn't have any front claws, I had him declawed, C but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile. <Laughter> F Oh yeah, yeah, we do, we call that doing biscuits, it looks like their kneading bread <laughter>. F Oh, I just love cats. I like dogs, they're okay, I had, I had a dog when I lived at home C but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually. F Oh yeah, they do. F Oh they are. I love it, it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities. C And they just act so funny. Really. Uhhuh. <Laughter> A train of cats running around. F Oh how funny, I can imagine. Yeah, I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death. What are your cats' names. F Oh, how sweet. I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal. Precious and Rascal are brother and sister C and they don't look a thing a like. Nothing. Precious is a medium hair yellow cat, C and Rascal is a black and white short hair. They don't look a thing a like, C and they came from the same litter and everything. Oh. <Laughter> So ugly she's cute, right. Really. Oh. Is she the oldest one? Really. F Oh I know it's like the end of the world. I know that's how I am about Xanadu. F Oh definitely. Yeah. You can walk a dog C and that's okay for weekend C but cats are good all the time. It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem <laughter>. Have you seen those, F uh, do you ever read COSMO. There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago C and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date C and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, D you know, they had ripped him up C and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats. C And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards. It was so funny. <Laughter> Watch me. Definitely. F Oh I wouldn't either. There'd be no way. F Oh really, <laughter> F oh D well. That's life, that's how life goes. I know, I love mine too. D Well, it's been nice talking to you. Me to. Bye, bye. Yes, I have four cats. D Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old. Yes. F Oh okay, you get so attached to them. Oh. F Oh no. Uhhuh. Yes, uhhuh. Yes, I understand. F Oh no, I understand, we, F uh, we've gone through the same things with ours, we've had, D you know, they've been ill, E I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, D you know, my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy. C And then we had a baby C and its like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby. C And, C and then when we go to sleep at night, D you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us. It's like all right, whose corners is this one. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh no. Yes, uhhuh, that's it <laughter>. Right, traumatized for life here. F Oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats. We started out with two, with two outdoor cats C but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them. F Oh D well he lived through it, F oh, I couldn't believe it. We went through D like twentytwo hundred dollars worth of vet bills. The, the cat almost died, C and C but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat, F oh he loves life now. C And he's like F oh, thank you so much. I know, we wondered about that. C But, F uh, F oh that was a traumatic experience for us too. F Uh, D well, F uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun C and then he started chasing him with a bull whip. F Oh yes, absolutely nuts. C But, F uh, luckily enough, D you know, we found the cat in time and, F uh, rushed him to the vet C and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery C and, tod, E I mean he started off as a stray C and then we did all this for him <laughter>. C But F oh, he's been a wonderful cat. F Oh yes. C But, F uh, we wouldn't ha, we wouldn't have them, E I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats. There's just, F uh, there's this, they just fill this void. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh no. Right C and you worry about, F oh, who's taking care of them. Uhhuh. Right, D well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night. We, we, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick. C And, F uh, D well I fell in love with this, F uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, F uh, brought him home, C and F oh, my husband just died. It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now. Uhhuh, uhhuh, yes. F Oh uhhuh. Right. F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. Right, right. F Oh no. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh that's good. F Oh we just, F uh, just love them. They, F uh, D you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey C and they'll come up C and just start kneading in our chest C and it's like F oh, your claws need trimming. F Oh yes, yes. F Oh it just drives us nuts. F Um, yeah. They really are. The cats are so independent C and they have so much more personality than a dog. C And, C but F oh, they're so much fun to watch them play. Yes. F Oh, we've got, D well the two that were outside, they're like brothers, E I mean I've never seen two cats so close. C And, F uh, they, F uh, will get to playing chase through the house, C and it is hysterical, E I mean C and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. It's like this train. E I mean it sounds like a train. We have wooden floors C and so it just sort of echoes through the house <laughter>. F Oh no, they're just, they're, they're just, F uh, they're wonderful, F uh. F Uh, we have, F uh, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix. C And what do you have. Oh. Uhhuh, yeah. Nothing. Not a thing, goodness gracious. We have, F uh, F uh, tortoise which is a black and, and orange. C And she's so ugly. Yes, uhhuh. E I mean you can't help but love her. She's, she's the oldest one and, but, F uh, very possessive. E I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma. C And, F uh, E I mean, it comes bedtime C and she's right there. <Talking> Yeah, she's the oldest. C And she, D well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also. C And so yeah, it's, F uh, wouldn't have, E I mean, F oh, if something happens to her. <Noise> It will be. F Oh, goodness. You get so attached to them. My mother has dogs C and I'm like, no. This is nothing like cats. Right, I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked. <Laughter> F Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him. I said, D now you do like cats, right. We don't li, Yes, uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh yeah, F oh, the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying, are you getting rid of your cats, are you getting rid of your cats. You can't be pregnant and have cats. I'm like, F uh, no, no, no. Right, the child will learn to like cats. and deal with them, I'm sorry, we are not getting rid of the cats. The whole family was so disappointed <laughter>. Right. Right, F uh, C but yes, we just, just love them to death. D Well it was nice talking to you too, I enjoyed it. Bye, bye.
