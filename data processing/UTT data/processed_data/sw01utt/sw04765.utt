F Uh, <throat_clearing> a lot of companies now are, are using, F uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, F uh, <sigh> elementary or intermediate or advanced, F uh, drug users. C And, F uh, I know the, the government is, F uh, D you know, gives drug tests an, to all new entrants, all new appli, applicants coming into government. C And, C and I quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with it. I, I'm, I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian. C And, C and I, I feel as though, F uh, that, F uh, F uh, D you know, that if you, you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background. Of course, we're, we're, being involved in my organization, F uh, we, we have deep background checks C and C and so, F uh, C but, C but, sometimes, D you know, drug use can, can escape that. C And, F uh, I have absolutely no compunction about, F uh, using any and all means to, to, F uh, F uh, D you know, work out, figure out who has a drug program E or who has a drug problem and, F uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is to, to, D you know, break this, F uh, activity. Of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs C and there isn't anything C but getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope <laughter>. What's your, F uh, feeling? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well I think, F uh, the dr, the laws on, F uh, F uh, F uh, the first morphine laws were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that. Yeah. D Well, the thing of it is the, the, tha, tha, that, that is, F uh, F uh, in, in many respects, F uh, F uh, D you know, just, just, I think, an over simplification. I, I think there, th, th, th, there's so much criminal activity, F uh, that people go into to, to support drug habits. Yeah. D You know, they, they support drug habits with, F uh, with, F uh, D you know, with things like, F uh, D you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that, yeah. I, I I <static> must admit that, Yeah. Yeah. I, I must admit that the production costs of, of these drugs are, are zippo compared to the street market costs and, and the costs to society, yeah. C But I, I, I, I think that, that the, that, D you know, the, being in law enforcement, D you know, th, th, th, they, I, I probably have a kind of a draconian, Philistine attitude toward it. C And, C but, C but the, F uh, F uh, I, I really feel as though the interdiction effort is, is, as soon as you, you get rid of one goon that's, that's, that's involved in drugs and tha, Yeah, C and then another, another one will jump up. C But we, we see, Yeah. A, a, as soon as we wind up, F uh, F uh, D you know, for, D well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand C but, C but people want to, get, get stoned C and I, I don't see that, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Sure, sure. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, D well I guess I, I guess I'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction. F Uh, D well I guess, mainly because, F uh, it's, I, D well, D like there's two sides to it I guess. F Uh, one is that, F uh, if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug, alcohol, whatever, or, D you know, even if it's smoking, inhibits, D you know, your ability to function, then I, I think that, that, D you know, I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual, D you know, on the spot. F Uh, C but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business. F Uh, C and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that, F uh, things like drug laws seem to come and go. D You know, we had prohibition for awhile C and then we didn't have prohibition. F Uh, D you know, we've had, I guess, laws against, F uh, D you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, I guess. Maybe a little longer. Yeah. D So, ei, eighty years or so. Yeah. F Uh, C so I, D you know, it's, it's hard to, I guess, for me to justify what so, seems like, D you know, basically a breach of the First Amen, D you know, freedom from, F uh, search and seizure, D you know, F uh, on something that may or may not stand as a law, D you know, fifty years from now or even twenty or ten, who knows. E I mean, prohibition certainly didn't last. D Well, C but you got to look at prohibition though. You had the same problems there, right? F Oh, yeah. Sure. D Well it goes back to that, again, if you look at prohibition. E I mean because it's illegal, it costs more. If it was legal, E I mean, face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce. C And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is, D you know, snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real cheap C and, D you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it. C But, yeah, get, F uh, F Oh, yeah, D well that's why there's, D you know, people dealing it because there's money in it, D you know. There's ridiculous amounts of money. <Laughter>. F Oh yeah, interdiction's hopeless. E I mean there's no way you're ever going to win that. The tighter you squeeze, the more the price goes up, the more incentive there is. E I mean that's a losing fight. Yeah, yeah. D Well, yeah. It goes back to, D you know, what right, what can society impose on people. E I mean, can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen? I don't think you can. E I mean, D you know, I'm, D you know, was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic C so, D you know, I'm one of these, D you know, ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people. C So, D you know, yeah, I can really relate to yeah, everybody ought to do their own share, D you know. I don't have any, D you know, love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff. C But, D you know,
