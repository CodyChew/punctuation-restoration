F Uh, invasions of privacy. F Uh, what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things. All, sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing. F Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen just what went into the something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers. I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your, your phone and, and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not. F Um, C but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using C and, F uh, C and, F uh, people, businesses would be prohibited, F uh, from calling for pers, for, for business selling you things. I'm sure that's true. F Uh, some of did too. I think, I think government can do that now, is that right? And, F uh, especially with, with possibly children around. F Uh, that could, could be useful protection. C So, F uh, I used to deal with, What are dialing services? F Oh, F oh, where people just, just call you. C And D you know, C and then what, those problems has been eliminated those problems used to be when I used a credit card they'd want to have my phone number. C And I did not like giving it out. I gave out my work number C but I think I'm not sure if it's by law just, otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number. How did Radio Shack work? Yes, that's, that's, that's one solution C but you, you, you nonetheless often get, get people calling you? Despite the fact that your number is unlisted? C And you actually have your number C or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers. I'll be thinking in mind the address is, F um, is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number? F Huh. Yeah. I don't know. I think it's gotten much worse the last, few years. Maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists. Yeah. Sell you magazines. Uhhuh. I guess whatever is, I just don't give, My T V down. Okay. I'm sorry. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. I hate those <throat_clearing> canned messages they put on my recorder. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I have through, the phone company, F uh, <throat_clearing> no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yes, C and I don't have children around C but I just don't like those nine hundred numbers. C So, I've excluded those. C But isn't, it does not stop you from the, F uh, dialing services. Where they, F uh, intend to sell you things. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And leave again that canned message on the, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, that's the thing I hated too about, F uh, Radio Shack. If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number. C And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning, C and, C and I don't give that out. I have an unlisted number C so I don't, Sure. Uhhuh. D Well, <throat_clearing> anything that you buy F um, you ca, you may get put on the, a, F uh, preferred list that is purchased. C And, C and companies can purchase this list C and what that is is people who buy from the mail. Uhhuh. F Uh, no. Not really. F Um, no. F Uh, some of that unfortunately is legal. C So they can't stop people from, F uh, advertising C and that, C and that's what it falls under. It falls under the guise of advertising. C So, I don't care for it, C but is it a legal, F uh, solution for some companies. C So that, that's the way things are. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, they, D you know, that's, that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy. You've got the holy rollers C and you've got, F uh, all kinds of people knocking on your door and, who want to, F uh, either direct you to the right path or, or want to, F uh, sell you, F uh, paper routes, F uh, whatever, C so, F um, D you know, it's not just the telephone.
