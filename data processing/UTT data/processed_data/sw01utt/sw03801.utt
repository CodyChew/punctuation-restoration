D Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime C or is that a crime free zone there? <Laughter>. I'm afraid you're right. F Oh, my. F Oh, boy. By your house? F Oh, my goodness. F Aye, F aye, F aye <laughter>. F Oh, my. That's, that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening. F Oh, boy. Unfortunately yes. Yes. I think, F uh, D you know, as any city grows up, F uh, you get the hoods and the roof, riffraff and everybody else in there, C and I think, F uh, D you know, fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek, C but, F uh, we've been, we've lived here sixteen years C and now you, D you know, you can tell the change, for sure. Yes. D Well, with all the, F uh, Central Expressway, F uh, with all the stores and the, F uh, restaurants and the F uh, convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by. D You know C and, That's, that couldn't be too far from you, neither. Okay. F Oh, yes, okay. <Squeak>. <Squeak>. <Squeak>. <Squeak>. I don't know, F uh, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody C but, It's kind of, kind of stupid, isn't it. C But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time. It's, looks like easy pickings C and away you go, right. I think you're right, F uh, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too. Right. Right. Right, just like the old alcohol idea C and I think people, F uh, I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money. F Oh, boy. Where do you work? F Uh, yes, I think I do. That, F uh, is that Amelia Earhart, hart School there? Okay. That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it? F Oh, my goodness. F Huh. Definitely that area, that, that's big time. Big time there, sure is. I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself. Gee, that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c, area. No, I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer. F Uh, one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, F oh, D well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams C and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house. C And they had stopped a, F uh, b, a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge C and then the other one was on the roof in the back. B, on my house <laughter>. <Laughter>. C So I'm very much aware of, F uh, crime in the cities and the, and the concern about it. It was. I, F uh, I kept hearing noises C and so I, I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage, C so I got a g, my gun and walked to the, D you know, through the house into the garage. There was no one there, C but I wanted to be sure. <Laughter> Is Plano beginning to experience the, the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, D you know, in the urban area? That's too bad. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano grow from what was really a, a small town to a city. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, F uh, F uh, shooting on the tollway. F Uh, D well, it's farther west of me. I live over near White Rock Lake. C But, F uh, F uh, it was really frightening to, think that, F uh, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth. F Uh, I never thought about someone robbing those, C but, apparently, they do. Yeah, it just doesn't seem possible, does it. Uhhuh. No. Yeah, C and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, F uh, the theft and the, the violence that we see. It, it is convenient, isn't it? I didn't know what I was doing. That kind. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, yes, C and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System. C And, F uh, F uh, F Uh, do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are? F Uh, no this is over near Lincoln High School. F Uh, just, not far off South Central Expressway. It is a pretty rough area. We're over by Fair Park. C And, F uh, D you know, you watch the people. There are marvelous B M W s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns. C And the kids see that C and, F uh, they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where, F uh, D you know, running for, F uh, drug dealers if, Uhhuh. It surely is. <Laughter> D Well, I'm careful. Yeah, it's, F uh, a little scary sometimes C and, F uh, I manage the,
