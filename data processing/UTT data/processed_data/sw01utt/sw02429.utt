D Well, what would you have at a dinner party? Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh, that sounds great. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party. C But if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish. C Because, E I mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish C but D you know, I, I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest. C But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like, F uh, shrimp, shrimp fettucini is real easy to, F um, make and everything C and it's usually well liked by people, I guess, I'm just a seafood fan C so, I think on the lines of, F Oh, yeah, F um, you're not supposed to, E I mean, you're not supposed to eat them dead. E I mean, D well, you eat them dead C but, Right. Because if, if they are dead for too long, you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out. C And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you. Yeah, C so if you ever go in a restaurant, order crawfish, E I mean, every once in a while you'll see on, E I mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident C but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah, don't eat it. C But, F um, you just put some Cajun, D well, lots of pepper <laughter> C and you just boil them C and they're absolutely wonderful C but there's, F uh, they're a pain to peel for some people. Once you get used to it they're real easy C but, <breathing> F um, D you know, if you have nails or anything you can <lipsmack> plan on those being shot. <lipsmack> <breathing> I think for a dinner party I, I don't know it depends. <breathing> D Like if, like my age, if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, I, they would shell their own, D you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something C but, <breathing> F um, if it was more formal like if I was, D you know, working environment then I would probably, F um, <lipsmack> <breathing> sh, shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head <breathing> <laughter>. C But there's a, There's a, <breathing> big thing over here that everybody sucks the head. C So, F um it, it would just depend. That's the best part of the crawfish. <lipsmack> Sucking the head C But F um <lipsmack> I don't know it jus i it just depends on what type it was I guess C But you can buy <breathing> F uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything C And usually you use those D like for frying <breathing> or to put in salads or to F um <lipsmack> D You know make a sauce with or something like that C But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled C and they're more expensive of course C but F Um <lipsmack> Yeah it really does <breathing> I like shrimp better Just F um The crawfish E I mean it just has a taste of its own It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that C but F um I think that C And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps <laughter> That's what I need <laughter> Uhhuh <lipsmack> Oh! <laughter> <laughter> <breathing> I bet that that got pretty competitive D you know as far as <breathing> who could come up with the best recipe <laughter> That would be fun F Uh huh Sometimes it might be the candlelight C and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something <Laughter> <breathing> D Well that's D you know that's fun Uh huh <Laughter>. <laughter> That sounds right I would <breathing> I'd take him up on that <laughter> <laughter> Uh huh <lipsmack> I'd be <laughter> <breathing> I that's about how much I can cook D You know I'm I'm doing a lot more cooking now <lipsmack> than I used to C but that's only because my mom just started working C so <breathing> she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon C so I try to have things cooked for her C but F uh F um I usually try to stay out of kitchen I don't know <laughter> <breathing> not one of my favorite hobbies D Well F um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big gettogether over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce C and it has I don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs C and they are absolutely delicious <breathing> I don't know what she calls them in I don't I'm sure she puts wine in it because F um she cooks everything with alcohol C But <laughter> F um <lipsmack> I don't know I would I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around Oh Yeah Oh that would be wonderful Yeah Umhum Oh Umhum D Well F um how long do you cook the meatballs Uh huh <lipsmack> Oh yeah F Hum That sounds great Especially E I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance E I mean D like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend That would be great <breathing> I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope to <lipsmack> have to have lots of dinner parties <laughter> <breathing> Cause I like to E I mean F um F Um I'm sure that I'll be involved in a big company C and I know that my <breathing> future husband will be D You know He's going to be working for Chevron in Houston C so he's going to be <breathing> F Um <lipsmack> D You know I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy F Oh yeah I have to impress the boss <laughter> <laughter> and clients cause F Um I'm in I'm in public relations in school C so I'm going to have <breathing> D You know my whole job's going to be based on my clients 'n stuff like that C so I'm going to have lots of dinner parties C And have to take 'em out to eat Right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy C and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know E I mean I thought for sure I'd been raised properly C but I've been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about <laughter> C but F um <lipsmack> C So Is there anything else <noise> <laughter> Oh yes you need to try em F Oh they're wonderful. D Well, F uh, lately, since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties <beep>. C but <laughter> when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time <beep>, F uh, I have one recipe for, F uh, a really good, F um, type of a meatball. It's called burgundy meatball C and it's made with red wine and, F um It's, it's really good C and you can make it ahead of time and then, F um, make the sauce when you're ready to, F um, to serve it. That's one of my favorite things to, to serve. Sure. F Oh, really. D Well, I guess being from that part of the country. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, how do, make, how do you, you cook crawfish? I, in fact, I just came back from the grocery store C and being in Texas we don't have too many, D you know, people that, that eat crawfish C but they had live crawfish, on sale. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Don't buy them that way <laughter>. Uhhuh. Okay. D Well, I'll remember that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <breathing> F Huh. When you were, F um, whe, when you <child> serve it do you shell them and then serve em too? Umhum. Sure. <Laughter> Still have see that. <Laughter> Ooh <laughter>. <laughter>. <laughter> Umhum Does it taste a lot like shrimp Uhhuh. Yeah. Sure Yeah. <breathing> We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time C And <laughter> Yeah that's what I wish I had <laughter> <breathing> C but in our family I am the one who who cooks C And I I really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids C But I really do enjoy cooking <breathing> C And we F um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot C And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where <breathing> D you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me C and <laughter> <laughter> we we was really a lot of fun C and Yeah it did we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other C or F Uh it was a lot of fun D you know it something unique D you know C and then we got into different F um themes D you know <breathing> F um whether it would be ethnic food Or F um sometimes it would be F um <click> oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or F uh elegant theme or D you know <laughter> <laughter> It was a lot of fun That's right <laughter> <breathing> it was fun C and C and we threatened to make the other two F uh make us dinner one time F Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking C and they were doing all the enjoying I'm It does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to F uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again <laughter> make hot dogs or some potato chips <laughter> Uhhuh F Oh that's nice <laughter> <breathing> It can it can be fun I if you have the time C But D you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able to Uhhuh <laughter> <laughter> Yeah it's F um it's in the other room I don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs F um an egg F um whatever seasonings you can just light C so salt and pepper F Um and chopped up water chestnuts <child> which is something different F um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop em up real fine C But F um it makes them crunchy C and that adds something new to it <lipsmack> C And then the sauce is just made with F um <breathing> bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and F um cornstarch instead of flour C So it's not a it's not a thick <lipsmack> rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like D you know when you have F um Chinese food That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies C And it gives it a bit of a different consistency <breathing> The meatballs you just F um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're <breathing> F uh browned on all all sides C and then drain off all the grease F Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them C And then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good F oh if they're frozen D you know it may take a half for them to thaw out C But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself Let them simmer in the sauce itself <lipsmack> C and it's real good Right. And then freeze them Sure <laughter> <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah you'll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and friends at work <laughter> Uhhuh. Sure. Oh really <laughter> <laughter> <lipsmack> D Well I I think we've covered the subject I got some interesting information about crawfish I was in fact It's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale F Oh I will I'm sure my husband will be surprised, 'cause we were talking about them the other day mm before
