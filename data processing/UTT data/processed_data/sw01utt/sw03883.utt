Okay. D So how do you just figure, Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. D Well, F um, <lipsmack> I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was <laughter> working at now. F Um, when I was a teacher, F um, in Utah, I would generally wear, F um, dresses and heels and things like that, C and even when it, F um, rained and snowed I just braved it C and I wore heels anyway <laughter>. C And, I know, it might kill you to go up and <laughter>, walk up to the door C but you're going to look nice for the kids <laughter>. F Oh, F oh, yeah. D Well, I need all the height I can get <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, we too. F Um, <lipsmack> if it was real, it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots C but then I would change, F um, into heels, as soon as I got to my desk. C So, F um, Oh. Oh. <Laughter> Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Huh. D Well, F um, Yeah, F um, <lipsmack> the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it <laughter>. C So I did, Yeah, C and then the third year we, F um, got heating C so it was nice <laughter>. Right, uhhuh. F Oh, that's nice. Uhhuh. F Oh. Nice. D Well <laughter>, F Uh, no, we, we moved to Iowa C and, F um, I'm working at a day care right now. C And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months. Yeah, I wear, F uh, tennis shoes, and jeans and things that, D you know, are sort of, F um, not, yes, it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something. Yeah, C but I never wore jeans because, F um, I thought that was too casual <laughter>. For, Yeah, really. <Laughter> Yeah, that's how I feel too. F Um, <lipsmack> F oh, it, there's some good things about it C but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, F um, F Um, we lived in Utah before C and, C and I grew up in California. D Well, D you know, it depends upon our weather here. D You know, today was a beautiful day it was like, F uh, F uh, summer day. It was seventy degrees C so C so I dressed in, F uh, F uh, a light weight skirt, it's a, F uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it. Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews C and so I had to dress up anyway C and then I wore heels, D you know. C But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, F uh, very often, D you know, wear, F uh, pants and boots D you know. D So how do you dress? Okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I can see, I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter C and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that, it was tiring. That's right. That's right C and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right? Yeah, I do too. <laughter> C So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades, F uh, older grades, I had to wear heels. Uhhuh. Of course, we wear, F uh, an unlined boots, D you know, it has a heel on it. They're the kind of boots that I wear to work C and we wear them, D you know, they're a leather boot that you wear C and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel. C And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things. F Uh, it's kind of a, <laughter> I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots. They're not a cowboy boot, C but they're just a real pretty boot, C but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain. As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels D you know, and look like I'm a business <laughter> person. D You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, D you know. Of course, you probably wear coats a lot. F Oh, my goodness C so then you had to. Yes. Then things improved, right? C But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot D you know, D you know, C and, F uh, that's very seldom we, it depends upon our winter. We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, D you know, C but most of the time you can wear a sweater C and we just don't wear coats much. We often laugh about even when it turns chilly. We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that. It's really different. <laughter> Let's put it that way. Are you not teaching anymore? I see. F Oh, C so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet. Yeah, uhhuh. More practical. When you were teaching, did you ever have, F uh, F uh, a blue jean day or anything like that? Yeah, D well, I know that some of the schools they have, F uh, country western day or something like that one, D you know, or tacky day, C and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real <laughter> tacky too. It's all right for the students, they look tacky a lot C but I didn't think teachers should, D you know. Yeah. Do you like, F uh, F uh, Iowa? Where did you live before? F Oh, D well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,
