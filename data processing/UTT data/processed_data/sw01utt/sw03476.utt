For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I suppose so. Let me push the button. <Beep> Okay, F uh, I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system, C but, F uh, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon. Uhhuh. You're now in what? Acoustics, F uh. D Well, I guess that is the policy, C but it's been the policy for a long time C and nothing ever happens. F Uh, I suppose things, some things D well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation come up that's more used to it. They have to for international trade. C But, I g, guess it's, it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, F uh, be, be, because of, of, F uh, of computers coming into everything. Everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind. F Uh, I, I, I don't see that, it, it, it can change it very quickly. E I mean we're not the kind of society that, that, F uh, that something can be posed upon, F uh, by government will. F Uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, F uh, money, dollar, coins, anything like that. C And, C and, C and it <breathing>, it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in, in using the old system. D Well, E I mean, unfortunate, I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. <Lipsmack> F Uh, E I mean, there are things you could do. F Uh, we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twentyfive miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour. F Uh, C but that hasn't been adopted very widely. <Laughter>. <Lipsmack> C But, E I mean, C and no one will, will go a step further to remove the english signs. F Uh, yeah, C or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, F uh, eighty, eightyfive, whatever would be the appropriate number. Hundred car is going sixtytwo, yeah, D so it would be more like, F uh, like ninety I guess, car is going fiftyfive. F Uh, you suddenly have a <laughter> have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now. Do, do, do you know, where you are, do the schools emphasize the metric system? No, E I, I, I meant, E I meant down, like, in the elementary schools. E I mean, I think, Yeah, E I mean, I think my children learned the metric system, C but it doesn't get, get emphasized over the other. F Oh, okay, C so it's right up your alley, then. All right. Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen either, C but I wish it were C because I'm a, I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering. I'm at grad school now in acoustics C and all we do is metric stuff. Acoustics. Yeah, C so everything's metric C and then you go to read some order book or something C and it's all confusing C so I don't understand as much, C so I think we should get one adopted permanently. Yeah, a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. I think people need to understand more D like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms. C Because someone says a kilogram, no one knows what that is. Yeah. Yeah, no one seems to be adopting it. Metric system, no one's very, F uh, no one wants it at all seems like. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, I, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused, though. I think two systems is worse than one, though <laughter>. C Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things C and they're half english and half metric C and <noise> you, you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems. just get one. I prefer metric, C but even if it's english, they should just have one. <Laughter> Yeah <laughter>, yeah, I think so. Your, your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination. Yeah. Yeah, they have some of those in Ohio. There's this one sign's kind of funny. It says, F uh, metric signs next hundred miles. <Laughter>. Yeah, that would force everybody to use it. Or to quit selling tape measures in inches. Yeah, I guess a hundred is sixtytwo. Yeah, you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety <laughter>. Yeah, in the engineering they all do pretty much. F Oh, in the elementary schools. I don't know. I wouldn't think so. I remember a ways back we did like conversions, C but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system. Yeah, they learn how many centimeters are in an inch C and that's about it.
