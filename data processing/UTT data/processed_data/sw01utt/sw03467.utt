I said Arlington, Texas because the other day, I was talking with somebody C and he was in Arlington, Virginia <laughter>. Yeah, that's the only one I've got now for this area. D Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject. You go ahead first, if you'd like. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, D you know you get so busy. F Oh, <laughter>. I know. Right. Are they little? Yeah, they're pretty young. I don't know, my kids are older C so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I used to <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. D Well I, I like the comedies. They're just light, too. I have to watch MURPHY BROWN I really like, I make a point of that. I love that C and I really like COACH. I think it's, when it's good, it's just a scream. D Well, he's probably playing himself. Half the time you see these people on an interview show, they're, they act just like they do in their parts <laughter>. He, I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once C and he acted about the same <laughter>. Yeah, C and, F uh, D Well, I watch more now because, D well I, I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy C but this semester I'm only taking one course C and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS. I just make a point of seeing those. F Oh, it's fabulous. Really, you should never miss that. It, they are just gems of shows. E I mean, they really, fabulous in every way <laughter>. F Oh, that's Wednesday at, F uh, seven thirty. F Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, D well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime. Just so you get the idea. It wouldn't take, Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those <laughter>. D So, D so, I watch those. D Well, D you know, I haven't, F oh, yeah, we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE. D Well, it's not really new, C but it's still kind of new. I like it a lot. It's real different. In fact, they never thought it would be a hit. E I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost, D you know, like supernatural, or something, D you know, E I mean, somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does C or, E I mean, it sounds weird, C but, it's very, F uh, unique show and very well done. Excellent actors. I, I guess we just, it came on after something we used to watch C and I guess we just kept sitting there C and then now we make a point of watching <laughter>. I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television. D Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess <laughter>. C And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays. C But, F uh, Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that. Was she the, was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show? Really? Right, right. Yeah, they had a big fight on that show, didn't they? They were all accusing each other of everything in the world <laughter>. D Well, I know, F gosh, you never will, probably. D Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable. I don't have cable. It's just as wild as any soap opera, from what I hear on the news. C And I think he's guilty as the devil. I know, what's in it for her. There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich high powered lawyers. F Um. I know, everybody was saying that C and then, in the paper said it C so, It should be interesting. D Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says <laughter>. I was reading that in the supermarket line. I never have the nerve to buy the thing. F Uh, Says he, No, I don't care anything about that. I like the ice skating, D you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics I always watch that. I think it's so beautiful. F Oh, yeah, that's good. F Oh, no. F Oh, F gosh, F oh, F gosh. Yes, we do. Okay, let me think here. Favorite, I haven't been watching much T V lately <laughter>. I used to. Yeah, I have, F uh, I have one favorite soap opera.
