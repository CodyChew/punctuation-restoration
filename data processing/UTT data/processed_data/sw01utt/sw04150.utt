All right? Okay. How many kids do you have? <laughter>. Right. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. No. Yeah, we, we've been married for two and a half years. We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet. Hopefully, Uhhuh. Had, <<Speaker whispers to someone in the background>> She had another call. <<pause>> She has just three kids, eleven, nine, and eight. Uhhuh. All right. <Laughter> Okay. That keeps you bu, do you have a lot of activities with your kids? <Groan>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. C So they're pretty good kids, huh? Yeah. D Well, we had ni, wh, growing up I guess I can talk about us. We had nine kids in our family. We had eight boys and one girl. C But, my Dad, F uh, Yeah. C And the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own business C so we worked with him most of the time. C So that's how we spent most of the time with him. Yeah. <Laughter> That was a dead giveaway, huh? Uhhuh. Oh. Which that, <Laughter>. I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much. Yeah, that's <laughter>. C But, Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Wel, Yeah. It's like you said, D you know, to each his own. C And we're planning on having my wife stay home. C And C but, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's good. Sounds like you're, have a handle on it. <Laughter>. F Um, no, not right now. Right. D Well, we just moved down here. We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years. It's <laughter> that's no problem here. <laughter> Yeah, we really liked it up there C but then wh, Yes. <Laughter> I think w, I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children. We, have three children who are eleven, nine, and eight. <lipsmack> C So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about C but <laughter>, perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time C and, Anyway. You don't have children? C But you're married? Oh. D You know, I know we're not supposed to do this long distance C but D actually I'm getting a call. I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting. Could I ask you to hold one minute? I'll be right back. Excuse me, just a moment. They're going to get mad <beep>. Hello? I'm so sorry. That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting. <Gasp>. D Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral <laughter> conversation C but, <gasp> yes, we do. Both my husband and I work C and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade. C And the school years are wonderful, they're just wonderful. The kids, they are real people C and they are interesting C and, they, they have all their own activities C and, F um, I think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel <laughter>. I'm su, sure that's coming though. C But, they are wonderful kids. You had eight boys and one girl? Are you Mormons? That's what the Utah and the large family. D Well, we're Catholics. I came from a family of five. I had four brothers, the only girl. C And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled. I never felt spoiled. In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed <laughter>. No. Usually busy fighting for survival. D Well, I do think with working parents it is, E I mean, there are some real issues here. F Um, that I think, F um, I don't know. It's an interesting <laughter> problem. I happen to, F um, <lip_smack> I'm a pediatrician. My husband is a physician, C so, F uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot. C But children, I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, F um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt, that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family. C And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. C And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home. I really believe that. C And it has, F um, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age, C and I think our kids are real secure. And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot C so I know it sounds like a rationalization C but it's, I really think it's true for our family, C and I think it has worked very well. There's no question, I think that's really the best. If, if a woman is happy doing that, I hate to put it quite that way. I was twentynine when I had my first child C and, F uh, I would not have been real fulfilled. I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child. It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother C but, <lipsmack> F uh, I like th, I like the way I did it. <Laughter> I sort of worked half time. I had very flexible hours. <lipsmack> I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year C and I, you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers. F Um, C and I think we choose very, very carefully the, F um, alternative situations that we had them in. Some babysitting groups, again, I know it sounds like a rationalization, C but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children C and they, they learn to share. They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure. <Lipsmack> I think that helps. D Well, D so, D so. D So, your wife, does she work right now? She's out, You're still trying to dry out?
