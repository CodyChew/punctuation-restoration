Okay, D so which, F uh, what basketball teams are you interested in? Uhhuh. Uhhuh No, they're more of a football team than they are basketball team. Yeah. D You know, that's true. I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball. Uhhuh. F Huh. F Um. That's not too bad. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, I'm, F uh, originally from the Saint Louis area, C so the only basketball team, pro anyway, in that part of the country is Chicago. C So, I, I do pull for Chicago. E I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a, a Chicago B, fan, I guess, because they're doing pretty good. Yeah, yeah. F Um, as far as college teams, F uh, I know it's really easy to say, C but I've been pulling for, F uh, Duke for about four years now C so, F uh, C so, I finally am feeling better about <laughter> myself as far as college teams. Although, I've, I've really, D you know, again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri. F Uh, C but they're on, F uh, probation this year C so you can't do much about that. C But, F uh, F Oh, yeah. I watched every, F uh, I watched all three games of that. C And, F uh, I was very pleased with all three games, because Kansas, F uh, D you know, I was pulling for Kansas on the other side, C so it was real nice to have the, the teams that were there. Of course, I wasn't really, E I mean, I, I, U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a, F uh, F uh, A oh, I don't know, a macho team, D you know, they just didn't seem, they seemed to think they were better than everybody else C and, C and maybe they were, C but, F um, I was real happy to see them get knocked off. C So, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. U N L V, yeah, they, they play the pro style, is, what I've always called it. C And, F uh, yeah, the fast breaks and, and, Right. C And, F uh, U N L V wasn't used to that. Of course, I've, I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time, D see I don't know if they were necessarily behind, C but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are. F Uh, C and, D you know, that meant that they had to play a second half C and they, they've not had to do that all year C and, F uh, That's right. E I mean Duke's schedule was, was so much harder than U N L V's that it, F uh, it just made them a much tougher team overall, C and, F uh, that had to help them a lot. Uhhuh. D So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, F uh, will win C or, E I mean, Portland's pretty good. F Um, Yeah. Yeah. No. D Well, he's, F uh, I don't, I, he, he to me is not a center, he's more of a, a real tall forward <laughter>. F Uh, I think Magic does a, F Oh, yeah. That sure is. It, I think that's going to be one of those that's, F uh, that's won by the home team, D you know, whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think. Detroit's in that same, F uh, that, that same, F uh, division. No, C but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week. C So, F uh, that might help them. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. That's true. Uhhuh. He's, yeah C but he's been, yeah, C but he's been kind of up and down all year. F uh, one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in C and then the next time he'll, D you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn. C So, I don't know, I'm, I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year. Uhhuh. D Well that's when, you do it. Yeah. D Well, the dark horses, Yeah that's, Yeah. D Well, anybody who has David Robinson, has got to have a chance anyway. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. F Huh. <Laughter> That's true. Yeah. D Well then, he's gone now C so, they don't have to worry about that. D Well, I thought he was gone period. I, I didn't read the story, C but I, I, read that, F uh, D Well, that might have been what it was, C but I, I guess the headlines said something about him, D you know, that the Mavericks released him or something, I, maybe I misunderstood what they meant. D Well, yeah you never know. Yeah C but, Yeah. <Laughter> That's what I think. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. It's coming up, isn't it. Portland. Yeah, Portland. Uhhuh. They've got two, the two Johnson brothers C or they're not brothers, C but I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something, I forget how that works. C But, F um, like I said they're doing extremely good right now. Phoenix isn't doing too bad. C So, It, it ought to be a real interesting playoff. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. When it's on the line. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. D Well, it's been nice talking to you. All right. Take care. D Well, I guess I'm a big Laker, L A Laker fan, when it comes to pros. F Uh, the college ranks, F um, I guess I really, of course I try to follow my alma mater, that's, F uh, B Y U, in Utah. C But they don't have much of a team usually. Yeah, yeah. You see them in football on T V once in awhile. You never see them on a, on nationally basketball. They, F uh, last year they had a really good team, the year that Danny Aines was there. That was about five, six years ago by now. C So, they made it to the <noise> sweet sixteen, once or twice, in their history, C and that's, C and they usually lose in the first round. <laughter>. How about you? Uhhuh. Is it the Bulls you're talking about? Yeah, the pro, Is that right? Uhhuh. No, no. D So, did you watch the, F uh, final four this year? Every game? Right, right. Yeah. I, I watched that game. C and, F uh, it was a good game. It was a very close game, and hard fought game. C And it just, I don't know, it looked like U N L V may have had more, F uh, talent, C but, as far as playing together as a team that day, it didn't, Duke seemed to have them off balance. C And that, F uh, they didn't, couldn't, aren't they more of a running gun team? Right. Yeah, fast breaks and things and, They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed C and, Right. <Noise> Right, right. They didn't have, they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year C and that, C and that, C so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that, right in, when it, when it counts so much. Right. I think, I think that, that probably was the difference in that game. C Because it really could have gone an, either way. Down to the end, D you know. D Well, <Noise> <<pause>> I don't know. Probably not. Since Kareem's retired, they haven't had a center. C And, F uh, they've got Perkins, C but I don't think he's really been a super star for them. Yeah. Right, right. D So, They'll make it, D you know, i, i, it, it's going to be a war between, F uh, between Chicago and, F uh, and, F uh, F uh, Boston Celtics. That's going to be a war. It's going to be a great series. Yeah. One of those two will probably be, F um, in there, F um, let me see, where does Detroit fit in? Uhhuh. C So, I don't know, those three, F uh, Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year. Uhhuh. Yeah. They have the, they have the playoff experience, C but, C so does Detroit, E I mean, C so does Chicago. D So do, all three of them do, with Larry Bird back, F uh, you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's, starting to click on all cylinders. They say he's starting to do, starting to play, Right. Right. Right. Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now. He's, starting to be more consistent, D you know, right at the right time of the year. F Oh, any dark horses I, F uh, D you know, San Antonio, San Antonio is the dark horse that could, could really flip in there, I think. Yeah. He's got to be pretty much, D you know, I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player, D you know, when he, against any team he would dominate, C but Robinson's getting up there where, every game, he's just, E I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk C and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, D you know, nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's, when he's driving hard to the hoop. He's, F uh, he's, too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him. With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble. Yeah, for awhile anyway. I heard he was suspended. Because of his, F Um. If they did, they'd still have to pay his contract <laughter>. They may have done it. It was a lot of money. He was making D like, I heard on the radio it was sixtythree thousand and change a month. That's what he was being paid, D you know, he wasn't even playing. F Oh, boy, what a good job he had <laughter>. He ruined his sweet position <laughter>. Yeah. I'm looking forward to the, the pro playoff, F uh, L A, yeah, San Antonio, who's the other one that's doing so well this year, Port, is that Portland? Portland. I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all, C but all I can do is hear about, boy they have the seeing eye. What do they have Walter Davis and, F Um. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think there's any clear pick, D you know. I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird, and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson. They are two guys that seem to find a way when they, When it's on the line, they seem to find a way. D You know, F uh, C so, those are what makes a champion I guess. Yeah. Nice talking to you. Take care. Bye.
