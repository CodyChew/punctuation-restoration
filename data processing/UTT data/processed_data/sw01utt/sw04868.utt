Budgeting activity in our household I, has is, F uh, F uh, kind of an informal kind of situation. We, we, D you know, put, actually what happens is, F uh, is, my check gets automatically deposited. I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore. It just gets deposited. C And, <Laughter> C and, C and my, my wife, D you know, D you know, looks at all those bills that come in C and, D you know, C and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. D You see, C and so our, our budgeting, w, we really don't have a formal budgeting situation. Every time I've ever tried one, it's, F uh, I've just got wrapped in my inertia. C And, F uh, I've just decided not to pursue it. F Uh, what, what's your budget situation? D You know, D well a, a, actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it? Uhhuh. D Well, my, D you know, my, my parents too. You, you you were born in, in the, in the late thirties or early forties. Yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. D Well, that, that's good. <Noise> D Well, we, we buy what, D well, we just got through buying a twentyfive foot refrigerator, a new ceramic top stove, and a new dishwasher. C And, C and we put twentyeight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was, was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars F and D you know. Right. E I mean, we just, we got a monster, D you know, bill coming in. C But, C but we also have zero in, interest being paid. C And we pay it off as, as it goes. Yeah. C So we never really get that much over, F uh, over extended. F Huh. Yeah. We're, we're doing that. We have, D you know, F uh, th, this is our, our, our big, F uh, we did redecorating. Two, D you know, two new pieces in the ref, in the family room and new carpet. E I mean we just F uh, we've just been spending, spending, spending. C Bu, C but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've, we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year. D So we're, D you know, we don't have that. Yeah, it's, F uh, it's about time that we did that. C But, th, the, the terrible part about it. I've looked at it all C and it all looks still pretty good to me. Why, why <laughter> we need to replace it? C But, C but, <laughter> un, unfortunately my, my, my wife really <<mispronounced>> feels as though it's, it's just been an inappropriate, F uh, thing to, to, E I mean that rug is thirteen years old, why not replace it. E I mean, F uh, I say it might go for another thirteen C but, F uh, too late, we'll never find that out. C And, <Sneezing>. D You know, I, I, <noise> I don't spend that much money. I just, F uh, we just sort of have had, F uh, D you know, too many obligations to, D you know, we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they, they got through school. C And that was the major, D you know, decade of expenses, D you know. C So we, we feel as, F uh, C but as far as any formal budgeting, F uh, D you know, I, I, we just apparently have been very fortunate. When we went, want to go out to eat, we go out to eat. We never really, <pounding> D you know, have to program money for that or make choices, D you know. C But, F uh, we don't have that uproarious a, a lifestyle. After all, we're, <Laughter>. D Well, actually, F uh, I've, I've had a couple of different situations. My current one has been the most successful. F Uh, at a certain point in life C an, my husband, my exhusband was an alcoholic. C And we got divorced back in the midseventies C and that left me with three teenagers. <Laughter> It certainly is <laughter>. C But at any rate, what happened was that I, I just absolutely put away all the credit cards. I didn't rip them up. I didn't send them back. Nothing. I just put them away. C Because there was one that it was really handy to have. If I absolutely had to have something, I could go use it. C But, F uh, mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had. C And if we didn't have it, we absolutely didn't spend it. C But then, as things improved, D you know. Once, once I got them all through college, F uh, it came to the point where, F uh, my parents came through the depression. I'm not sure how old you are. C But my, Late thirties, yeah. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house. C And that's kind of the way I was raised. C And so I'm not a very demanding person in, in that aspect. D So for quite a period of time, I just flat didn't spend any money. D Now, meanwhile, I got, had a, a building bank balance. C And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have, I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest. C And that, that's the way I've operated ever since then. It, C and D you know, if, if something goes on sale and I don't have the money, I still don't buy it. F Oh my <laughter>. F Oh my! F Oh my. Uhhuh. C And that's the way I do my credit cards now. Yeah. I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. C But it's the fact that I have enough of a, of a cushion in the bank so that when they come, I can pay them in full. F Oh my. <Laughter> I'm envious <laughter>. D Well I, Uhhuh. It's time for you to do these things then. Right? <Laughter>. <Laughter> This is so funny. That's wonderful. C But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money, you need somebody to help you spend it. E I mean, certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should, be or not <laughter>.
