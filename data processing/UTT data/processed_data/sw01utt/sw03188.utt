D So have you done any painting projects lately? <Laughter>. F Oh, really? What kind of painting was it? Uhhuh, it, was it? Yeah, F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, D well, what kind of paint did you use for the, F um, bookends? Uhhuh. D So you can't use oil on wood? F Oh, <laughter> D so you had to go around with paint all over you, temporarily, anyway. F Oh, <laughter>. F Oh, is, is that what you usually use in the house, is latex? F Um. <Inhaling> Uhhuh, yeah, I heard about that. I guess a friend of mine had a, F uh, D well, she, she just started up a day care center, C and F uh, the, one of the real strict, F uh, restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff C so, F uh, she had that done. C But, F uh, D Well, F um, so to speak, I had to paint this, F uh, the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some, F um, farm equipment in C and, F um, what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer, C and, F uh, I had this big five gallon jug, C and it was like paint thinner. E I mean I, D you know, it looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner C but, F uh, you just took a roller and put it on there, C and, F uh, if you saw that the wood was getting wet, D you know, that was, that was all you needed. C So. Yeah, it was, it used all of it. I guess it was about three hundred yards worth. C So. D Well, I guess it worked out. It was pretty easy, actually. <Laughter>. D Well what about the trim in your house? Did you have to do that? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, Did you have, F uh, one coat or two? Uhhuh. Yeah, that would be really time, F uh, a time saver. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, me, I would have had to have taped the whole thing, and then brushed around the edges, C and, C and then I'd have probably rolled it on. I'd, it would have taken me forever. Yeah, D well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever, C so <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, how long did it take you all? Uhhuh. C So there was two of you all? <Laughter> D Well, that's easy enough. F Um. I think I could probably do it F uh, as long as the hardware store told me what to buy, then I could do it. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, this is a great topic for me, because I just did my first two painting projects ever. Was not, not a big deal two little deals, The first one, F um, I helped someone repaint an apartment, C and it was very easy. Yeah, C and I've never painted anyth, I always thought it would be, C so, D you know, you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something C but I know I can do it. C And the second one was I bought some toys at a, F um, at a craft fair. They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas, C and so I decided to paint them, C and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment <laughter>. D Well, it's, F uh, it, that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't, it was a oil base, C so I had to get, C and when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house. C So I had it, had it all over my hands. At first I didn't realize, D you know, I had never painted anything, C so I didn't realize that I needed that. E I mean, I kind of knew, in the back of my mind, D Well, no, you can use it on wood, C but I just had it all over my hands, C and I went to wash the brushes out, and, F uh, wash my hands, C and you can't wash it off with water. You have to get the, F uh, a solution C and, Yeah, I had to drive to the store yeah, I had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner, and and everything like that, C and then, F um, downstairs in the apartment, I just us, we just used a latex base, C and so you can drip it on, D you know if you dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real easy to clean. Yeah, C and, C and it, it just like the same with the toys, it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it, D you know, it says Safe for Children, and all that. Yeah. Have you painted anything recently. Wow, was it huge? Uhhuh. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I think though, F um, we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work, because I don't know if I could, D you know, I don't know, I don't know, must be difficult, No, it was j, it was really easy, I just, D like, what, we had a couple of different size brushes D you know, real easy, I went around the trim, C and if it, C and there was wall paper, D like I was do, just doing just the trim outs that, around the doors and windows C and there was wall paper C and <Throat_clearing> if we got it on the wall paper a little bit, we just wipe it right away before it dried, it came right off C so there was no major mistakes, there was, F Uh, two, actually F um, C and it, there was, F um, D you know, around the windows, if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after that C but that, D Well, yeah, if you just, D you know we didn't tape anything, we weren't that careful, C but it wasn't, D you know, I don't know, it's, it's funny, it's like, if you just go slow, you don't get, E or at least I didn't get that many mistakes I didn't make that many mistakes, Why? Just because you'd be afraid to do it, or have you done it before. <Laughter> D Well, it wasn't, if it was my own I would have, C but my friend said, F oh just go ahead, you just go ahead, it's easy. I said, Okay, it's your place, D Well, a couple of week ends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends, C and, No, there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs, C and there was, I was just painting because I don't know how to do anything else <laughter>. C So, there's a whole bunch of people. C So now I feel like if I ever buy a house, I can probably paint, if nothing else. Yeah. C But D you know, I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys, C and the guy said, F Oh, get this, it's a nice shiny gloss, which was true, C but I didn't realize what, D you know, pain it is to clean the brushes and everything, if you don't have latex I don't if it's worth the shine,
