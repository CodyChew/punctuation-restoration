D Well, have you seen a new movie lately? Uhhuh. Okay. I, F uh, I haven't seen either one of those. F Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though? D Well, maybe you, F uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES. Okay. What did you think of that one? <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, F uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June, C and that's when the movie was filmed, C and, F uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went, F uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre C and it was filmed right outside of Pierre. In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene. F Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm, C and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo C and, C and, F uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all a, looked at the buffalo, it was really neat. C But, F uh, C so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre C and, F uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, D you know C or, D you know, they'd start recognizing people. Yeah. D So, <laughter> I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, F uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that. I'd go D now, D now which one could that be D you know, C and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall, Right. Exactly. C So, C but I, I thought it was a good film. C But you are right, I think, I think it was very one sided. Sure. Right. <Throat_clearing> In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night C and, it was a similar, F uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort. F Um, C but it was an interesting movie. F Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN? D Now I thought that was a good show. Yeah. It didn't, F uh, it didn't have any real social bearing C or, F uh, C and it wasn't really a comedy, C but it was an enjoyable movie. It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS s, series, D you know, just something a little different, yet believable. F Uh, D now are you, are you going to see, E or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan, are you going to see this next one that's coming out? Have you seen the rest? I think I've missed one. I'm not sure, C but I think I've missed one. Was that here in Dallas? Okay. C Because we had one here in Dallas. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I am a student C and I have, F uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than being able to go out to see, F uh, movies at the store, E or at the theater. F Uh, I st, I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, F uh, catch ROBIN HOOD. F Uh, let's see. F Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on. F Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, F um, recently. D Well, you're catching me at, it, F uh, F uh, at minds end here. What have you <laughter> seen recently? <laughter>. Yes. Yes. Enjoyed that quite a bit. F Um, I thought the, F uh, the cima, the cinematography was excellent. F Uh, the story was, F uh, though it tended to be a little one sided F uh, it was good. F Uh, it was, it was believable. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. They knew, they knew the extras or the, Uhhuh. Scope. Uhhuh. It, it was, C but it's a side that hasn't been told. F Uh, as far as, D you know, telling it from, D you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys. I, I really thought about, F uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years, C and it's just, shoot the Indians, C and they are always the savages. D So, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yes. Yeah. That was, that was a good movie. F Um, it was just kind of a get away movie. Kind of, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Yes. You're bringing it, I don't know, I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen. <laughter> C But, yeah, I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES, C and, F uh, F Oh, definitely. Yes. I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago, C and they showed all five in a row. F Oh, they had it everywhere, F uh, every major city had one theater that did it C and, Right, C and they did it in Houston, they did it, D well, they did it everywhere. C And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed, C and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, F uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them, C but you can watch the characters develop,
