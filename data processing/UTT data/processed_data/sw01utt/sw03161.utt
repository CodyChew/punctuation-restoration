The AIDS issue is, is a bit of a problem. I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem, is, is the financial end. C And how can a country stand to, F uh, spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem, F uh, C but, then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the, the knowledge, or at least the, the rumor, A I'm not really sure if it's true or not, that, F uh, we're not spending as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer. F Uh, there's some, F uh, take breast cancer, for instance. It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe, many more people than AIDS. C And yet, F uh, more people die of it, C and yet the funding has already, F uh, exceeded, AIDS has more money than, F uh, breast cancer <breathing> <whistling>. D So, F uh, E I mean, if it's true. I, I've, I've always heard these things. I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure, C but, F uh, I've heard it on more than one documentary that, F uh, they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and, F uh, it's just one big P R campaign that, yeah, we think that's the world's worst thing C so let's give money to AIDS. C And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years. C And, it's just one of those, F uh, course, one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going to get funded. C And, F uh, having thought about that for a while, <Breathing> D Well, I, I kind of, I thought, D well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing. C But then I got, I got to thinking, the, the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate C and there's only one test that just recently got developed, F uh, a blood in, antigen, F uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood C and that's fairly recent. C And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years. C So it's not really cured, yeah, it's not, F uh, not that heavily funded either C and then that seems to be one of the, the major, F uh, problems that men have in the realm of cancer, C so, I don't know. I, I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. F Uh, be it through different organizations, March of Dimes type, F uh, telethons or, or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, F uh, illness they wish. It's kind of hard to, to get an even keel on that. E I mean, it's really hard to say, D well, there's, D you know, a hundred thousand per year affected by this one C so let's give it this amount, C and then this other one's only a tenth of that, C so give it a tenth of that and, and just keep <breathing> doling it out that way C or, Right. Right. That's true. D You know the, the other thought that I had, F uh, I've had several minutes to think about this after I, F uh, while I was finding people, I, F uh, I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it, C so it's kind of a, a < typo as it were, C but, the other thing that I thought of on this is, I wonder if there isn't enough money, F uh, in our economy or in our system. F Uh, it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good. E I mean, yeah, they're kind of nice. C But, we have such an affluent a, society, society that I wonder if, if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a, a cure for just about everything. Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people, C but that's <laughter>, Yeah. D You know, you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza C or you hear these, these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this, that or the other C and then you have all the arts that, that are nice and aesthetic, C but are they that enhancing for the, for the masses, D you know. They certainly do well for those who go to the <breathing> symphony orchestra and all that, C but, F uh, had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else, Than, D well, that's interesting, isn't it, yeah. Right. <Laughter> What did you think about that idea? They've not really given it attention either, yeah. Right. D Well, I'm, I'm glad I'm not the one that's, that's in charge of, of making those decisions. They, F uh, you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious, D you know. E I mean it's not so serious, I guess, until it affects your family C and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing. <Lipsmack> C So I, I would hate to have that <breathing> responsibility just personally C but, C but then, again, we really, we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address <breathing>. I, F uh, I guess I, it, it frightens me to think <breathing> of so many people with, with AIDS and with cancer C and many of those things, F uh, if they're not able to, to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other. Whether it's through prevention or, or <breathing> treatment or, D you know, <<pause>> just, F uh, just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves. It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it. C But <<very faint>>, <Laughter>. Just change our p, Right, just change our priorities a little bit. Right.
