Okay, have you painted something lately? Yeah. F Oh yeah, another bedroom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh yeah <laughter>. F Oh heavens. D Well, I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom. C But I get, I have that problem with the the ceiling, D you know, the, F uh, the blown, blown, ceiling. D You know where you get around the edge. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, how do you get the edge though? The the straight edge? F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. D Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too? F Oh really? F Oh nice. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, that will be nice. F Huh. Or, two tone, or two tone. D You know. Uhhuh. White. C But, I have a problem. I can't get up high C and we can't paint the chimney <laughter>. We have one of those ladders. We are just not willing to get up that high. <Laughter>. D Well, we did too. We did it in the fall C and it, it's just too high. It is really scary, C but C and the only thing I would consider doing, a professional, maybe doing that, C but it other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. The blowers? F Oh, F oh, F oh, F oh, I know what you are talking about. F Uh scaffold. That's it <laughter>. F Huh. Its, Yeah. F Oh, my. C So that was worth it getting a professional for that. <Laughter> F Oh, I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney, C but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself. It wasn't too bad. E I mean you think, Shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty. Since, it is a one story, C but we did, F uh, D like two heavy coats over it. C But then that way D you know you are assured you did a good job than you are, D you know, if you hire someone to do it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. My word. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. C So that was really worth it. Painting his own house. F Oh, my word <laughter>. F Oh, my word. D Well, he really saved in that way. <Laughter> C But, yeah, I think we are going to do, F uh, another bathroom, C but I think I will probably just do it, in a roller. I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little, F Oh, I know. C But it's that, it's the textured wall. Yes, I have. That room I showed you. C And then since then we have painted the bedroom. Yeah, I showed you that one too didn't I? The brown one. Yeah, the one that looks like a fudgesicle. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh yeah. D Well, that is hard. D Now, I asked Janice, or somebody recently how you do that F uh, when you paint the ceilings D you know where you have got that textured stuff, that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with. How do you get the edge? You just have to be real careful. We use, F uh, F uh, a two inch brush with, F uh, on a slant C and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes. C But. D Well, yeah. I think I am going to do it this spring actually. Yeah, there are six houses. D See the people that own the house they, F uh, pay for anything like that, that we do. As far as the the materials. There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses. C So, I am thinking I am going to change it to, F uh, something, D you know, the brick is multi color. Mostly earth tones. I think I am going to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. And maybe, a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little. What color did you paint, Yeah. There are some columns that could be painted a different color too. What color did you paint your house? On the out, D Well, you have got to get one of those ladders. F Oh, yeah. A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood, he has done his house C and that is what he, I was out there last week C and he has finished everything except the chimney. Yeah. D Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco, C but we had all this trim to paint, and lots of it. C And we did basically seventyfive percent of the house C and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff. C So, I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid. C And he came with, with his own raf, what do you call those things? No, those where you built D like a rafter thing. Yeah. Scaffold. He came and did it that way C and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up. C And literally I wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus C and if he fell, he was dead C and he knew that <laughter>. C So, Yeah. C Plus, he cleaned up my mess. Uhhuh. How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside? Yeah. Yeah. C But, that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to, F uh, I guess to buy his paint C and yet he bought D like seventeen gallons. C And, anyway, he, when he checked out A and he was using his charge card too. They only charged him for one gallon of paint. D Like thirteen bucks or something. C And he had, he had, the, F uh, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that C and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint C so she had to start all over again C and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was D like thirteen ninetynine or something. C And he saw. Yeah, it was D like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. F Uh. Rollers are so messy. We never any more. D Well, a little paintbrush,
