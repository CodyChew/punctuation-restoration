Do yo, are you on a reg, regular exercise program right now? <Laughter>. F Oh, D well, I'm kind of off and on. Right now I'm kind of off. Okay, what type of exercise do you do? Okay. I guess you don't enjoy that very much. Do you find that, F uh, to be boring? Yeah. D Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring. C But I, Yeah, I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not I just bought myself a solo flex machine, I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V. It's one of those, F uh, universal type machines, exercise machines. C But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet, C so it's collecting dust right now. I used to jog somewhat. Uhhuh, D well, that's good. Yeah, my parents have a treadmill it's, when I go visit them, F uh, I get on that thing every now and then. Uhhuh, I just got the bicycle out today, C and it was real nice outside, had to get out to do something. I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold C so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day. C But, F uh, yeah, I need to start jog something again. I've always of that to be, F uh, really one of the best forms of exercise, C but it's terribly boring, C and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently. No, I never have. D Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries I usually only go about a mile or two. Yeah, it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt. Suppose to be much better if you find grass, F uh, or, or dirt to jog on. You have to have the right, type of shoes too, that's, very important. C But, Yeah, I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much use <laughter>. Uhhuh. I usually enjoy the exercise I do C but, F uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program. C So I'll, I'll bicycle I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, F uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile, C but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week. C But, F uh, that gets old too in a very short order, I'm, I'm hoping that this, F uh, solo flex will, F uh, F uh, change things a little bit, I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis. Yeah. Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, F uh, start some type of, F uh, regular program. I've always found that, F uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, F uh, keep something going. F Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, F uh, taking, F uh, physical education courses on exercise, C an, F uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, F uh, working out like that. C And that was very helpful we kept charts of our progress, and, F uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks. I found that to be, F uh, very helpful. F Uh, I need to, I haven't started yet C but, F uh, <laughter> it's a thought. Sounds like something I should do. <Laughter>. How often do you, F uh, F uh, go out each week on your walking? Okay, how far, about how far do you go walking? Okay. D Well, that's good. D Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging. It, Sure. D Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, F uh, keep the heart rating going, F uh, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. C But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is. F Um, do you go to an aerobics class C or do you watch, on T V? Okay. Which, F uh, shows do you watch on T V? F Oh, okay, okay, like a Cathy Smith workout, or Jane Fonda. Okay <laughter>. Right. I, ev, every now and then I'll watch E S P N, I get cable on T V, C and they have, F uh, a couple of shows called basic training, C and, F uh, what is the other one called. Uhhuh. BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill. . Yeah, <laughter> he, he, he's not bad his assistants usually aren't either. <Laughter>. They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach. Yeah, D well, they, they do low I pact stuff now, < typo? I pact =impact > they're on every day. Yeah, every morning. It's on E S P N, F uh, at what time, I can't remember what time. It's, F uh, D you know, I can't remember offhand what time. Yeah . Yeah, every now and then. Uhhuh, D well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V. They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that. < typo incase=in case > I actually taped a few session that they had on there C but, F uh, I haven't done so much as, F uh, watch the tape that I made. C So I'm kind of bad about that myself. <Laughter> Okay, D well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness. D So, all right. Good night. Bye. Yes, C and I hate it <laughter>. How about you? Off and on D well, I guess I've been kind of off and on I've, F uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, F uh, I'd say more on than off <laughter>. F Uh, I do walking on the treadmill, C and then I do low impact aerobics. Not, not really. Yeah, and time consuming, E I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming, it's, F uh, D you know, afterwards, D you know, then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, D you know. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah, a lot of things do that. I had an, I had an exercise bike I use to have one, C and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it, C but I do use my treadmill <breathing>. Yeah, it's nice because when the weathers bad you can't, you don't have any <laughter> excuse. Yeah, I can't ride a bike C so. Oh. Yeah, it's too nice, it's been too nice all weekend. Have you ever had any injuries from jogging? I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, D you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's not quite so <laughter>, so easy. Yeah. Yeah. I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts. <Laughter> D Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months. <Laughter>. . Yeah. Yeah, D well, don't let it collect dust. At least exercise while dusting it off <laughter>. <Laughter> <breathing> D well. Yeah, that, that'll be good. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Are you going to do that? <Laughter>. D Well, that sounds like something good to do then. Yeah, nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape. D Well, I do, I switch every other day one day I walk C and one day I do the aerobics. <Breathing> D Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now I just had surgery, F um, less then two months ago, C and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half, C but I'm trying to workup to three miles. Yeah, it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect. Yeah, C but. My walkman broke, C so I'm upset <laughter>, C and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, it is C and this doesn't, D you know, my treadmill has an incline C and, D you know, you can get a really good workout on it. No, I, I just do it on T V, I have a cassette. F Um, it's a, it's a tap, I use tapes. Or, or Richard Simmons, <Laughter>. Sweating to the oldies <laughter>. Uhhuh. There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N, I don't know if he's still on any more or not, I don, I don't know if I get E S P N or not <laughter>. C But, F uh, one, D you know, I use to watch one, watch one on the air, C but that was back, That's was, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I watched that cause he was cute <laughter>. <Laughter>. C But, F uh, Yeah, yeah. C But then that was back when, F uh, D you know, the high impact and, Do they. Are the, yeah they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, F uh. I'll have to tune in. I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up, C and, C but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on <laughter>. Not everybody has a picture perfect body. I haven't watch any other ones on T V. <typo watch=watched > Just on some of the tapes. Okay, <laughter> thanks. D Now, that's a thought. <Laughter>. D Well, that's thought, I haven't thought about that, D well they're going to beep us pretty soon. Nice talking to you too. Okay, thanks. Talk to you later. Bye.
