Okay, we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing, F uh, I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, E I mean, to be doing what they're doing, F uh. When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching, C 'cause I did some teaching parttime C and I really enjoyed that C but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high, it just, D you know, all the problems. Yeah, they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week, I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready. C And, D you know, C and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid. C And we're paying basketball people, D you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, D you know. Yeah. Yeah, it's, F uh. D Now do you have little kids, or what? Yeah, yeah, my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old. C So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, D well not this coming fall but the year after that. Yeah, he's going to be going to kindergarten, C so. C So, D you know, we're, we're thinking about that. What's that going to be like. Are they going to be taught nothing, C or they going be taught something, we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education. We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, F uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, F uh, C but. C But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. D You know, C and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, D you know, we, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, D well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or un, understand some science. D You know, E I mean give me a break, that's, that's, that's bogus. Yeah. C And Dallas, F uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling. I couldn't believe that. Yeah. Yeah, we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding. I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way C but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids. That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, C and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, D you know, if it works at colleges it will work down below. C And, D you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do. C But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more. F Oh, yeah. That's right. C And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything, E I mean, good grief what's. I can't believe that. E I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened. You never heard about that. No. C And now, D you know, what do we have now. D You know, got kids that, either got a, D you know, a Magnum gun school, D like good grief. E I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, E I mean b, teaching, or even being a student C and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school. What's going to happen? E I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go. C But there again, you can't hold them back. Yeah, and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school, C and that was, D well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventynine, C so. That was what, twelve years ago, I guess. C So, D you know, it's lot different now. C And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, F uh, oldest son is in high school. I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it. <Barking>. That's all you can do. You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, D you know are kind of standoffish, still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. D You know, C an, C and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape. C And, C and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, D you know, the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera. They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad. I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, D you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time, C but, it just is amazing, D you know, need to teach them good values. Of course, wh, if I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, F oh no. C And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, D you know. Yeah. That's all you can do. That's right. D Well I got to be going, C so, F uh. Nice talking to you today. Have a good life, F uh. Okay. Fantastic. D Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, F uh, about the, F uh, funding of, the, the school system right now. Evidently, F uh, that's, that's a big problem. Right. F Oh, Lord, E I mean, yeah, C an, you talk about stress and pressure, I tell you what, it's, F uh, Do, right. Exactly, C and, <Laughter> That's right, C and then they, F uh, poof it off, D you know, do like Tarpley. C But, F uh, I what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, F uh, E or, our state legislature can't come up with, F uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school. D You know, it's, F uh, I just don't understand that. No, F uh, sure don't, my wife and I've just been married about two years C but I have a sister that's a, F uh, school teacher, C and, F uh. Okay. Okay, C so it's getting close. Right. Right. Exactly. Right, that's true. Exactly. Right, right. D Well C and, F uh, D you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, i, are, F uh, private schools. D You know whether, F uh, F uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're g, growing up, because, D you know, just in the Dallas area, F um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools. Right. Right. D You know, <breathing> one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano. We were hoping, D you know, D well the school districts going to be good, D you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth, C but, F uh, I can definitely, F uh, see on down the road, D you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. That's, yeah, C and, D you know, that's, taxes right now are political suicide. D You know, C and I don't think any politician's going to do that, C so. Right. Exactly. C And, D you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, F uh, people, I think. Because, F uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load. D So, F uh, Yeah D now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, D you know. D Well yeah, we didn't, we didn't even think about it, D you know <laughter>. R, right. Exactly, right. Another reason, yo, C and you want to encourage them, D you know, to, to be active and everything in school, C but, F uh, D you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, F uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in. Okay. Right. That's right, that's right. That, yeah, that is a scary thought, C but, F uh, I don't know, I, I guess what you have to do is just, F uh, keep in, F uh, D you know, encouraging them and, and, F uh, F uh, try to be open with them, so that y, you can deal with the problems as they come up. Yeah, C and. Right. Exactly. That's right. Right. That's true, that's true, C and, F uh. Right. D Well C and I think, F uh, you touched on it, D you know, you've got to start them at the home. D You know that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values C and, C and, C and, F uh, C and that's about right. Then you just have to hope and pray that, that everything, F uh, works out, works out okay, C so. Okay, D well, hey, I appreciate the call. You to.
