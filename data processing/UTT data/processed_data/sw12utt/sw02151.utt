Okay. D Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea. I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people. I, I, D you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help C and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home C and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea C and, C or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for, I think it teaches kids how to grow. How about yourself? Yeah, I've, I've, that's really great. I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations. D You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that, C and they don't follow it at all, D you know. There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts. C And, C and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals C but, Oh. Senior, okay. C So, there's not, F uh, Yeah, they, they lose interest. C and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there. They're more for, I g, Not, not, yeah. Yeah, you're absolutely right <laughter>. I think it's a really a good thing. I, I like to see, of course, there's, D you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help <laughter>. C But I think, we ought to start right here at home. I'm, D you know, No, it, it, I think that, D yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here C and, C and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook. D Well, it's been really good. We talked about this for a few minutes, C and, F uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday, C but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess. It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime. D Well you take care, C and, C and, enjoy the day. Thank you, ma'am. Byebye. Okay. D Well what do you think about the idea of, F uh, kids having to do public service work for a year? Do you think it's a <breathing>, Yes, yes, def, That's true. Yeah. F Uh, I agree with you. F Uh, F uh, what I'm thinking about is back <breathing>, D well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of, i, i, D you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, D like the Boy Scouts <children> or Girl Scouts C and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities, C but these days they're not, F uh, par, parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that. C Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part o, of, of the scouting, and, D you know. They are C but parents, Yeah, they do. F Oh, no. I, I, F uh, senior. F Oh, they're just not, once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore <children>. Uhhuh. Me <laughter>. Grab, grab, grab, walk out <laughter>. Yeah <sniffing>. Yeah, C but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too. Yeah, F uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, F uh, a lot of young k, people. C But, since there is much that needs to be done here. Uhhuh. No, I, I agree with you <laughter>. Yeah. Okay. You, too. You, too. Byebye.
