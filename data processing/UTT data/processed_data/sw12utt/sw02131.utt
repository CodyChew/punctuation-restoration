F Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock <static>, I, I don't care, for acid rock, C but, F uh, I grew up with country and western, C but, F uh, just about any kind of music. I even like classical music. Yeah. Yeah, I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell <static> and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs. <Laughter> C But, F uh, I, did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway? Oh. That is fabulous. We, Yeah, when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing. Yeah, C and, F uh, it was tremendous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uhhuh, C and it was, F uh, mostly all Irish tunes, they had a band with him that, F uh, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, F uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, F uh, drum, C and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth, it was just fabulous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. I love, F uh, I, li, I especially like instrumentals. Yeah. I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good instrumental <<volume got louder>> on and just close my eyes and listen. Yeah. <laughter> <<pause>> I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life, I've always wanted too, I've always wished my parents <laughter> had forced me to learn the piano or something, C but, F uh, <Laughter> C but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music C and, I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, like I say the acid rock, I just do not ca, C an I don't care for rap music either. Uhhuh, no. If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. C But, I, C and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, they're good. C And, F uh, we went and saw, F uh, L, L, LES MISERABLES F oh, the music in that was fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, it, it, F uh, I can't remember how far in advance we reserved, tickets C but it was out, D you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall C and, F uh it was well worth the price. Yeah, Yeah. Just, just ever so often D you know, a real, a real good one like that one C and, I went and saw, F uh, I think it was, F uh, SUGAR BABIES, that was good, that had good music in it. F Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney C and, F uh, F oh, what's that real, F oh, not real old, A my wife she is old too, dancer, F uh, I can't think of her name. I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something. real long legs, and dark hair. I can't think of it. Yeah, C but, F uh, Yeah. F Oh, yeah, yeah. The Blackwoods. Yeah. Alabama. F Uh, Yeah <laughter>. . Yeah, either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior. I never have either, C and I never have figured out how he won, F uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row. Yeah. I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, F uh, probably Eddy Arnold. Uhhuh. C But, F uh, I got a, I've got about a hundred and, E or had a, F uh, some, F uh, A I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventyeight R P M records of country and western, songs, Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him <music> him. He was, F uh, played in the old western movies. He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe C or they, I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy C and, had a real raspy voice, C and, F uh, some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an, Yeah. I took them up here to Collectors Rector, Records and was able to get a little money for them C but, F uh, my m, mother and dad use to, F uh, own a restaurant, C and he had, F uh, they had a, F uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant, C and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records C so, that's where I got my, Yeah. Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventyeight R P M records. D Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, F uh, particular kind of needle C and, F uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, F uh phonograph. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, they, D you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, th, warped real easy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C But, I, I guess, D you know, the old country and western music you, back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V, C so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio, C and, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, F uh, seems like it was on a Friday, Friday or, What are your m, music interests? <Laughter>. Me, too. Oh. Yeah, I did, too, C and then, Yeah, F uh, I'm pretty diversified, too. I, I don't, I don't like acid rock either. I, <sniffing> I grew up in a small town C so, F uh, the only, <static> we only had one radio station C so it was country music, C but then, F uh, when I, <Static> F Oh, really. You're older than I am <laughter>. We don't get Channel Two. My, F uh, our cable doesn't, I wish we got that what, C but, Was it? D Well, we don't get Channel Two. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? D Now, he, he is a, F uh, actually, I did, I played flute for, almost ten years C and, C and, F uh, C so, I, I, I appreciate his too, his, his mus, he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he? Was i, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, he, he is really good. Yeah, I, I, I come from a musical background, C so, F uh, F uh, I've played fl, flute, flute and piano, C so, I, I, I have a b, big appreciation for music, up to a point. I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming an, and much of the new stuff that's coming out, my husband says I'm getting old <laughter>. Do you? Yeah, that's, that's nice to do, that is. <breathing> I've got a, <laughter> I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting, I'm getting well versed in, in kiddy music <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. I was one of the forced ones <laughter>. F Oh, I could never do that <laughter>. I was never that brave C but, F uh, <noise> <sniffing> yeah. Yeah, F oh, yeah, I've, I've done, I've done that at church too. I haven't done that in a long time. C So, let's see what els,. D Well, what kind of music do you not like? F Oh, go, that's not music <laughter>, that is not, I don't know what that is, C but that's not music <laughter>. D Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music, it's just, it's just, F uh, F uh, talking in a beat, it is just, it's not exciting at all it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation, you can't dance to it, you can't do anything to it <laughter>. Yeah. D, Yeah. <Breathing> Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony? Have you? Is i, are, are they good? Are they? I, I have, I have, never been. F Oh, really? I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really, I heard that was hard to get tickets to. . Yeah. Yeah, that was a real, Was it? I, I bet it was, I, I really bet it was <sniffing>. Is that the only, F uh, musical, do you go see a lot of musicals? Yeah. That, that would be, that would be nice <laughter>. Was it? How, how, I can't, I don't know what that's about. <Laughter>. F Uh, F uh, F uh, I think I know who you're ta, F oh, I know who you're talking about, she's got black hair, Yeah, okay, I know who <laughter> your talking about. I can't think ever her name either. Yeah, that wa, that was, that was, I remember that being, F uh, here a few years ago. <Sniffing>. F Oh, F oh, the last country music, my, my parents still, F uh, really like country, music C and they, they like, F uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers, C and, C and, F uh, D well, my, my, my, my parents, yeah, my husband likes, F uh, country music real well C and he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah, C and, yeah, he really likes Shenandoah. Yeah, yeah, D well, yeah, Alabama, I think, I think they're a bit over exposed <laughter>. I get kind, of tire, get tir, tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio. F Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, we, we watch those award shows too, we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff C but I just, I just don't care for him, I just never have. I don't, Is, is it? Okay, I, I think, I, I know who that is, uhhuh. I think my parents have <sniffing> have, F uh, some of his records. Yeah. Wow. I've heard the name. F Huh. I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie, F Huh. No, I never have <sniffing>. Yeah. Yeah, those go back quite a way <laughter>. Yeah. It's hard to, F Oh, yeah. Yeah. D Well, that wou, that's neat. that would be gr, great if they weren't too worn out, at the time. Is there not? You, you'd, D well you'd think there would be. D Well, that's true. F Oh, yeah. <Breathing>. D Well, that's a shame <Sniffing> C because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot C and you see seventyeights, a, a lot at, at the stores, a, a, at record stores, you'd, think there'd be a market for, I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them C but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked <laughter>. Oh. No. Uhhuh. D Well, those things were big and thick weren't they? You could kill somebody with them <laughter>. C And the ones you buy, go out and buy one now C and they're just so thin and, flimsy C and they just, they're not meant to last, at all, ne, neither are tapes. I, I bu, we buy cassette tapes, C and machines will eat them, C and so, the best bet, any, anymo, these days are compact disk, those things are practically indestructible <laughter>. F Oh, no. Radio. <Sniffing> Tha, that's just what, just what you had, we, C plus, I think it was better back then to, th, there's too much T V now C and the radio is, D you know, more exciting, really, than, than television, kep, your imagination i, i, kept C and yo, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. <Sniffing> Was it on the radio every week? Wha, what day, what day was that on, do you, ha, can you recall. F Uh.
