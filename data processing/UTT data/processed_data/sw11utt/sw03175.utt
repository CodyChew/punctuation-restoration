Hi, F uh, <lipsmack> D basically, I wear pants. I'm a real pants person C and, F uh, D like when I'm at home since, C and I'll say, I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing, F uh, I wear a pantsuit most of the time. Not a pantsuit, I guess pants and a shirt C and, F uh, in the summertime I wear cotton tops. Cotton top shirts C and in the winter I wear, F uh, D like sweaters. I like sweaters a lot. C And so I do that. C But when I go out for meetings <lipsmack>, F uh, then I will wear sh, either, F uh, skirts or, F uh, a dress C and I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time, C but, that's basically what I do. Oh. Right. D Well, that sounds nice. F Uh, it said the seasons, do, do you change much through the season C or, Uhhuh. Maybe. <Laughter> No. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Then may, <<faint>>. F Uh, D well, I don't have the resources to just go out and buy, buy, buy anyway <lipsmack> C and so my don't change dramatically over the years. If I need something new, I will go and buy it. C But, basically I'm a, a pretty much the same in the summertime I wear the light cotton C and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters. C And, so, it's not a whole lot of, of change for me either. C And, F uh, especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses I, I, I enjoy that, C but it just wouldn't be, F uh, smart for me to do that in my home with my children. C So, I have to, F uh, <lipsmack> think about things like that, too. I have given seminars before in, in creative writing and things like that. D Now, I don't know if they consider that a job. I don't really get paid for that, F uh, often, C but, F uh, when I do that then I, I think I become more businesslike. F Uh, C but it doesn't really change my clothing style. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, dear. That's not helpful. Yeah, I guess so <laughter>. D Well, it's been great talking to you. Have a great day. Bye. Hello. D Well, I think our tastes are fairly sim, similar, although I am I government worker, I do tend to, I'm, F uh, a scientist. C So that technically, I suppose, I could get away with, with extremely casual clothes, C but, for the most port, part I don't. I wear fairly respectable looking shoes C and C and a pantsuit of one sort or another C and, F uh, I guess dress it up with a, with a, a very nice black jacket when I have, have visitors or have to give talks. Right. <Laughter> No, D actually I guess this summer I, I wore some fairly nice jeans F uh, more than I have in previous seasons. C But, F uh, no, I tend to, to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer. I don't know whether they think by, D you know, freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during the day or something. <Laughter> C But C but, D you know, you wear a <laughter> heavy sweater in your office, <Laughter> all summer. D So, right, F uh, yeah, I don't, I don't, I, D you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends. C And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of, of secretaries was, D you know, overdress, over kill, sort of C and in a s, in a sense, the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries. Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public it, I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would, would be to spend this money here <breathing>. You know, E I mean, I suppose if you were a, a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly. E I mean, you can look businesslike in, in a pant, the same pant suit you would, D you know wear for other things. Yeah, I'm, I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics. C And so I used to have a problem when, when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash. <Laughter> D So, Right, right. C But otherwise, D now, I'm, I guess we're both pretty practical <laughter>. Okay. D Well, have a good day. Byebye.
