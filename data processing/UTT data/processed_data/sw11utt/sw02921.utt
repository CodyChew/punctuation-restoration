What part of the country are you in? F Oh, you are? East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh. Yeah. F Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County. C And, F uh, where are you from? F Oh, okay, I know where that is. Yeah, that's pretty out there. What, D well, F Oh, okay, yeah, I got my brother and my whole family there. I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now. Uhhuh <laughter>. No, my husband does. C And who, how about you? place that, that needed this. D Well that's okay. I guess it's an easy thing to do. D So you're f, you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have? F Oh, that's a, Those are beautiful. Uhhuh. Yeah, is it a, is it a working farm C or is it? More, more, I can understand that, that's probably what I would, F uh, Yeah I can hear the accent now I hear the <laughter>, I hear the Western Pennsylvania, F um. We live, F uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years. We, we originally lived in Dallas C and we met and got married C and then, F um, actually married in Pittsburgh, C and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, F uh at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, F uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I C and we're leasing a, F uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas. C And it's, F uh, near a little town called Plano, D well, it's not little any more. F Uh, yes, that's out near the airport. That's about fortyfive miles from us. It's, yeah, That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, F uh, buy down here, because we D actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, F um, MinneapolisSaint Paul is very clean D you know, in terms of, C and in terms of housing down here, F um, you really have your pick C but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy. It really is, E I mean we're, we're in a leased town home, C and it's, A F uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month. C But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living D you know, the big apartment complexes C and, C and I just have no tolerance for that. No. I pre, That's right. Yeah C but D like the town home we're in. I don't know how, E I mean, we, this is, it's like a duplex, D like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh. C And it's nice C but it's, E I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten, C and now she can't sell it. C And our neighbors, Yeah, E I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God, they paid fiftyeight for it. That's how bad it, I know. That's right. Uhhuh, yeah. I have some friends that live in Westport C and it's really, really bad. I mean you, Uhhuh. How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, D actually, C because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania <laughter>. That's not too bad. That's north. Are you going up toward, F uh, F uh, I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M, Bradford, no that's too far north. C So you're, you're not that far north then, okay. D Well, you're really not too bad. Yeah. F Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a f, few years, C or that you've, F Oh, then you have, yeah. Do you have a lot of land C or, F Oh, my, D well, then. There you go. Did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like you live in an isolated area C or, Yeah, I think that that's, F um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, F uh, indirectly C but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, D you know, the rural end of Washington, C and now it's <static> it's a terrible connection. F Oh, D well that's okay, F um, C But, C but, sub, yeah, substantially, D you know. F Um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that? <Laughter> How big is it? How many square feet do you have? D Well how many rooms do you think, yeah? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too. That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more. That's large if your kids aren't at home any more. Uhhuh. It's enough space for two people <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, okay. Yeah, right. That's okay. D Well, we've got, F um, th, this town house is pretty big. It's about eighteen hundred square feet. It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths F um, it's really nice. Yeah, it is, E I mean, I would never buy it C but leasing it is fine. F Um, C but, it's just again, the, the privacy, D you know. F Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres, C and my husband was raised, F um, on a working farm near Dayt, right, near Dayton, Ohio, C and he said, D you know, he's, he's slowly getting me to, F um, not feel isolated if we move t, to where there's more land. Right. Uhhuh. That's kind of what, D like his parents have, F uh, land that they retired to, F um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia, C and it is too far south for me, C but, F um, F um, C but E I mean, they have one of the, F um, when they said log cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, C but they built one of these. E I mean, it's just beautiful. It's like a custom, D you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins. <laughter>. D You know, E I mean, it's modern it's, Right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country it's D you know, F um, C but, F uh, I don't, what else about housing except it's, F uh, D well, Pittsburgh's housing economy, i, i, I think it's holding it's own. What part, what sections are they in? Yeah, that's nice. Great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, C and they've been in their house, F oh, probably about twelve years now C and, F um, it's, it's, D you know, they're s, going to start to see their return on their investment very soon. F Um, C but it's a beautiful home C and, E I mean, my brother lives, is it called Baldwin or Bebble? E I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, F um, it's real pretty up there. It's just, C And the neighborhoods are stable D you know. It's, F uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing. F Oh, my goodness. Uhhuh. <Laughter> That's what it is here, yeah, that's why we're at a point now we've, F uh, we're adopting C and we have been married ten plus years C and what happens is, F uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get <beep> <<high pitch>> we'll be staying in <laughter>. D So. Yeah, that's kind of like where we're, D so we're considering Pennsylvania, C and we're just kind of, D you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, D you know. A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house C and, C but I disagree with that, I. Uhhuh. I know, C and it, C and the economy here in Dallas, E I mean, it, it's steady, C but it's still not going up. C And I, F um, I just refuse to buy it, F um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, F uh, you, D you know. F Oh, I'm sure, yeah, there, E I mean, you can go down a street, C and here, he told you this, every other house, D you know, if it's been foreclosed on C or, D you know, even big executives F um, it's really, E I mean, a, C and, C and it's hard to sell the properties. People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago. C And they thought they were getting a great deal, F um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, Jean. C And it would make you ill to see this. I mean it would probably be like your house on, F uh, D you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something. Yeah, I know, C and that's, D you know, D like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit. D You know, it's across the way, C and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas, C but it's still, it's still not that private. Yeah C but you have a rider. No, C and your kids have, to tell you the truth, F um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, D you know, kind of like a homestead, <Barking> F Uh, Pennsylvania. Yeah. F Oh, are you really? What part of Pittsburgh? Uhhuh. F Uh, Clarion County. I li, we live out in the country. Yeah, we have, we have two children that live in Pittsburgh <laughter>. F Oh, F oh, you are? Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then? F Oh, uhhuh. No, I'm just, my son works for a c, a computer, F Uh, federal company, D you know, D so, yeah. F Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've D you know, remodeled. It had been, D you know, of course, a farm. It's a farm community, C and we. Ours is not a working farm <laughter>. Yeah, I have a garden C but D you know, we have a garden. C But we don't farm. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Uh, Grapevine, do you know Grapevine? Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell. He, he's living now up, F uh, in, in Maryland C but, F uh, he, <Static> li, lived in Grapevine for a long time. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, it's terrible. I, F Oh, I'm not surprised. F Uh, right, right. Right, right. Yeah, yeah, it's not good <laughter>. C And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas C but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live C and, F uh, <static> of course, most of the homes are, D you know, fairly nice, they're, F uh, done up fairly nice, F uh, Right, uhhuh, right. Uhhuh. D Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes. Uhhuh. F Oh, my heaven. D Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, C and, F uh, it's people are devastated because they paid so much for their home. C But we like our area. It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything C but, F uh, <Laughter> D Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh north. C And yeah, C and it's, it's really not, D you know, not that far. Bradford's north of us. No, no. Uhhuh. D Well, we've been here since sixtysix. F Uh, we have fifty acres. F Oh, pardon me, we have forty, we gave ten to one of our children <laughter>. No, not really, C and, C and towns keep creeping closer and closer, D you know. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, it's ours up here. We have, our rural connections are real bad <laughter>. C But we, C but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, D you know, reasonable. F Uh, yeah, we're tired of doing it though. We, we don't want to do too much more <laughter>. F Uh, F oh, golly, I really. We have, F uh, F uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry C and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, F oh we, have a half bath downstairs, too. We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room <laughter>. C And, F uh, Pardon? D Well, it really isn't too big yet. We, we li, a lot of people say that C but, F um, it's, we just like it real well C and, Yeah, we had five children, C so C and they've all moved <laughter>, D you know, on. They're all out on their own now. Uhhuh. D Well, it sounds like a good buy. Uhhuh. F Oh, that makes a big difference. Uhhuh. You really aren't isolated because it's, the advantages, your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people, C but yet you can have your friends, F uh, you can have them in, you can go out. You have more of a choice, you're not pressed upon as bad. Uhhuh. F Uh, uhhuh. F Uh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. More luxury. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Right, yeah. F Uh, they're, yeah, I suppose they are now. We, both of our children who live there have just bought a home. D Now, F Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area. C And, F uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable. They didn't have to do much to it. The other one is, F uh, F uh, has, D you know, needs more work done. It's twenty years old, I think. C And, C but they have two children, too, C and they, they bought what they could afford. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They are beautiful homes. Uhhuh, uhhuh. It is, it's real nice. Uhhuh. F Oh, my you wou, you do when you mo. When we first got married, F uh, my husband works for the state, C and we moved once a year usually <laughter>. C And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more <laughter>. Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, I do too, I've heard too many people say, I hate it here. D You know, they buy a place C and they just hate the area. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, D see. Right, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. I, I couldn't handle that <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I get tired, F uh, sometimes, mowing, <laughter> because we mow, D you know, a good bit of ground around the house area. C And I do get tired of that C but, F uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want to change it.
