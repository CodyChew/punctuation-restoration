Doug, you want to start? <Laughter>. You don't use any credit cards, I don't imagine. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, do you use them a lot? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, that's an idea, that's a thought, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. My husband loves them <laughter>. F Uh, we do use them. F Uh, we try not to, C but, he, he's one who believes in credit cards, C and he uses them quite a bit. He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month <laughter>. He, he likes that, Uhhuh. C And that's when you get into expenses. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, sometimes you do come on bargains and that, C and it's really useful. C And some places won't take, D you know, D like personal checks or cash, even C but they would take a credit card. Uhhuh. Right. We, yeah, we have the same thing up here, C so we don't deal where they do that <laughter>. We cha, D you know, we go to places where they don't charge extra. Some of them charge five cents a gallon, even, D like the gas stations more, C And, F uh, we just try to avoid, D you know, the ones that do that, we just don't, F uh, go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything extra C because D actually, to me, credit cards are the same as cash, to me they are, anyway, Right. Right, yeah. Yes. Yeah, right. D Well, I can't say we never have. Now we have, D you know, at times, made payments <Laughter> on our things, C but we try not to. We try hard, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, because sometimes, F uh, there's times when you may, maybe couldn't take advantage of something C but with a credit card you can. D So. F Uh. D Well, I think we're narrowing it down, D actually. F Uh, F uh, like I said, my husband likes them, C and we have quite a few, C but we really get, when you get down to the nitty gritty, there's probably three that we use most of the time. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, yes. D Well, it's not every week, C but you, you do get them. They make it very readily available. Almost too much so. C But I re, I really don't like it the charges that, D you know, we try to limit, look at that also, what they charge per year to use our money, D you know they're charging us to spend our money, C and, I, I'm not real crazy about that, C so we try to look at that also. Uhhuh, Right. Sure. No. Of course I use, credit cards. I have a couple of credit cards and, F uh, use them. F Oh, we try not to. We're on a pretty strict and tight budget. We use the credit cards, however, when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy. C Or we use credit cards also, if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing. D So. D So, yes, C and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where, D you know, they don't take local, they don't take out of state checks C and so when we're traveling some. Do you use credit cards often? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, well that's, that's a good thing, because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month C and they just pay the minimum required balance. Yes, C and you get in over your head. It'll, F uh, some people I know also try to use it as float where they buy something now C and say, D well, I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale C and then I can go ahead and pay for it when I get my check at the end of the month when I'm being paid. That's true. Uhhuh. Right. How a, how are the laws in Pennsylvania, F uh, as, as regard, D well not the laws, but the rates, credit card rates in Pennsylvania? For example down here, when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash. Are they the same there? <Laughter>. That's pretty steep. Yes. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes, because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase C and, C and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry <laughter>. Very good. You're, you're one of the good, I guess, good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, D well, <throat_clearing> I see that as an advantage to a credit card, also that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself. C So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um, do you have, F uh, multiple credit cards? C And do you find that advantageous C or, Uhhuh. Right. We're, we're actually in the same boat. We like to use three, F uh, basic credit cards. That way we're not confused C and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month. C And, do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail? Once a week, twice a <laughter> week, C or three times a week. Yeah. Right, D so the annual fee. Right, right, Yes, D so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twentythree percent F uh, based upon what the state will allow,
