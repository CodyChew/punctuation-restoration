Okay. F Uh, do you have young children? F Oh, D well, then you are familiar with it? Okay, I, F uh, I have grandchildren C and I know, F uh, one has gone to a, D well, two of them have gone to preschool. C And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that. Why don't you tell me what you have found. Okay, D so, Okay, C so it was in home child care. You took them to someone's home? D Well, both times? Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. I know that in raising my children, F uh, I was fortunate, I didn't have to work, we didn't necessarily have a lot of things <laughter>, C But, F uh, C and, I know my daughter, C because she has three C and, to have three in day care, D you know, even though one of them's in school full time, one of them's, D you know, in kindergarten. That is a lot of money. E I mean it's so expensive. You have to really make a lot of money. C And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life. F Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something. D You know, C and I know that one of the day cares C and it's a, a wellknown chain, F uh, she was not at all happy with. It was, there was too many children per person. They were just kind of left to play, there was no structure to, C and the middle grandson went there as a, F uh, D like a preschool thing. She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff. Not just there, D you know, C so he went D like, F uh, I think he went, D well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly. C And, F uh, D you know, C and it was supposed to be a base, D you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, D you know, school and stuff, C and, F uh, she was most unhappy with it. There was no structure, there was nothing to it. D You know, C and, F uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent. It was, it was like a little kindergarten. C And, F uh, they had hot lunches C and, C and they had classes that, D you know, one class they'd do art. They even familiarized the children with computers. F Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one. He's now five and a half. He's in kindergarten. This was last year. C And, F uh, C so, D you know, it helped him C and, C and the first one, F uh, he went to a, F uh, church preschool that was very good. The Methodist Church in Richardson. The big one C and it was a excellent, they, very good. F Oh, does he? Yeah, they, F uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run. F Oh, really? F Oh. I had, F uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, D you know experience there, that, D you know, that they were good. I I didn't know that, F uh, D you know, I'm not that familiar. I just know that, D you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it? Uhhuh. D So, D Well, are you enjoying staying home? <Laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm. Uhhuh, I have got two. One is, F uh, two C and the other one's four C and, F uh, this is my first year of staying home. I've always had them in child care. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, the, with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with C and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them C and so I found another babysitter C and she was wonderful except I thought that there were too many in the home C and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, F uh, really good child care. She was wonderful, it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home. It was in home child care. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, right. C And, F uh, C and then I worked in, in the child care centers C and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in C so I just always had a fear about, D you know, child care centers. C So that's why I put them in a, in a in home day care. Uhhuh. C And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little C and, C and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill C so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, <breathing> F uh, independent C and, F uh, I could go back to work. Yeah <laughter>. That's how it's going now. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, no, yeah. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. C And how old was he? Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. My little boy goes to the Methodist, F uh, in Garland. Uhhuh. I'm real happy with that one. D Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent. Uhhuh. Even the <throat_clearing>, even the Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to C and I'm real happy with that. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that's a, Yes, I am <laughter>. F Uh, I taught for Richardson School District C and, F uh, I taught early childhood C and I really enjoyed it, C but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time C and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them C and it just seemed like they were sick more often C and I just couldn't get the time off to, C so, Yeah, it is. It really is. Yeah, it really is. C And I felt,
