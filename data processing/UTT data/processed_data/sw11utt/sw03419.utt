F Uh, Kate, what kind of, F uh, where do you like to eat out? Yes. Do you? Have you tried Mother Mesquites? That's at Skillman and L B J there is, it's where Skillman, F uh, curves into Forest Lane C and it's real good Mexican food. Another real good one is, F uh, Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue. They're both very good. Uhhuh. Chains, uhhuh. F Oh, El Chico's or El Fenix one, uhhuh Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix. F Uh, much better. F Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites C but then fajitas are one of my, F uh, I like it better than just about anything C and they make very good fajitas there in their own, F uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful. Especially with butter and honey on them <laughter>. Yes, yes, so do I. D Well, what else do you like? Uhhuh. Yes, D now I haven't eaten there. Have you eaten there? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I, we like, F uh, F uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison C and it's a good restaurant. C And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, F uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, F uh, F uh, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful. The service is great. They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want C and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too. If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go. Fast food, D well, I can understand that. I can remember when our children were small. We lived in the Chicago area at the time, C and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out. I can't look a McDonalds in the face now. <Laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, Taco Bueno's good <laughter>. And cheap, and cheap. Yes, yes yes. Sounds like my grandchildren. <Laughter>. F Oh, yes. D Well, it's just my husband and I, C and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat. C And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners <laughter>. F Oh, no, no. I like breakfast out. I like the IHOP there in Plano. Oh. F Oh, now that's surprising because normally they're just, they're real good. I like because they, they're, even if they're crowded, they're fast service, D you know F um, don't have to wait forever for a table. C And we also like Owens, F uh country sausa, yeah yeah. We think it's good. Uhhuh. It's good. Yes, yes. C And we like Applebee's. Yeah, it, it's fun. I like your, up there in Plano, that, F uh, Country Steak House. Have you tried it? We like it because it's fairly reasonable C and they have, we go for the salad bar. D Well, we, F uh, we really like the Mexican food, D you know, here in Texas C and, F uh, C so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out, C and so, F uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, F uh, restaurant there, C and I think they have one of the best services that, F uh, that we really like it. No. Where's that at? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Really? F Oh, that, F uh, no, we haven't explored, F uh, D you know, too many places. F Um, D you know, lot of the big name brand, I guess, F uh, chains yeah, C but, F um, F oh, we've tried places, D you know, down, F uh, by the Collin Creek Mall, the, F uh, D you know, Alvarez, C and, F um, F gosh we tried, what was across the street, El Paso's El Chico's or something, yeah, something something like that, uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, yes. Yes. Oh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, I know, I tell, I tell you what. They are, they just, F um, they're excellent, F uh, excellent food. I wish I could make them here at home. Just can't make those flour tortillas. C But, D Well, I love, F uh, I love seafood C and I notice they have D like the, D you know, The Louisiana Purchase, F um, Razzoo's has opened up down, D you know, off of, F um, F um, F oh, close to six thirtyfive. Yes. I have eaten there. Now the only problem, I love the food. It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood, C but, F uh, the service has always been so strange, every time I've been in there. Mostly it's been at lunch time C and, F uh, C but I hear at night though they have, F uh, D you know, the outdoor, F um, bar, C and, F um, F uh, that's it's really, F uh, D you know, kind of lively. C So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well that sounds great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh D well, I, F uh, I have children and, and work, C and so we, F uh, we can eat a lot of fast food <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. <Laughter> I know. I, I know, I, I'm so sick of McDonalds, C and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time. C And, so now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or <laughter> some other fast food joint. F Oh and, and cheap too. Yeah, C but, C but the kids, they've got those expensive tastes C so, F uh, they like Tia's C so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff. Yeah, I know. They, they, they're just spoiled rotten, C but, F uh, C but, no, I, F uh, F uh, we love to eat out, of course, it's just so much easier and simpler yeah. C So we, F uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, me too, me too. D So, I know, F uh, I, I know that I, F uh, D you know, I just work C and I'm just tired when I get home C and I, I just don't feel like cooking. C And, F uh, D you know, on the weekends there's always things to do, C and, F uh, C so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, D now I, we've been there twice C and, C and both times I, just, F oh, the food just didn't quite settle with me C and I don't know what it was. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yes, C and I love. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, family restaurant. Uhhuh. D Now I haven't been there befo, I went to one I think in Ohio or, or, or somewhere up there, C but I've never been to that one here. I know it's just down the street. D So. D Now have you been to Applebee's. Yes. Yes, I, I really like that too, D so that was, F uh. Oh. I've been, I've been there twice, uhhuh, yeah, D so. Salad bar, yes.
