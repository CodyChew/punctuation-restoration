<Noise> <<sounds like in a room filled with people>> What do you think about the benefits in jobs? Uhhuh. Yeah, C and a lot of times they turn down your claims C so that leaves you paying for all of it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right the health insurance I have is Met Life, C and, if, it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, F uh, you just pay ten dollars C and then, F uh, the insurance pays the rest of the bill. C Or if you go outside you get, F uh, seventy thirty. Uhhuh. Right. C And, C and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway. C So, Uhhuh. D Well, I work for Sears, C and, C and, F um, that's about the, the only real benefit you have, is health insurance. Yeah, yeah, C but everybody gets vacation. E I mean, D like, F uh, T I and some other places, D you know, they have so, recreational facilities, C and they have a driving range and weight room C and, D you know, I think they even have a swimming pool C and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. D Well, I don't know, the work, the working conditions, D you know, if you could include that in benefits. Some places aren't very safe to work. C And, C and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under. Right, uhhuh. Yeah, I think so. Uhhuh <<pause>>. F Um, work, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, F um, F um, how much it costs the employers C and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now. C And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, C and, F uh, C and I don't know besides that. C But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing. D Well, D well, they still have to pay it C but they buy their own instead of going through the state. C So apparently it costs less that way. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's what I, what I think the, they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are C and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down C and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people. Yeah, the productivity and the training costs, if they have to train the same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money. D You know, C and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang onto them. Okay, it was nice talking to you. Yeah. Byebye <Noise> <<sounds like a room filled with people>>. F Um, I'm, I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have. I think that, F um, our health insurance is terribly expensive. I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money. C But, F um, D you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess. What about you? Uhhuh. C Or, C or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't. Yeah, I, I see. Now we, I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered C but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area, C and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code. C And so recently, when, when we had a claim, F um, they didn't pay the eightyfive percent they paid much lower C and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area. C And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, D you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, D you know, their statistics aren't very accurate. Yeah, I would assume that <laughter> D you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in. C But it's, it's difficult. What about other, other benefits? Are there others that you're dissatisfied with? D Well, you have vacation, E I mea, Huh. Yeah, I'm not familiar with that sort of thing, C but D you know, to me vacation <laughter> is, is an issue, C and E I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume. C And, F um, D you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, <<pause>> D I don't know, I suppose, F um, sick days. Some places count the number of hours C and some places just sort of believe you. F Um, ours is based on number of days, C and, D you know, people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill. Right. C But, F um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here <<pause>>. C So maybe that covers the topic then. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C Or maybe a ben, F uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls. F Um, C but, D you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others. C And, C and, maybe arriving late or something like that, D you know, how, how they enforce the rules. C But other than that I don't have much feeling for, <laughter> for the benefits, since, like I said, F um, I don't have a big problem with, with them. Uhhuh. F Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, F um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company <laughter> C and at least, D you know, financially in the short run, C but I would think they would get a much greater turnover C and that people would be dissatisfied working for them. Right. E I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way, C but I would assume that the productivity is way down, also. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's right. No, I agree. D Well thank you for calling. Byebye. Byebye.
