All right. F Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh. That's the way we always were. We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up. D So, D well, I guess we're going to talk about children today. D So, you ready? <laughter> <beep> My children are all gone already. They're, they're all out on their own. D So, F uh, do you want to start first yo, yo, do you work? Uhhuh. Right. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but C yet most of the problems we hear, of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers. C But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be. D You know, the individual incidence or something. Uhhuh, how old, is your oldest? F Oh, D well, he's plenty big enough then <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's the way with me. I, I worked four years one time, C but my last two children were, F uh, both entering high school age. C And, F uh, they were, of course, gone while I was w, working C so it wasn't a problem I saw, C and I stayed home the rest of the time. I, C so I didn't have that problem either. D Now I have, I, my oldest daughter she has two children C and they've been in day care, F uh, <Baby_crying> she works full time. It, it's difficult C but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home. Uhhuh. She, she surprised me though. She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, D you know, with, <laughter> with the family because she was m, the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children. <Laughter> C So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think <noise> when she is with, with the children. C And, F uh, sh, they've used the day care most of the time. They tried one once. They had a lady come in. C And, F uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her. C And it did not work out. F Uh, at all <laughter>. It, she thought it was going to. She was real excited because it was so much easier <noise> than taking the children out, in the morning, C but, F uh, I, th, the lady called C and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble. C And this baby is the, <baby> is the most pleasant, F uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually. C And, C and she was having problems with her, C and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right. D Well, my daughter decided to call them and check C and things weren't okay <laughter>. Her, her one son was watching the soapies which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies. C And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out, C and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby. C And so that ended that, <Laughter> episode, C and she was most upset, F uh, over finding this. C So, F uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better. There's, F uh, more people involved, more than one adult they, C and the age groups are separated <<very faint>>. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. Yes, story time, F uh, C and the, this one has been particularly nice. It, F uh, <lipsmack> it kept track of what they did, C and they would tell the parents what they did that day. D You know, if they said anything or did anything. C So it kind of ac, i, kept them, Yeah. <Noise> I oft, I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you <baby> would be good to get references, F uh, on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there. C Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, D you know, if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was. They may not say anything. C And, F uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, F uh, what you see, F uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing. Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. C But it would be real difficult to pick you, D you know, to find one and decide. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Yeah. <<Very faint>> Yeah. I, it worked out good. I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to babysit my <baby> two granddaughters. Since they'll be going back at the end of the month. C And so, I'm going to give it a try. I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products, C and I've got that worked out. My husband, he's retired C so he's going to deliver my products C so I'll do my orders and that by phone. C So, F um, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit. C But I th, I think I'll enjoy doing, Yeah, I, I think I'll enjoy. I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around <laughter>. A kid around or something <laughter>. Yeah. Right. That's right <laughter>. D Well, they do say you enjoy them more, a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <<Very faint>> Yeah. My daughter, always said she would not let me babysit because you do hear grandparents complaining D you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much. C But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first D Well, she lives in Utah, C so. Yeah. Okay, let's do i, Uhhuh. Okay. No, I don't, I stay home most of the time C but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when C and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of. F Um, D you know, there's a, my neighbor she tends children though C and, C and, F um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, F um, have a, a l, a law to have them certified or, or not. C And, F um, D you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that C because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to be on, get an okay seal. <Baby> That's right. That's right. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, D now, usually when I have someone tend, F um, my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere C but, before, He's almost a teenager <laughter>. Yeah, he's, he's very good. F Um, C but, F um, <lipsmack> before that I would, I would use, F uh, kids from our church, C and they did a good job, for me. F Um, C but I've never had to leave them D like in a day care center, or anything, C and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's hard. D Well, some people aren't. Yeah. F Oh, is that, <laughter> is that right? <Laughter>. I think that's really important. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Oh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, dear. <Lipsmack> Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. Uhhuh. D Well, nannies have been an option, F uh, C but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like at, maybe in, F uh, preschool would have where they have lessons and, so forth, and so on. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, D you know they might not, Right, right. You can't really. You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something, C and usually they aren't at that age. D You know, F um, Uhhuh. D Well, I know I, F uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children. C And, F uh, D you know, I, I wondered if I would have to be certified C or whether they'd just bring them C and C and we got to where, D well, we were just friends C and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them. C And then if there was a problem C and then we'd sit down, and talk about it C but it never happened, to be a problem, C and, C and so things worked out okay, C and their kids played with my kids C and it worked out well. Oh. That's great. F Oh, uhhuh. D Well, that will be great. Yeah. Yeah. I bet you'll have some great experiences with them. Yeah. <Laughter>. Sure, why not. C And, C and D you know, the grandparents, F uh, I always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of <laughter> having to, <Laughter> D So, That's right. D Well, F uh, my husband's mother lives right over here, C and she takes care of them sometimes, for me, C and, C and just is a lovely lady, C and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them. C And, Oh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
