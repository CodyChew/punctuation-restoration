Okay. Do you work? I think that's the main change. What do you think? Right. That's right. D Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago. C And I just, physically I wasn't able to C and E I mean, I love my job. C But I have four children, C and that's real hard. You have children? I assume so. Right. Right. Right. Oh. Right. Oh. It's real hard. It's real hard. E I mean even I, Yeah. It was so hard for me to work full time. Of course, my kids are, are a little older C but then you, then you give up the money. You know? Yeah. . Yep. Fine. Yep. I know. Yeah. D Well, I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career, y, which I loved. C But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones. C And I'm home when they are home. In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store, C and I'm just really hesitating, because I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever, so D like seventeen years with my kids. E I mean, D well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent C and it was wonderful. My kids and I, we just had a ball. Of course, their, their ages, they are almost seventeen fif, almo, D well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine <noise> C and we are just running every direction C and, It is. It is. Always worked. What, yeah. Right. Right. I think that, D you know, it's good. D You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they, come home C and, C and a lot of my boys, F uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over. In fact, everyday, I've got boys hanging around, C and it's wonderful <noise>. I'm real close to the schools C and, D you know, we are just I, I'm very happy to be staying home. C But again I miss, the. I don't. I keep on working. Right. That we are because it's so expensive. If we want, F uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra, <Laughter> The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy, C and then there is the gas, C and then there is the lunches and then the day care. You must pay for, day care. Yeah. F Oh my gosh. Yeah, for two. It's almost hardly worth it for you, to work until they get in school. Then you work summers unless you are a teacher. Are you a teacher? . . Uhhuh. No. It's not the same. I, I don't see things changing really, C and, C and it's terrible for divorced women D you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education. Thank goodness I have mine, C and I could get a real good paying job, if I wanted to, D you know, d, in fact, I still have offers, D you know, please come back, C and we'll pay you this. Yeah, yeah. C And it's been a real tough decision C but I'm very happy to be here with my kids. My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in, now that I'm home. Yeah. I'm real, C and I'm, C but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. I know. Right. Yeah. D Well, F Oh, that would be great. Right. I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children. Yes, I do. D Well, I think that's a big part of it C and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home C and, I almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home. C But, C but D yeah, I think that's a big change <lipsmack>. I'd like to not work. What about you? Yeah. Uhhuh. <Gasp>. Yes. I have two C and that's been a big deciding factor because E I mean I never wanted to be a career woman, C but as long as I wa, w, D you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could, as well as I could et cetera. C And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids. D Well, I have two. I have a four year old and a three year old. C And we would like two more C but I, it's like, we talked. F Uh, I don't want two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care, of them which is, something right now financially it takes both people to work. Yeah. It's full time work. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. You do there's sa, of course, D you know, everything you give up something C but I just, I, the kids are so wonderful <laughter>. C But I do think that's one of the major changes. D You know, my mama I remember her being home F uh, D you know, she made breakfast in the morning for us. C And if she worked it was part time C and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school, C and she was there when we got home. D You know, C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah. D See, C and I think, Oh. Oh. C But D see, it's such an important time to be home. D You know. C And that, was important to me enough, D you know, my husband was raised, F uh, his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked, C and he's like D well, D you know, what's the big deal about being home, for your kids. D Well, as our kids are getting older, D you know, he sees it more. I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed, Mom at school, D you know, she was there to help C or, she was there to take you, C and, C and I want to be able to do those things C so. Yeah. <Laughter>. I think that's wonderful. D So, where do you see, us changing in the future? D Well, D see that was one of the things s, the, the question I think is, D you know, what changes do we see C and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere. I think they are still going to have to work. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. The day care eats, me alive. D You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty, a month for two kids <laughter>. They would eat you, alive. I know. No, I'm not, C and I would love, you, you, you talked about having the summers off C and I thought, F oh, that would be so wonderful. C And I love the little preschool they are in. It's wonderful. D You know, C so I feel good about them being there C but it's still not the same. It's just not. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Please come back to work. Sure. That's wonderful. That's wonderful. <Laughter> I like that. D Well, we're working on it. I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be able to stay home C and my kids, of course, will be in school then C but I'll, be there mornings, I'll be there noons, I'll be there afternoons and all. I feel like, that's good C and I can work part days in my husband's business, D you know, so that, he can afford for us to do that, D you know.
