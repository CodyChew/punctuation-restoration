D So, do you fish? F Uh, from a boat or from shore? F Oh, that's nice. F Uh, mostly catfish C or, Yeah. A real light line, real light rig? D Well, that sounds like fun. Fish in Colorado s, different than that. Mostly trout in the mountains. Yeah, yeah, mountain streams and rivers. F Uh, yeah, very. D Yeah, very much there, D you know. F Um, by and large, no. C But, C but they're big fun. What? I, I, I'm a fly fisherman. Yeah, I, I cast a ways. I'm not highly proficient, C but it's fun. D Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then. You're not casting a weight on the end of the line? You're casting the weight of the line. Yeah, D well, the fly on the end weighs nothing. It weighs less than the line. C So what you do is, you strip off, F oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand. C And you whip the line. As you whip it, over your head, or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more. D Well, no, no. You fish upstream. Right. C And then you let it carry it downstream. C And then you reel it in, C and you do it again. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Jump at it. F Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern. No, no. It, it looks like a grub. Yeah. Okay, whenever you, D yeah, a lure, a fly. Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else C and it's a fly, you call it a pattern. D All right, F uh, D you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's <sneezing>, E excuse me. F Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns. F Uh, F Uh, You can buy them. F Uh, I've got some. C And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall. Yeah, yeah. You know how that changes, the phase of the moon C and, Yeah. Yeah, I, I, D You see, I'm from west Texas. Yeah. Lubbock. F Oh, another west Texan. Yeah, yeah. It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day. Yeah. D Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights. Yeah. It, at times, gets incredibly hot here. June? Oh. Yeah. Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water. It's, it's a total experience, D you know, getting out in nature and, hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and, seeing the squirrels and, camping out, and eating out, of doors C and, F Uh, I probably ought to. I just freeze. Yeah, yeah, D well, D you know, ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there. D You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it, out there, C and you know how it is. The water's kind of, C And then you're in to it just a little bit, C and then you splash in C and, the next thing you know, your knees are wet. F Uh, got a stepdaughter. She's real sweet. C And, F uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not. A fuzzy little dog. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you guys sure want to be out of range. It takes time. Yeah. Last year, we had a, F oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. F Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time. C And we still had a good time out, of the deal. F Uh, C and Colorado is a beautiful place to live. D Well, C and you've got to have, you've got to work for a living. What division you all in? What division are you all in? Oh. D Well, the only thing up here, is division one. F Oh, yeah? Okay. Yeah. F Oh, fishing's, fishing is fun up here. It's not, It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there. C But <sigh> it is fun. D You know, The, the experience is, is better up here, I think. D You know, it seems more relaxing, there's <static> more to look at. C And, C and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul <static>. D You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake, <Laughter>. Yeah, it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, it gets f, foamy almost. C And D you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth C and, F Oh, yeah. My dad has a lake cabin, C and so we go there for the small lake, F uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area. It takes us about three hours to get there. C And we go, and we fish, C and we catch a bunch of junk <laughter>. Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part, C but it's fun. From the dock, from shore. F Oh, mostly we catch carp. If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while. C And, D you know, we go ahead and eat those. C But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry. What we normally do is just, F uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, F uh, D you know, put it in a bag and freeze it. C And, C and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd. D Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there, C so we don't ever catch enough to eat. Carp is usually pretty much fun. C Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, D you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line. C And that, that's a pretty good fight. C So that's a lot of fun. Yeah. They fight hard. Yeah? Yeah, C and in the rivers and stuff? Are they good to eat? F Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big? Yeah. D Well, I've been, is that mostly, F uh, fly fishing when you're doing that C or, Are you fly fishing C or are you using a bobber? Yeah. I've never even tried that. My, if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble <laughter>. Uhhuh. With the little thing on the end. Yeah, I thought it had a weight. Oh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. F Um. C So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some? F Oh, you fish upstream? Uhhuh. You hope that they think it's a bug and, and eat it. Yeah. That's a fish? F Oh, it's a, it's a lure. I see. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Um. Did someone just come up with this design, C and, C and you're going to make one for yourself, C or are you going to buy it? Uhhuh. F Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year, huh? F Um. <Laughter> I guess so. We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures, C but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait. F Oh, are you? Where are you from? F Oh, I'm from Midland. I went to college at Tech, C so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing. Yeah. I've been up there. I didn't catch anything, C but I've been up there <laughter>. Yeah, it's fun. It's lazy. Take a picnic lunch. I used to do that with my dad. Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, we do most of our fishing at night. Just from the heat of it all. That's one advantage you've certainly got on us. It does? I've only been up there once. In the summer. D Well, no, I've been up there twice in the summer. C But both times it was really pleasant. In fact, it snowed on us in, in, D gosh, when was that? We were in Mesa Verde Park, C and it was like the end of Ju. It was just before July fourth. C And it was twentyeight, twentynine degrees. We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better <laughter>. C And here it went and it froze, C and it snowed on us. We did not know what to do about it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do, Yeah. Do you have to, do you wear waders when you fish? Oh. D Goodness, it must be a little bit cold. That's cold water around there. F Um. Do you have any, F Oh, I see. Yeah. C And you get, you get a little more carried away with it, C and you move a little closer. Yeah. <Laughter> Do you have any kids that you take fishing? Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old. C And the little one, of course, is, could care less. The, F uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, we got him a little pole last year, C and just put, F uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up <laughter>. That was what he considered fishing <laughter>. This year, he's gotten to where he can. We, we were at a friend's, F uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm, C and, C and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal, we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish. C And he started trying to cast it. C So, he, he was kind of getting there C but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now <laughter>. He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that's good. F Oh, yeah. My husband would like to live there, C but I don't know. All of our family is here C so, D Well, yeah, C but T I is up there, C so <laughter> that part of it would probably work out <static> <noise>. E I'm sorry, what? We're both, F uh, I was, F uh, military, C but he's division three. It goes back and forth. Division, D well, maybe division one right now. He's in computers. C So, C And he's in school, and everything else. I have some friends who work up there. Kathy and Kevin Guy. Yeah. C And they like to fish. They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer. Her dad has a cabin, C and they go fishing, up there. C So that would be neat to, try it some time. Yeah, long as you have a good time, that's the main point C so, Uhhuh. <Laughter> Definitely more to look at. Yeah. Yeah. The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up. We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago. C And we figured we were up a long way off. C And then it rained that night, C and we thought, D well, wonder how far off we are? C And we got up the next day, C and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away <laughter>. C And it's like, F oh, D well, maybe we ought to move just a touch. C So, that was kind of funny. Yeah, I just love the way it looks. I could almost just watch the wa, we, D in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much, C and if you were there. E I mean, it was, one time we were there, C and I guess it was late May, C so it was really your spring almost, D you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here. C And, C and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt, C and the creek was just wild, just running. C And, C and all the white water and noise C and the, it was just beautiful. Uhhuh. Yeah.
