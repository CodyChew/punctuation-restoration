<Noise> <<sounds like child's record>> Hi, I'm Carol, C and I'm calling from Garland, Texas. F Oh, okay. C Because yesterday I talked to someone upstate, I'm not even sure where, C and my husband talked to the people in Utah, C so. F Um, anyway, let me press one. Okay, F um, let me see, I think we've only planned one <laughter> family reunion in our life, C so we don't do this too often. F Um, most of my family's in California, C but my husband's is in San Antonio, C and so we did this in San Antonio, C and, F um, it was an experience that I, I won't do again <laughter>. F Um, D well, it wasn't that big of a family, C but, F um, it just got out of hand, C and, F um, C so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and, and, F um, how much, F um, beverages we were going to need and this and that, C and F oh, it just grew and grew and grew, C and, F um, when the time came, only about half that <laughter> amount of people came. C So, it wasn't, D you know, you have to really just get an accurate amount, C and, C but overall we all had a good time. We saw people we hadn't see in a while C so, No. It was all in the San Antonio area <laughter>. C But it, it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing, C and we're going, F Oh, my gosh. C So. Uhhuh, basically. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh, I think you're right. <Noise> <<child's record>> Yeah. Your family's from where? F Oh, no. Uhhuh. F Oh, those are nice. C And I'm, I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before. That's great. Oh. Yeah. That makes a big difference, too. I know everybody's real eager to participate. Yeah, D well that's great. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, more people want to come back again. Yeah, that's good. My, F uh, my grandmother in California is, F um, <throat_clearing> this is my dad's part, side of the family is planning a reunion, F um, this spring, C but we <laughter> won't be going because, F um, I don't know how they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise, C and, F um, it seems like most of the family is, F uh, going, D you know, all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are, most of them are going, C but it's too costly for us. C But anyway, they're going to go on a cruise, C and, F um, it sounds really neat, it really does. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And a friend of mine, F um, she plans her family reunion, F um, every year, C and they go camping, C and she says they have the greatest time, C and she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person, C but she said they all go camping, C and they have a really good for the whole weekend. C So, that's. Yeah, yeah. Right now we only have two children C so I, Hi. Yeah, this is I'm in Dallas. Okay <beep>. I. How big a family do you have? Did you have people coming from far away? D Well sometimes. D Well you have, you have the family lives too close together, they see each other too often they don't take that kind of thing seriously. C And if, F uh F uh, they come from far away, it's, F uh, it, it, they take it more seriously C and, Yeah. My family's not very big C but, F uh, we're kind of. D Well, I have a, a, a brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago, and my folks live back in Buffalo, New York. F Uh, I guess we have reunions about once a year or so. We got together over Christmas. My wife's family, they're, they're all in, most of them are in upstate New York. They have regular, F uh, regular family reunions every summer. Yeah, it is. Yeah, C and it's, it's just something that they, they plan on doing every summer. They just have a weekend picnic, C and every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening C and they just plan on being here. Yeah, they, they had a family reunion for, F uh, D well, for my motherinlaw at her seventyfifth birthday, C and they managed to get just about everybody, everybody into town, F uh, last November including a number of people from out in California. C So it was a, it was good, it, F uh it worked out very well. One in, interesting thing that they did at the time is they, F um, they videotaped the, the whole shebang which, it made a nice remembrance of, of the entire party. Yeah, they want to come back. D So, C so that, that works pretty well that way. Yeah, I, I can go for that. What, what do, I guess interesting if you had a, a, a very extended family that, that kind of involved a lot of people that cousins and things that you don't really know, that you've never met, it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people. F Uh, I don't know how you would go about, F uh, getting them together, C but that, that would be, F uh. Yeah, I kind of wonder what, what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family. I had hoped that our, our kids get together at least regularly.
