F Um, I have an older son, yeah. He doesn't have any children yet though. F Uh, he's thirtyseven C and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not, C but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids. That, I go out and, F uh, I play ball with them. D You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers C and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, D you know. C So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them. C So I will go out and play catch with them or D you know, we ha, let the dogs outside C and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs C but, F uh, D actually I do think that the parents should have, D you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids. No, when my son was at home, I, I did work C and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, D you know C but we always had our days off together C and we went camping on vacations. C So we had a lot of time together that way D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh yeah. D Well I am sure it was, D you know. C But, F uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids. C Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, D you know. C So, it's really rough. F Uh, I have one neighbor that's, F uh, the father is a fireman C and he works D like four days on C and it seems like he is suppose to come home for D like three or four days, C but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, D you know. C So, he's got a second job. C So he's, D you know he's not home very often. C And that's, D you know, the kids I know miss that. You know. Yeah, D you know C and I don't know, I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that D well daddy is not home because, D you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, D you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, D you know. C But, F uh, <Throat_clearing> F Oh, I am sure they would D you know. D So, are you planning on, to having any children C or, Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah. D Well that's good. That's what my F uh, daughterinlaw told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage. C And they will be married nine years <laughter>, this year. <laughter> C So, I don't know. She's a nurse, D you know C and, F uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids, C so maybe they just decided that, F uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just D you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night. You know. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh, C so, Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah, F uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children C or do you, do you work or what? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D So you have a son? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I would think so. When you, when, when your son was at home did you, F uh, working? Did you work C or were you able to stay at home with him? Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well when my mom, F uh, when I was growing up my mom worked too, C but she worked nights and, F uh, as a nurse C and so she was always home for us C and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, D you know, when I came home from school and when I worked, C but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult <laughter> thing that she did for us. Yeah. F Um. Yeah. They really do. F Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, F uh a really hard thing. Uhhuh. Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway. F Oh yeah. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. C But we are, we just got married D like, D like December, C so we are going to wait a year. C And, C Then we will try. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's a possibility. D Well, We really want to have a family. We feel like that, that couple D you know, you are not giving enough of yourself C and you should, you should be sharing your family. And giving your values, D you know, making something better of the world by raising up good kids <clicking> and letting them know they're loved and stuff. Give them, give them an edge, C but, we feel like, like the first year needs to be devoted to, F uh, making the family, the couple strong and secure in their love for each other. C But then, a family is, is definitely a high priority. D Well, D well I, F uh, I am in, I am in a different situation. I am a missionary C and I am home on furlough. It called, D like I have worked for four years in Africa C and I come home for a year. C And then we go back for four years. C But my husband and I will do the same job C and we will be living in, in Africa C and we will be working together. C So, F uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family. E I mean as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have C but, still we will share that job. C But we have, then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program D you know, that kind of thing C or do you send them away to boarding school C and if you do that when do you do it C and that's a,
