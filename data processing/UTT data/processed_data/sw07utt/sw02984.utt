Okay, we're going to talk about lawn and garden today. Okay F um, where do you work at C or do you, you wish to discuss that? F Oh, okay. Yeah, we're neighbors. Okay <laughter>. Hi <talking> <<talking to someone in background>>. Can you hang on just a minute? Thank you <talking> <<Talking to someone else in background>>. I have no idea. He didn't broadcast. Thank you. Uhhuh. I'm sorry. Go ahead. <Noise> F Oh, I do all the time. I do all the time. I get a lot of good tips from him. I have his book, too. Uhhuh. <Swallowing>. Not in Texas. <Laughter>. <Noise>. <Swallowing>. <Noise> <<Paper shuffling>>. Uhhuh. D Well, no, I had a lawn service one year, C and I thought phooey, I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost C and I said, huhuh <noise>, I can do it much cheaper and better. C And so what I did, I switched to liquid, C and I do it with an applicator with my hose, C and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory. I was surprised how easy it was. C And, i, I thought, D well, I'm going to do this all the time. C So I found, D you know, C and I've got some problems with, F uh, two trees in my front yard, C and I took them to a certified, F uh, nurseryman the other day, C and do you know what he told me I h, needed to do? Which is, a, <laughter> it's just unreal. He said I needed to pull every leave off the tree, C and the tree is fifteen feet high, C and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it C and he told me I needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase. C And I thought, D uhhuh, <laughter> this is, this is unreal, this is unreal. C So, F uh, I think I'll get my soninlaw <laughter> to do that for me, if he will. Yes, it's a disease that it's got, C and I don't know, what happened to it, F uh, C and then it it, F um <lipsmack>, D Well, one is a maple, one is, F um <lipsmack>, a maple, C but I would much prefer, I think it's not a native Texan tree. C And, F uh, the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property, C and they don't, get any care, C and they're cedar elm, C and they're just beautiful. C So E I mean, it, it's, D you know, these things that you pamper, some people have really a green thumb, C and, D you know, C and, F um, although I don't have too serious a problem, C but, I don't know if it was from the, the, the late freezes that were, or the early freezes we had, that caused this tree damage, C and D you know, Sperry said, D you know, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles, the last two years that, you, we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years. C So, I kind of think that maybe that, F uh, happened to these large trees that I have. C And I really hate to lose them, C but, F um, <lipsmack> that's one of the hazards I guess of, F uh, having a, a yard. C Because I, Uhhuh. <Noise> <<sounds like a train whistle>>. Right, the quick growing, yeah, C and they, C and he, F Uh, uhhuh <breathing>. <Lipsmack> Can I pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees? Did, are they still there, did you cut them down at the, at the ground level, C or did you pull them, up by the roots, C or how did you get rid of them? C Because if I I, I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches, C and, Oh. F Uh. Uhhuh. C Because I don't want stubs in my lawn. C Because you still have to <music>, Uhhuh. The base? To the ground? Uhhuh. Bore? I see tr, F uh, a stump killer. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Swallowing>. Yeah, C and they get that saw, C and I think it's a, k, some kind of a s, a screwing thing that just rips it right out. Right out, yeah. Used those for, F uh, mulch, sure. Sure. Uhhuh. A blessing in disguise. E I mean, y, two fold purpose. Yeah. Lawn? Yes, Uhhuh. Yes, I have a, I have a selfpropelled, F uh, Snapper. <Beep> C Because I'm sitting on a hill, C and it, F uh, C and it's very difficult to address. D Well, that's good <laughter>. They're very expensive. <Noise> <<Paper shuffling>>. F Oh, booey yeah. Yeah, they always try to give you a song and dance. Okay, C so. Right. What what, F Uh. No, I, I'm in, F uh, D well I live in, F uh, Richardson, Texas, C and, F uh, Yeah. And, F uh, but grew up in, F uh, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of <laughter> lawn and garden work. F Uh, C and F uh, Yeah. No. C So, F uh, <lipsmack> F uh, not, not growing up familiar with here, F uh, F uh, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that <laughter>. C And, F uh, Yeah. F Uh, Yeah? Don't do any, F uh, any gardening in the sense of, F uh, vegetable gardening C but, F uh, Tr, tr, tried some, tried some different, flowers, and, and, F uh, bushes and stuff, and, F uh, F uh, have a, have a lawn service. There was one when, we, when we bought the house C and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one, C but in terms of the fertilizing and, F uh, weed control, mainly leave that up to them. What about you? Yeah. Yeah. <Noise> Yeah. Yeah. D Well <noise> <<Sounds like eating something>>. D Well, good. Yeah. No. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. What, what, what kind of a, is this some sort of a disease, C or is it a pest? What, D Well, what kind what kind of trees are they? Huh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. D Well, that's, that's one thing that we a, we've had very poor luck with, with, is, in, in our yard is, is trees C but the, F uh, <noise> what, what trees were, were there when we moved in, F uh, F uh, were, had been put in by the developer when he built the house, C and he just put in whatever was cheapest <noise> that he could claim was a tree I think. And, F uh, figured <noise> up last night, at, there were seven different trees of, of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in, C and we got one left at this point, C but, <sigh> F uh, a couple of them we've lost to, <sigh> A the, w, weren't too good trees, we've lost to wind, F uh, F uh. Three we, three we've lost to, to, F uh, freezes between, F uh, eightythree and F uh, and then, F uh, a year ago we lost, F uh, another one. <Breathing>. D Well, d, Yeah, we, we didn't ha, we didn't have any that were that, that big when they, F uh, went. two o, two of them, F uh, <laughter> the wind, the wind blew over <lipsmack> F uh, in, in terms of getting them down. F Uh <lipsmack> the, Yeah. Yeah. Now th, the one that, the one that we lost, the last one that we lost a, a year ago F uh, u, up until then, they do, hadn't been big enough C but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, at, as close, close to ground level as I could, and then, F uh, got s, got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps <noise>, helps rot the, stump ki, D yeah, stump killer, and stump, stump rotter, C But, F uh, this last one had a fair sized root C and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood, F uh, and, and saw it and stopped in and asked, if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirtyfive bucks, C and I said fine. He had, he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that, C and it yeah, C and it, it just, it just ripped it right out, C and, F uh, I <lipsmack> took the, i, it left the, it left, he left the chips, C and I put them up mulch ar, around, around the other shrubs, and, F uh, F uh, had, had a pile of dirt from various things, F uh, back by the garage that I filled in with C and, C and it's filling in with, with grass, F uh, nicely this year, so that, that was, that was worth it C but, F uh, Yeah. Yeah C but, F uh, <sigh>. Yeah, D well y, do you do your own, F uh, lawn in terms of, F uh, mowing? Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, I, F uh, yeah, I, I, I, we just got a, a old push, F uh, F uh, Sears mower. I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it, C and I keep waiting for it to die, C but, every year it just seems to hang on, C and, F uh, <lipsmack> C and, F uh, I do it my, do it myself. C But, F uh, yeah, we, <laughter>, a year, a year ago I took into, took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season C and they said, no, it's, it's too old, we won't even work on it. C And I took it back home, C and it's, <laughter> can't, kept, plugs along. C But, F uh, C But, my son's, F uh, o, one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have <<voices fade>>,
