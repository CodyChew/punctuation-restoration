I'm ready. D Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California. F Uh, this little city is only about eight thousand people. C So. D Well in Patterson there's, it's not a problem here. C But D like, F uh, I lived in Oakland, F uh, until just recently C and, F uh, Oakland, California, God, they've had D like, F uh, sixtyseven murders so far this year compared to D like, F uh, forty at this time last year. C So it's really bad there. C And, C and it's all related to drugs it seems like. <Swallowing> Is that what it's there too? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well I, I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands C and, D you know, C then maybe those other people would be kind of scared C and they would not do these bad things, D you know. Yeah. I just don't understand our, our laws here. C Because, D you know, like in other countries, D man, E I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Uh, Yeah. Yeah. I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, F uh, D like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of, of the city by myself. C And, F uh, C and then, then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark D you know. C But down here, in Patterson, D well like I say, it's so small that you can go anywhere. C But just, F uh, D like twenty miles away D see in Modesto, they have, F uh, those gangs and things over there. C And it, it's bad. In Sacramento also, they have, F uh, drive by shootings it seems like all the time. C So, I don't know. I just, I just don't know what, what they can do D you know. I know. Yeah, E I mean like even, even going to the grocery store. I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, D you know. E I mean, just, <sigh> you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, D you know. C And some of the times it's happening in the daytime too, D you know, C so it's not always happening at dark. C So I don't know. <Noise> F Oh could, could be. Huh. Yeah, we, is, is crime a problem there? D like a major problem, minor problem or, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've only been here for D like, F uh, probably just over six months I start, I started school here. <clicking> F Uh, I came from a smaller town in, in New York C and cri, the city was fairly big size E or not real big C but we had a problem there C but here there's just no comparison that, much more crime. F Uh, every night the news is very depressing because it just, they run down the list of how many people were shot, D you know, drive by shootings or whatever C and it's, it, it's pretty bad. They're, they're, it's, things have basically improved here over the last few years. They've, they've actually taken steps to try to make it better C but it still, it still is a problem. D Well that's, that seems to be what they were doing C and it has, C and they've started, stepped up more patrols in certain areas C and it has has made some places safer C but, D you know, it's very difficult. E I mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to, to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it is a, it's definitely a problem C and D you know, the more, more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately. Right. Yeah, I think, I think that, F uh, it's, F uh, seems to be that, A I don't know, some people they te, they do something, D you know, they shoot somebody or whatever, they go to jail, sentenced to jail for D like thirty years they're out in five C and they're back on the street C and then they shoot someone else C and just a, a cycle <<mispronounced>> C and it seems, seems as though the, the system doesn't cha, tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done. Yeah. It's, definitely true. It seems, seems as though we try to play humanitarian I think to, a little to much C and maybe some of the people don't deserve the, the humanitarian treatment that they get. C But I don't know. It's a difficult situation I think C and some, something has to be done because I definitely think it's, it, it really plays, reeks havoc with your quality of life when, D you know, you can see it's going on around you C but then when, once it finally affects you then, then it really starts to bother you. C But it seems, E I mean, people have moved D like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime C and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out C but, D you know, it's only a matter of time before, D you know, it still catches up with them. You can't really run away from the problem C and something, D you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it. F Oh, sure. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's to bad because it's, F uh, E I mean, th, just even the random occurrences where, D you know, it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like from the car, from their car to the mall or something C and it's dangerous. C And it's just, that's just ridiculous C and D you know, it's just, that's just not right. Something D you know. Right, right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely unfortunate <noise>.
