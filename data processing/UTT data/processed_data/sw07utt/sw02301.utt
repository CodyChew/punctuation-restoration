D So, do you have any credit cards? Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I have one card. C And I try not to use it, C but right now, it's maxed out <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, I have, F uh, the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards, I think, is, F uh, you mentioned the gasoline credit card. I don't have that, C but I've got, D you know, one of the tex, the, the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases. C And we use that usually to buy gasoline, C and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, that's what they've, they've talked about it. Course it eliminates any waiting period. God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that. No. F Oh, it was, D well, they consider it to be the same as cash D well, cause it actually is. Yeah. It's better than cash <laughter>. They don't even have to deposit it, it just goes straight in there. Right. Uhhuh <dishes>. Yeah, C but I'm so glad he told me that when, that they, they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them. They paid them off, C and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them. She said at least <laughter> before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out. E I mean, that's funny. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. I, I want to still have just one just in case. C But, I'd sure want to get the, get it paid down and not use it for a while <dishes>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, our, our limit is, D you know, fairly low C and, F uh, C so that's, that's one thing that's good. <Click> F Oh, I've got another call. Okay. All right. Byebye. Yes, I do. I keep, F uh, I have an American Express, and a Visa card that I keep, D you know, kind of for emergency purposes, C and I have, D you know, I use a gasoline credit card which I, D you know, pay off every, every month. C But I've, I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, D you know, that I possibly could, C and my balances are practically zero on the ones that I have. Especially since, D you know, it's no longer after this year, C or after tax year nineteen ninety, there's no deductions for, D you know, credit card interest that you pay. C So it's a, D you know, D gosh, credit cards run, A what, anywhere from, up to eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess. It's just a bad deal. Course, there are emergencies, D you know, that you, D you know, probably need to have a card. Uhhuh, that's, that's probably enough. Absolutely. It's, it's very easy to, D you know, to do that or, D you know, to abuse it, it really is. It's so easy to pull out the plastic, C but we're trying our best not to, not to add any, D you know, credit card debt to our structure here. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'm sure you're right. I don't, I don't, I don't participate in that, C but, D you know, a lot of folks do. Yeah, at least with the, F uh, <throat_clearing> gasoline company credit cards you have, D you know, up to thirty, twentyfive, thirty days, D you know, interest free for it. C But, D you know, the instant thing may be, may, may be the way of the future to, D you know, to replace checks and every other thing. Yeah. It certainly does. Absolutely. That's right. Do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that? I see. I see, I see. It certainly is, yeah. Uhhuh. That's right. No returned checks or anything. Yeah. No, I, I understand it's becoming, D you know, the popular thing to do. We're not participating in that particular program at the moment, C and I don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to. C But, F uh, I have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards. It's just, D you know, too easy to do. That's right. <Laughter>. D Well, that's a novel idea. Yeah, that would cause you think a little while, wouldn't it. That may not be a bad idea. <Laughter> <dishes>. C But I'm kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards, D you know, as time goes by. Unless you just absolutely have to. D Now, there are times when you'd at least think you do, anyway. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's right. My wife and I really, I guess are fortunate. We're really not compulsive shoppers, D you know. We, we plan purchases, D you know, pretty well, D you know, watch for the best buys, things like that. C But, F uh, some people have a real problem with it. Uhhuh. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. F Oh, I'm sorry. Was nice talking to you. Take care. Byebye.
