D Well, F um, since I'm in college, F uh, E I mean, F uh, I haven't seen that much change <laughter>. <Laughter> I'm kind of young still, I don't know how much it changed in the last, F uh, twenty years anyway. C But, I don't know. Do you, do you have an idea of, of how much. <Laughter> Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Yeah, right. D Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days C and maybe that's changed a lot. F Uh the way, the way people dress C and, F uh. More lax? Uhhuh. Maybe a people are a little o, more openminded than maybe they used to be. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Especially with D like a lot of the different organizations now like, D you know, ProLife and, and Pro, F uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe F um, D like amnesty. F Uh, yeah, maybe people are a little, a little more, F uh, free to express their opinions, socially free. F Oh, yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Just wasn't socially acceptable. Yeah. F Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, F uh, is, is how, F um, the people's, F uh, views on, on relationships has changed, D you know, C and now we have, now we have several, D you know, we have to worry about AIDS C and we have to worry about, F uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships. Uhhuh. Ri, right. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. It used to be that we were, th, that we were trying to protect morality. Now it's we're protecting our lives. It's a it's a much different, we have, D you know, you can't just, just hope for abstinence. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. <Laughter> Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, right. Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right. I, I teach swim lessons a lot, C and, C and to see what, see what kids talk about when, F uh, D you know, they're, they're open about, D well, D you know, kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, D like we were, F uh, at that age F um, about a lot of things. D You know, besides what, besides what they learn, F uh, from, from our social environment is, F uh, their education is just amazing. Kids are, kids are learning, F uh, D you know, their math is just, every year, F uh, algebra goes down a grade, D you know, C and, C and, F uh, students learn it earlier. <Laughter>. No, I'm not that old either <laughter>. I'm only twentynine. C So, social changes <laughter> aren't that much for me either. D Well, yeah, that. I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be. Uhhuh, relaxed and laid back and stuff C and. I think so. I think so, C and a lot, I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be. Right. Yeah, I think so. I think women have come out more too, on, on D like child abuse and, and the wife beatings, C and C and like you said, pro cho, prochoice and whatnot. I think that's become more out, outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something. No, huhuh. Right. D Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, D you know and all that stuff, C and, D you know, we didn't have to talk about, D well basically her thing was just don't do it, D you know C but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it. It wasn't that long that I was that young. C And I've got a ten year old, C and, D you know, he thought, he knows about condoms, C and C and he knows about AIDS, C and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about. Uhhuh. No, I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part. E I mean that's, sex is rampant, C and it always will be, C and C and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open. E I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys, C but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college D you know, C and, C and they sit down C and they look at you right in the face C and they expect a truthful answer. You can't get them, give them, the, F oh, D you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff. They, they, that just does not go. C And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know <laughter>. C But it, it's interesting, listening to them. I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with D like our generation. Yeah, I do too. I know, D well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
