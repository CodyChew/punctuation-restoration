What are your favorite T V shows? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, I, I rather enjoy the COSBY SHOW. My wife and I both like COMMISH. F Uh, It's either Friday night, it's either tonight or tomorrow night. F Uh, around here at least. I guess it depends on what channel you're getting. D You know, what system you're getting it through. F Uh, we, we always enjoyed it. It, it seems to be kind of halfway between, F uh, something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and, F uh, HILL STREET BLUES. I, i, i, it's a good show. You t, Yeah. Yeah. H, he's tender hearted fellow. Yeah. I think that's what first drew us to him, the, F uh, <laughter> the, the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours. C But, F uh, Yeah, F uh, <Baby_crying> Yeah, F uh, I know we, F uh, we watch COMMISH any chance we get. F Uh, <baby_crying> used to be a big fan of STAR TREK, C but that's kind of, th, th, it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against, F uh, anything spiritual. C But, F uh, anyway, Yeah, I, I used to be a, used to be a real big fan of STAR TREK. F Uh, pretty much, yeah. I always enjoyed the show anyway <baby_crying>. C And STAR TREK's in a s, or the, F uh, STAR WARS set F uh, one of the first STAR WARS movie? I think I watched it some, like nineteen times. F Uh, I did at one time <throat_clearing>. Anyway, <Noise> F Oh, I u, I was a pretty big fan of that sort of thing. Used to, used to read a, read a lot of science fiction work, too. C But, F uh, no, it, F uh, we don't do a whole lot of T V watching, C but that, F uh, I don't know if you heard them or not, I got a twelve year old, twelve week old baby. Uhhuh. Yeah, that, between that and school it's not, Between him and school, there's not much time left for watching much T V. Yeah, this one here is our first. C And we're both full time students C so, Yeah. What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl? That, that's, that's the best way, you haven't found out yet or anything, have you? Yeah. That's the best way. E I mean, it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're going to get for Christmas. E I mean, D you know, It's not as much fun. Oh. Anyway, F Oh, I'm about half kid at heart anyway. I, I, The new cartoons don't seem to be worth much, C but the, F uh, D well, a couple of the, F uh, ones Disney's doing aren't too bad C but, F Oh, yeah. Yeah. The, the, the worst of the violence in the FLINTSTONES was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot. C But, F oh, shoot, E I mean, blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet, or, or, or D you know, or on all the, D you know, everything of this species, D you know, just all kinds of crud <noise>. Yeah, everything's mutations and, and and killing C and, Gone are the days of those things they use, what was it I, F uh, T N, Turner Broadcasting Network used to, used to, F uh, do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons, the old cartoons. They used to put between the first and second fea, feature at the theatre. Those old little ten minute jobs where, F uh, the real ballooned looking art work, D you know a, C and, F Uh, I guess one of my favorite ones is CHEERS. I always liked that one. They're always so funny. C And I also like the COSBY SHOW <laughter>. Those are probably my two favorites. D You know, I've watched that one time C and it was really good, C but now that's on, what, Saturday night? Is it Saturday night? Uhhuh. I can't, Uhhuh. Yeah. I, yeah, I saw it one time C and I really liked it, C but I just haven't, F uh, seen it, D you know, watched it since. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, the episode that I watched, F uh, I liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer, D you know, sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason <laughter>. C And he seems to do that sometimes <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good show. I always like, I, I like to watch D like SIXTY MINUTES and TWENTY TWENTY. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I've never gotten into the STAR TREK era <laughter>. Used to be a Trekie, huh <laughter>? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, my goodness. You must have some of their lines memorized <laughter>. <Laughter>. Wow <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Twelve week, F oh, I was going to say, I hear a baby in the background <laughter>. I imagine that keeps you busy. Yeah. D Well, we're, we're <baby_crying> expecting our first in about three months, C so I know we won't be watching as much as we do now <laughter>. F Oh, wow. That must be tough. It doesn't matter, just a healthy baby. D Well, we had a sonogram, C but we told him not to tell us, C so it's going to be a surprise <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. It's, it's not quite the same. Yeah <laughter>. I agree <laughter>. I'm sure we'll be watching more, F uh, children oriented television shows. F Oh, I am, too. I still watch cartoons sometimes, every once in a while <laughter>, when my sister comes to visit C so, D Well, D you know, it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be. D You know, I remember, D like, the FLINTSTONES and the JETSONS C and those were just kind of good old cartoons. Yeah <laughter>. Yep. Yeah, C and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
