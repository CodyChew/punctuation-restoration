Okay, Lucille, I'm on, on. C And our top, D okay, our topic was, did you hear our topic? All right, basketball. I guess I'm probably a lot like you. I'm a Dallas Maverick fan. D Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them. They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point. D You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad. I feel like everyone else, I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else. It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it. National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens. Yeah, I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, D you know. I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft. C But, F Oh, gosh, I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know. Probably the Boston Celtics. I've just always like the Boston Celtics. They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team, C and, C but they're still playing good ball. C But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too, C but, D you know, I've lived in Texas since seventyfour, C so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks. Yes, we do. D You know. Yes, I go to a few games. I haven't been to many. I'm not a season ticket holder or anything. I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years, C and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself <laughter>. F Oh, you bet. D Well, I don't know. It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team, they just, I don't know, I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good, C but, C and that can really help the team, C but they do that, they trade the nucleus of their power right now. D Well, D you know, I feel like, F uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs. I like their coach. I really like a lot, C and I just, I think he deserves a good break. I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club. I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also. This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone. You bet. I think they're fools if they ever bring him back <laughter>. Hate to put it that way. I just would not believe him any more. No. There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water C but you can't make him drink. C So, C And I think Tarpley's just a sad case. C But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad. F Oh, I think you're right. Everything has been put out of perspective now. D You know, you take a, a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twentyone when he came into the league, C and now he's probably an old age of, F uh, twentyfive or six and making all that money, D well, that's, F uh, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they, they need at that point in their life, I think. I think, D you know, it's created by, Lucille Hughes. All right, C and what, Yes. Uhhuh. D Well, I certainly am too. Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year. F Um. Yes, sir. Oh. D Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, F uh, coaches? Is that part of our problem? D Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really, E I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far. I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do. Roy, who's your next best team, C or who do you like after the Mavericks? D Well. We certainly need to support them, do we not. Do you go to the game? Yes, it does <laughter>. I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there. C But, F um, maybe next, maybe they can do some. I don't know, who do they need to trade? Yes, sir, it seems that way to me. I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have C and I'm not well versed on their capabilities, C but we really need to do something. I really. Yes, sir. C And they have just done as much as they can for that man, C and he apparently can't straighten his act out, C so we need to, to build on something more positive than that. F Oh, I do, too. I certainly would agree to that. D Well, it, F um, E I mean, you can't give, <laughter> anyone too many chances C and I think he has gone over the limit. That's right. D Well. It is tragic. I don't, F um, E I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think. Yes, sir. I think you're right. I believe that one, C so.
