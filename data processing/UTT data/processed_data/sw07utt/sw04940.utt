Okay <children>. Yeah. Is it, <noise> <<sounds like water running and she is doing dishes>> I know in here, F uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, E I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it. C But, then again <throat_clearing> I originally was from California C and, F uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California. C And, F uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner. C And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas C so, <breathing> there's... No, not in, not in Te, D well not in Dallas, that is. <throat_clearing>. Yeah. We're going there tomorrow. Uhhuh <laughter>. We're packing and getting ready to go to. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, okay. Yeah, you do then. Is it really? I would not imagine that. Huh. Huh. You learn something every day. <hum> Uhhuh. Yeah, I've seen that. Huh. Huhuh. Huh. No <squeak>. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. Right. Huh. C And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right? Yeah. Huh. <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. <static>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh <static>. That is good. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. <laughter>. Oh. <laughter>. That would be <laughter> nice. I think I saw that on T V one time. They, maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that. Huh. C But what, w, w, I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like twen, was that something maybe it was. I don't know. Huh? Huh. <laughter> Yeah, C and they're, they're very expensive too.. <laughter>. D Well, yeah. Yeah. D Well, it doesn't make sense. C Because if they want people to convert, D you know. They should make it worthwhile. Yeah. Yeah. F Um. D Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, F uh, the allergies or what C but some days it's r, very nice here downtown C and other days it's just really bad, C so, I don't know. C So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? C Or can you remember? Were you there at a? C Cause I haven't been there probably... Yeah. D Well, we were there when they had a <noise>, Okay Carol. D So, air quality. Uhhuh. Surely. You mean they don't have the, F uh, the smog alerts? Right. I, I, D yeah, I spent a summer i, i, in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there. F Oh, really <laughter>. Yeah. D Actually, I'm a California born person. I was born in L A C so I know what you're talking about. In L A, it's pretty bad. <breathing> F Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, F uh, Mexico City. Yes. The worst one for smog is Mexico City. The most polluted city in the world <laughter>. . Yeah. I know that they've, they're looking at, F uh, F uh, D you know, F uh, D you know, better running automobiles. F Uh, some things they do, w, w, one of them is they're using corn in fuel. You ever heard of that? Yeah. Methanol? Yeah. D Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn <laughter>. <laughter>. <swallowing> F Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do. C And the, F uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, D you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that. It doesn't make sense. F Uh, <sigh> C but it's, D you know, one of the most, F uh, productive crop in the world is corn. Yeah. Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that. It's interesting. They're, they're looking at, there's some work being done on, F uh, automobiles that are electrical powered <child_talking> <talking>. C And, F uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, C but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it. C So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power C and it turns off. Interesting thing about gas is when, E I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any <<mispronounced>> any energy <child_talking> <talking>. Unlike a car where it's running. A electric car it's on demand. E I mean it's either on or off. Basically. You don't have to shift <laughter>. C So you, cars become very simple all of a sudden too. Very interesting. Yeah. There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars. C And Ford and General Motors and all those compete. Right. Yeah <<very faint>>. G M, F uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, D well they actually have an electric minivan. Yeah. Their, their Caravan. C But it costs, F uh, fifty thousand dollars <laughter> right now. <child_talking> To operate, yeah. C But, D you know, people are buying them. You know whose buying them? The power company. Free, D you know, free for them. Kind of interesting so see. Uhhuh. Yeah <child>. It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. C So it's a good, good vehicle. <child_talking>. Uhhuh <talking>. F Oh, I wasn't there too long ago. F Uh. D Well, D you know, yo, going over the hills, D you know, coming into the valley? <child_talking>. You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
