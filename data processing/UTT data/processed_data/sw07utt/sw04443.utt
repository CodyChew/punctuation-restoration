Do you play? F Oh, yeah? D Well, I'm into it. F Uh, Is anybody? <Laughter>. Really? F Oh, wow. Right. Super. Yeah, that's kind of the way I did it too D actually. I, I played, F uh, just a tiny bit when I was real young C and then, F uh, I w, I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still. But, and then quit for awhile C and recently I picked it up, like you say, about a couple of years ago C and, F uh, I've been playing, D you know, off and on when I can. Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course C but I actually live in Florida C so, F uh F uh, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly. I was going to say <laughter>. Yeah, that's, that's true, all too many times. Fortunately, F uh, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look. F Uh, one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public C and that's pretty, pretty good. Yeah. Can you get D like a, a student discount type of thing C or, Yeah. What, what, what are green fees run there? Okay. That's, yeah, that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida. C But, Really. F Oh, that's super. Yeah, uhhuh. D Well, that's the way to do it though. That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. They need to get a new photography method. C Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball <laughter> that's, that's a little difficult. I mean, it, they do, they do a generally okay job C but like you said, it's, it's kind of boring D actually. F Oh, yeah? Yeah. I bet that would be. Yeah. Yeah, I've never been to a tournament. F Uh, D you know, looking at it on T V, you're thinking, man, <laughter> what a boring thing, D you know. C But, F uh, that's, that's wild though. I'll have to see if I can't get a chance to go, Right. <Laughter>. Yeah, I can imagine. What do you do for a living? F Oh, you are? Which, F uh, which university? Okay. All right, great. What are you going into? Okay. Definitely not golf, right <laughter>? Yeah. If you're good, you can really rake in the bucks. Wh, what was what was that movie that they had out? Th, there was a movie about a professional golfer C and I, I can't remember. It was on network T V a couple of times. Yeah. That's right.. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's a good thing. C But, F uh, yeah. I guess when I get back, I'm going to school in Florida D actually. F Uh, C and, fortunately, I've been able to, to play some golf on a student budget which is <Noise> real helpful, D you know. C But, it, it's unfortunate, D you know. You hear about Japan. I guess, D you know, it's, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to, D like to practice even. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. I guess they have those, F uh, driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other. . Yeah. Yeah, I, I played, F uh, F uh, eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in, in Gainesville, as a matter of fact. C And it was really wild. They were into it. D You know, they kicked our butt all the way to, Yeah, I, F uh, consider myself a hacker. How about you? Yeah, F uh, I'm not as good as I'd like to be C but it's a, No <laughter> I don't think so. F Uh, I'd started playing when I was in elementary school actually. We lived really close to a par three golf course. C And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week C and then for, F uh, <sigh> for years, I don't know, after elementary school, all through junior high and stuff, I didn't play cause I think I just got so frustrated when I was little I'd, my body wasn't, D you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff C and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back C and I've really been enjoying it. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Th, the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf. E I mean it's a great game C but E I mean to play a really nice course, you've got to have a really big wallet <laughter>, E I mean. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. I, F uh, attend the Indiana University C and it's the same way here. They have a really nice championship style course that is fairly reasonable to play on. F Uh, a little bit but not a whole lot. E I mean I, you'd think you would <laughter> C but, F uh, you don't C so. I, F Uh, D well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course. Uhhuh. My dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town C and I can play for free there C and it's a pretty nice course. Yeah. C And I guess, D well it's free for me <laughter>. Somebody's paying C but not me. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, definitely. As far as watching golf, E I mean, I can watch it on T V C but it's kind of boring. It's nice to see those who, guys. They have such good style that, F uh it's, F uh, <laughter> it's pretty fun to watch. <Noise>. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. What I really, I, F uh, had a chance, they had the P G A tournament up in Indianapolis last year C and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that C and that was really fun. E I mean you knew it I never really thought it was, would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch C but, man, it was, it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play. Right. You got E I mean it's, F uh, it's a lot more exciting than actually w, than watching it on T V. C And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around, E I mean, it's just, watching them the whole time instead of like on T V, you get to see them make a tee shot C and then they go off to some other hole C and they come back when they're putting, C but, D you know, it's really something else. F Uh, I'm a student right now. Yeah. At, F uh, Indiana University. F Uh, I don't really know. I'm a math computer science major right now. No <laughter>. I wi, it'd be nice to be a pro golfer. E I mean, it seems like that, that would be an okay life just to hang out C and, <Laughter> Yeah. Huh. F Oh, yeah? D Well, D you know, it seems like, D well you go to work every weekend. Play, maybe, one, two tournaments a month. You come in about tenth, you'd still be doing pretty well. <Laughter> C So. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. Yeah. C And those fees to join a club. D Like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control. <Laughter> E I mean you'd really want to <noise>, really be liking your golf. Yeah <laughter>, I saw one of those on T V. That is pretty wild. Yeah.
