F Uh, C so, you have children I take it? You don't? C So, it's not a very valid topic. F Uh, yes. One. Stepdaughter. Ten. C And, F uh, <laughter> you know how they are at that age, I guess. you having been ten once, yourself. F Oh, we have one. A Keeshonden. Yeah, fuzzy little thing. A fuzzy little dog. Rather, rather odd personality, he, he's fun. D Anyway, F uh, time we spend with our children. <<pause>> It seems almost as though children hate it. <laughter> Yes. Time spent with Mom and Dad is, <noise> F uh, next, is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them. Yeah. They, D you know, parents are a curse that they just have to live with. <noise> C So, it, it's interesting. C But we do spend time driving in the mountains, C and... Well. Do you work for T I? <noise> You're working then? With every passing day we wonder if we will be. It's, it's better to be employed. Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner. C And that creates family tensions. Yes. No, no. I don't have any, an, children. <laughter> F Uh, D well it varies what it is, of course, C but usually, Mom and Dad are a curse. D You know, they, they'd much rather be with friends, friends are cool, parents aren't. D Well, I remember, D well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, D you know, I, I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, F oh, just wonderful, D you know, go, go hunting, or go to the races, or, or, F oh, any number of things. C And we'd have, F um, great times, C and it seems that D well now the bank's not available. <<pause>> C And, entirely too much time is spent, my wife and I were wondering what if, <<pause>> C and, C and what if's always rough. C But, D you know, we do have our trips C and we do have our fun C and, <sigh> A I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were. Hunting and, and, Looking for arrowheads, and... F Uh, C but they don't like it. There, there, there is a difference there. C And, C and... D Well, girls at that age, Video games, boys and malls. Not necessarily in that order, and friends of course. C And, that's a little tough for fathers. Fathers don't even like malls, they despise shopping. C So, is that quality time? Yeah, if, C but there is camping C and we both enjoy that. Somewhat, yeah, yeah. Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all C and, that's somewhat fun. It's, C so what do you think about child rearing? Is, how, how would you spend time with kids? F Oh, yeah. Yeah, C but D Well, yeah, C and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy. D You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something, it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast. Breakfast and run. C And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway, C and, F uh, kids eat funny. C And little girls are worse about it than little boys. They... C Or, C or something, yeah. Go on a diet or they, they have a, D well, <noise> to some extent the public schools, or the schools in general, influence them, the eating meat kick. D You know, D like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something, I, I'm not sure. Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas. F Oh, yeah. Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock. C So, I understand about bass. C But it, C but it is interesting, I, I will tell you, yeah. Every person out there should have kids, at least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time, because everyone needs some torture in their lives. F Uh. C But, Jenny is a sweet kid. C And, yeah, we do do things, C and, it, it's funny, it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children, to go do, The money's not available. D You know, we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land. Golly! A couple, three hundred dollars. D You know, for just, for just a day, not in, D you know, a day or two, not including lodging and food and all that. It's, I don't see how anyone can afford it. C And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now. F Oh, yeah. Twenty bucks a whack now. C But, at least once you pay your way in there, at Six Flags... Yeah, yeah, food and junk to carry out. <laughter> C So that's, that's not as bad. C But, golly! D You know, Disney World or Disney Land. D Well, our problem is that, D you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or, F uh, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever. C Or you'd have to pay air fare, C and, ooh, for a family, D you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick. Rent a car when you get there and all that. Yeah. <noise> <<Sounds like she is cooking, i. e. banging pots, water, etc>> No, I don't. No, huhuh. <laughter> No, it's not. Do you have children? Uhhuh. One. Uhhuh. Ten. <laughter>. <laughter>. Yeah. Once upon a time I was. D Well, I have two dogs, those are my kids. <laughter> What kind is it? F Oh, really. Uhhuh. A what? Yeah, yeah, they're cute. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do they? <laughter> Yeah, especially when they get D like into the teenage stage. I guess. <<pause>> <laughter> Yeah, I remember when I was that age. Uhhuh. <sniffing> Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, how nice, I would love to live up there. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. <laughter> That's what I heard. <noise> <<Sounds like running water>> I've always thought about maybe transferring up there, C and I thought if I do that, I might not have a job C so <laughter>. <noise> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I know it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it does. <sniffing> C So, you only have the, you only have the stepdaughter at home? You all don't have any other children around there? <laughter>. Uhhuh. C So, how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all. <sniffing> Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <laughter> No, huhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. <laughter> Like fishing and... Yeah. <laughter> My husband will say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing C and I said, D well, you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily. <laughter> That's probably right. <door> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, if my Dad had done that when I was a kid I probably wouldn't have liked it. I go now, with my husband. C And, I enjoy it, C but... Uhhuh. <laughter> Yeah, yeah. <laughter> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I imagine. <laughter> F Uh. Huh, no, I think not. Uhhuh, she likes to do that? Yeah , yeah. D Well, that's good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. She... Huh? Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and keeping, trying to keep them away from the T V, I guess <laughter>. And, McDonald's <laughter>. I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is. <sniffing> C But, they learn from their friends, don't they? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. <laughter> This lady in our bass club, we had a tournament yesterday C and she was talking about her daughter, said, one week her daughter will, F uh, be on a no meat kick, C and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars, D you know, she just eats weird. Yeah, yeah. They're always wanting to go on a diet or something. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <laughter> Yeah. F Oh, is that where you're from? Uhhuh. Oh. F Um. Yeah <laughter>. Huh. Uhhuh. <laughter> That's the kind I like. <laughter> <laughter> My Mother used to put that curse on my sister. I hope you have kids just like yourself. <laughter> C And, my Grandmother must have put that on my Dad because he got my sister, she's just like him. Yeah, I'm sure she is. Yeah. Uhhuh. <barking> Uhhuh. <barking> Uhhuh, I know, I don't know how people can afford kids. <throat_clearing> E I mean... Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Uh. It's, F uh, I heard it's twenty bucks a whack. For adults. Yeah. That is awful high. F Oh, D well... Yeah, or twentyone. Yeah, yeah. yeah, everything's free except for the food. <laughter> Yeah. Yeah. <laughter> Uhhuh. <laughter> Really. Uhhuh. F OH, yeah. That's why I lucked out, my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we got, D you know, our air fare free C and we got... <noise>
