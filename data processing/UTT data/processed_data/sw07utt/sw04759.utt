Okay. F Uh, we keep a monthly budget. I just recently stopped working so I can be home with my kids <throat_clearing> C so we keep a monthly budget C and we try to stick to it <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. That's the kind of things that throw you off. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, how nice. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I know. We do, my husband gets paid twice a week C and so we pay all of the little bills, F uh, one paycheck and then D like the mortgage and the electric bill, D you know, those big bills the second second pay C and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, D you know, for Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing. <Laughter> Yeah, that kind of thing. C But it's nice that it's there, D you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's nice that it's there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more. We bought more things C and it seemed like we spent more. Then a lot of it was going to, F uh, daycare and that kind of thing. C So it just seems like with me staying home, we had that big cut C but we save more <laughter>. I don't know how C and I don't know why C but we it seems like we do. Yeah. Yeah, you kind of try and buy bigger quantities. Yeah. That's how I felt too. It just, you could take a little longer. And just watch a little bit more I guess. I guess that's kind of like the way we do. We, I, I don't, I don't know how it comes out. It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas, where I was working, Oh. Yeah. Yeah. <Breathing> Yeah. It adds up. Yeah, it is <laughter>. It is, yeah. Uhhuh. I have two. One is four and a half C and the other one's two and a half, C so. Yes <laughter>. Yeah, that, yeah. I just came back to find jeans for the little one C and it does add up. Yeah. C But, F uh, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. D Well, that, that's, that's hard. C But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can <laughter>. For the, I know it's not forever C and that's what's so sad C but, <Dishes> <noise> <<there are kitchen noises throughout>> <laughter> I know. It, it's really difficult here. All because there's always something breaking. Car needs tires or D you know, something. F Uh, F uh, we do ours more monthly than long range. F Uh, we, F uh, <sigh> my husband gets paid once a month C and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills. C And out of his check they take a savings C and out of my check, they take savings and retirement both, out of both checks. C So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save. F Uh, his check, once a month, <noise> pays all the bills. My check, weekly, buys groceries and gas and D you know, that kind of thing <laughter> C and it works out real well that way. We don't run into a lot of problems C but budgets are horrible. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them, D well send me some money <laughter>. Yeah. it, F uh, it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings C but we do. Yeah, it, I'm just glad that it is there for car insurance, medical bills, whatever happens. C But, F uh, I know. C But I, you, it's just really is difficult. F Uh, neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years. C And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much. Groceries are outrageous C and I keep saying my check does less and less <laughter> C but, Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well I, F uh, I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, F uh D well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that. C And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, F uh, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, a lot, F uh, better. Yeah. D Well, y, <Barking>. D Well, I'm sure you do. F Uh, I do not, D well I do not have to pay child care during the winter. My son's old enough that he likes to come home F uh, from school. C But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself. So in the summer I have that extra C and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities C and that's usually movies one day, skating one day <laughter>. Swimming one day <laughter>. Yes. C So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week C and that's a lot of money. C But D you know, if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there. Ho, do you have two children? D Well they're expensive too. F Uh, just the outgrowing of their clothes C so I'm sure the budget, Yeah. C And medical bill. Although the insurance we had was good, F uh, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front C and then you were reimbursed. C So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the, <Laughter> insurance, C but in the meantime you had to put out the money first. <Throat_clearing>. C But, Yeah, it is. F Oh, I would too. I would, I would advise anyone that could possibly do it to, to, D Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever. I don't know though <dishes> <noise> <<kitchen noises>>.
