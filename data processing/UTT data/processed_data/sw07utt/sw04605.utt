Okay. Do you work with a company that, F uh, gives drug testing <sniffing>? <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, they do? Uhhuh. What, F uh, did they do that before you went in or what? F Oh, they will, huh? Oh. Okay. D Well, I've, I worked, I don't work right now because my company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt C but, F uh, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires they was going drug, F uh, give them drug tests. C But, F uh, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there, D you know, just stayed there because it was, they had been there for a long, long time. C But, F uh, <swallowing> D actually, I think they should do it. D You know, F uh, I don't think anybody needs anybody that's, to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind <laughter> D you know. C But, F uh, I don't know whether I believe that they should just randomly do it. I think they should kind of warn them, like, D you know, D well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, D you know that this is what is going to happen. C And C then if you don't like it, why then, D you know, you'll have to go look for a job someplace else. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, I suppose you are right there too, D you know. F Uh, personally I, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. Uhhuh. D Well, I suppose they fire you and everything right then, huh? C Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get, F Oh I, F Oh, I see. Yeah, D well I don't either. I wouldn't even think about it <laughter>. I think anybody that does them are dumb, D you know. Yeah , really. You're so stupid, God C and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, D you know. You don't, Yeah, re, really dumb, huh. C But, F uh, <throat_clearing>. Let's see, what else was I going to say here. Yeah, I think so. I think they all should test really D you know. F Uh, it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that, I don't know what's wrong with the people, F uh, C but I think that the, the government should do something about stopping it completely. About it coming into our country. D You know, they just slap somebody's little hand, C and, D you know, D well, don't do that again C and C and then th, D you know, they'll get out C and they're right back at it again. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. C But, F uh, other than that, why, I don't know. Like I say, maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a parttime job, D you know, since my company went bankrupt C and I'll see what they do, D you know. C But, like I say, I, I wouldn't care because I, I don't, I don't even smoke C so <laughter> they can test me all I want. I wonder what if you take medicine if that would effect it. Yeah, D see now that that would be really unfair then, huh? You know. Yeah. Find out what, D you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, D you know, if that would effect it and everything. C But, F uh, D well I guess that's about all we can talk about. I think our five minutes is about up anyhow. Okay, Lewis, C and maybe I'll talk to you again. Alrighty. Byebye. Bye <clicking>. Hi <<very faint>>. Sort of. I'm a, I'm a student C but, F uh, I'm in the National Guard C and they do a little bit of drug testing. Yeah. F Uh, they, they do it before you go in C and, occasionally they'll have a, a random urinalysis. Yeah. C So you can't be smoking marijuana in, in the military anymore <laughter>. Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I believe they should too. Uhhuh. Yeah, definitely. Oh. F Uh, C But after you, you have, to do randomly otherwise people will cheat. Yeah. They, I know when I was doing my, F uh, basic training in A I T there was guys who would fool around C and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared. C So it does work, it is effective. The only problem is, D you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, F uh, you do get caught, it is kind of, kind of harsh. Yeah. F Uh, we get counseling C and, F uh, I think part of our pay is docked if we're first time offenders. I really don't, I, I haven't, I don't do any drugs C so I don't know. <Laughter>. Crazy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, wastes your future. Yeah. F Uh, what do you think about our, F uh, D like, F uh, other government agencies testing? Do you think our government agencies should test? Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, I know, yeah. They aren't. Yeah. Right now it is, it's too lucrative for the drug dealers C so th, the risks are worth it for them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh D see, that's, tha, it is a problem. Sometimes some medicines will give off a, a false positive. I've heard of, I've heard of that, yeah. Yeah. I believe you should have the testing C but they should be, like, if you get, if you get a positive, they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt. Uhhuh, yeah. D Well, it was nice talking to you Rose. Okay <laughter>. Byebye.
