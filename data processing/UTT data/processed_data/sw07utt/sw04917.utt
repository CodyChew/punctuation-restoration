<TV> an interesting topic. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Ah. Boy, you and my husband would have a whole lot in common <laughter>. <Child>. <Rustling>. <Children_yelling> Uhhuh. F Oh, really. What's the, how old is your car? Oh. Yeah. Right. <Laughter> Oh. Yeah. D So what do the Miatas run? D Well, that's not too bad. Yeah. Really? I've never driven one. Huh? Uhhuh. C And so you've done this? Oh. Okay. Oh <pounding>. Really? Yeah <<very faint>>. <Children_yelling> <Laughter> Whatever my husband buys <laughter>. F Oh, not too much. No. We, F uh, <lipsmack> <sigh> we just got rid of a <sigh> full conversion van that, that I, I, i, that wasn't me. That was my husband. He wanted a van C and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there. T V, D you know, the whole bit. C But I never drove it C so it just, it wasn't me, D you know. C And then, F Oh, I'd want a minivan <laughter>. C Because I'm with the kids all the time. Yeah. Yeah. C And, Yeah. You pick up I pick up my little one from preschool C and the whole parking lot's full of minivans. C But, D you know, I, I drive a little Subaru. <Swallowing> C And, F uh, we, I love that. I, we were going to trade that in for the van C but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that. C And, F uh, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back. Uhhuh. F Oh, really <laughter>. F Oh, really. <Laughter> <children_talking>. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing what a minivan can do. We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. And pulled the, F uh, the little trailer behind. The popup trailer? C And, F uh, it's, C so it's really amazing how much a minivan c, D you know, what it can do. No, they're not. They're probably <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. C And we, we do a lot of, F uh, driving. We do a lot of traveling. By car. C And so that's the only time that the, that the, F uh, conversion van came in handy. C But it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little. C So, F uh, <lipsmack> that was the only time we really needed it. Other than that, it got terrible mileage C and. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Children_talking> <TV>. Yes. The, F uh, type of cars that I was, F uh, I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, F uh, Mazda Miata. F Uh, the, F uh, I'm very much a, a fan of sports cars. The, <Laughter> The, F uh, F uh, F uh, though, D actually, in som, D actually if I h, I have av, I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time. I'd rather put my money into, F uh, restoring my old cars. I have a old Triumph T R Six. C And, F uh, F uh, C so, F uh, C but if I was to buy one, probably something like a Miata. It's certainly, i, I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. F Uh, D well I have a, I have a nineteen eighty, F uh, eightyfive C R X. F Uh, which is, D you know, it's, it still works fine <laughter>. C But it's, it's D actually, it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it <laughter>. C But, F uh, F Oh, those are, they're about, F uh, F uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, D you know, a bit more if you add some some options and so on C but the, F uh, yeah, that's a pretty good price C and they're, they're, they're, they're so nice to drive. F Uh, F uh, it's, it's, it's nice. They're, I've been down to a dealer and driven them. C And I've also driven one at a, something Mazda put on where, F uh, they went to, F uh, autocross events across the country. F Uh, which is where you race in, F uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, F uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest. F Uh, D you know, about a minute or so. And, F uh, very twisty stuff. C And F oh, it handles so nicely. Yeah. Yeah. It was just, it, it's just so smooth C and. Yeah. Nice car. What are you interested in? <Laughter> Yeah. You you don't get involved in, F uh, car decisions? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. I can understand. D Well would you want, if you had to decide, what would you want? Okay, yeah. They're nice. F Oh, yeah. That's perfect for that. It's not, it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive. Holds a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Minivans are nice. I have a friend who has a minivan. C And, F uh, I've driven it a few times C and, F uh, i, it's nice, it's nice. Of course, D you know, my fam, my family has always had cars like that. F Uh, in that, D you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a V W bus every since, F uh nine, about nineteen sixty or so. F Uh, F uh, they, D well, he, he used it, <throat_clearing> he often has to transport <<mispronounced>> plants or, F uh, things like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, D you know, fills the car with plants. And so on C or. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And they're not that expensive. Yeah. Mainly because everyone makes them, D you know <laughter>. You can take your choice of how expensive you <laughter> want it to be. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Yeah <noise>. Yeah. Minivans d, do pretty well. D You know, twenty, twenty, twentyfive miles per gallon or more. Some of them probably even do thirty. The, F uh, yeah. There, there's some other cars I'd like C but I, u, u, I would never be willing to send quite that much money for, F uh, D like, F uh, F uh, I'll drool over them.
