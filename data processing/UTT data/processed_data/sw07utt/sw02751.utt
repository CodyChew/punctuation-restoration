Okay, what did you buy? I'm sorry, what? F Oh, really. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh really? F Um, if I had the money, I think I would love to own a, a B M W. I don't know, I, from what, or either that or Mercedes, just because they're put together so well. It seems like they last forever. F Oh, I don't know, they're, they're not as nice looking. <Laughter> F Uh, m, to me, I don't know, I'm sure there are some that are, C but everyone I've seen is kind of plain, C but. Sherman. Where are you? Dallas. Yeah. If I had, F um, had the money, E I mean that's just, I know I never would own one, C but, F uh, I don't know. I like, my actual favorite cars i, were, F uh, like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eightyfive. I really like that body style, C but I don't own one of those either <laughter>. F Uh, Mercury Topaz. Cheap taste, cheap taste in cars, okay <laughter>. Yeah, they're all right, it's, it's a good car, E I mean, I've never had any problem with it. E Sorry I roped on Volvos then <laughter>. E Sorry I roped on Volvos then. F Oh, is it? D See I don't much about them I guess. Yeah. Really. Uhhuh. F Um, I like anything besides Japanese. Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore. I don't like Japanese cars, C But, F uh, European, I don't ha, have any, E I mean, those are the kind I usually end up liking the most. American cars, a lot of people say they, they don't last long C but I've never had any problem with, F um, my Mercury, or, my cous, my husband has a, F uh, Cougar C and he's never had any problem with it either, C so, <<pause>> <breathing> I don't know. <Laughter> D Well what are your, I guess this is your first time to buy American, C so. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Yeah. Where? Okay. <Laughter>. Yeah, this girl that works for me just bought a car down there C and sh, they, they had a problem with they, F uh, took their Camaro in to get it traded and they, they hadn't signed any papers C and they had all ready, F uh, taken it in to paint it and everything C and everything was stolen out of it C and the people, F um, wouldn't reim, reimburse them for anything. Yeah, C so, I've heard some stuff about them. C But, F um. What. Oh. F Oh, just about a week. Yeah, yeah. Really. F Oh, wow. Yeah, you too. Okay, thanks. Bye. A Ford Explorer. A Ford Explorer. Yeah, one of the new ones. C And, F um, I'd, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle I've owned. C So I would probably purchase another one, F um, I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from C but as far as, F uh, the quality seems to be there, F um, it's quiet, it's, it handles well, F um, C but I believe I'd get that or a Porsche, one of the two. No, not <laughter>, C And why would that be? What's wrong with the Volvo. Oh. What, what city are you calling from? Oh. Up in Dallas. F Um. B M W or Mercedes, yeah, D well that's a, that's a, Uhhuh. What do you presently drive? F Um, fun. D Well there nothing wrong with those, F uh. They're, they're nice veh, they're nice vehicles, nothing wrong with those. It, F um, it's just everybody has their own taste, C but D man the Mercedes are expensive. My wife has a Volvo C and it, it's nice, E I mean, D you know, it's okay an. Huh? F Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no it, it, I, I kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the G L rather than the D L C but, because they, it is the safest car on the road, F uh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, there just safe to just, that's the reason why we mainly got it. We got white C and it's the safest four door, D you know, it's good for, if you have a family, which we do. We just, we just one out C and so it's, it's, F uh, F um, D you know, they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer. D You know, I presently, I used to have a two, eighty Z, C and I'm a tall guy an, C and, F uh, they're hard to get around in traffic to see. C Because you can't see a car ahead of you, C but they're fast as lightning and all that crap. C But the Explorer, E I mean, you're sitting up on top of everything C and you can really see real well. C And I just, it's so comfortable C and, C and, F uh. C So, you're, what are your feelings about American versus European cars? Why not. That's the way it goes, I guess. Yeah, I was real hesitant C but it was <breathing>, I don't know, F uh, E I mean, I think European cars are great, course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff C and they're eas, some, some of them are easy to work on. A Volvo, being a four cylinder is very easy to work on. F Uh, excellent warranty, E I mean, just, unbelievable warranty. C And, C and, F uh, of course, Ford isn't too bad. I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle, F uh, C but all of it has to do, in my opinion with the service. and the attitude of the service, of the dealership. I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford. There's, Middlekauff Ford in Plano. Their just, their attitude is just slimy. C And, C and, F uh, I've written a, a letter to Middlekauff C and I've told them that, matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division, their still concerned about my attitude C and it, it will never change about that place. C And, F uh, C but, F uh, anyway that's my own personal comment I guess, C but. Middlekauff wouldn't? She needs to find herself a lawyer. She'd, she'd come out like a champ on that one. D So ha, have you been using, D well D anyway. That was, I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing, C but that's, they, they don't want to hear that. Is that all? A week. Good Lord, I think I started in January or February. F Oh D God, I've, I'm D like twenty some phone calls. That's why I, I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what. <breathing> <laughter> D Well D look, I've enjoyed speaking with you. C And keep smiling. Bye, bye.
