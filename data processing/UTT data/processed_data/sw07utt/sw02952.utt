Okay, what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I, F uh, like sports type things too. We like to get out and walk, C and we like the water sports too. C But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that very often. Yeah. D Well, part time. We are going to have a baby in July. C So part of my big hobby has been <laughter> trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately. Yeah, it does. I have been, Yes. Uhhuh. I have been doing some crossstitch for something I wanted to put in the nursery. C So, I have not done that in years, C but I have kind of enjoyed that. It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it. Right, yeah. C And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby <laughter>. I just go out just to, just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes, just look. Yeah, yeah, we bought some baby clothes, D yeah, last weekend at a garage sale. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. Wow! Yeah. Yeah, it is kind of a hobby, it, that is time consuming too, really, to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop at a lot of places. Right, yeah. I think that is important too. I am not going to work after the baby comes. D So, I guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies. I do not know <laughter>. Right. Yeah. Wow! Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. C So that is good. A whole fam, your whole family can enjoy those hobbies. Oh. F Oh, wow. That will make the summer go by in a hurry. Keep the kids busy. Right. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, do you consider yard work a hobby at all C or is that just a chore? <laughter>. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, no. Huh. F Oh, D well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it <laughter>. I like to put flowers out and, D you know, a few little things like that. C But as far as mowing every week, and finding time to get all that stuff done, it gets to be a chore. Seems like sometimes hobbies do that. They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun. Yeah. If it does not go quite, quite right. F Oh, no. F Oh, that is nice. <Laughter>. Yeah. Your, <Laughter> How funny. I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working, when I do not get home until fivethirty or six, and I have to cook and clean up, it is not, it is not fun. C But I think I will like it better. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah, we have done a little bit of camping. We like that. It's, there again, it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend. Oh. That sounds fun. Yeah. D Well, that sounds nice. I, I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, we have camped with some friends who have young children C and, F uh, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line. F Oh, they have so much fun doing that. C And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many <laughter>. Oh. Yeah. Skip this tournament <laughter>. Right. Yeah. Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing? It is not too hard. It is, I do not think it is as hard as D like knitting or crochet or something like that. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. I started to s, to knit a sweater. C And I got off on my rows somehow, C and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front. C And then I tore it out and threw it down. <laughter> C And I never have, picked it back up again, C and now I can't remember anything about it <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Forget it. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They are pretty easy. D Well, it has been real good talking to you. C And I hope you enjoy your camping trip. Uhhuh. Bye. D Well, F uh, I have two children, C so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now. One of the things that I have made time for is, F uh, playing softball. I really enjoy, I enjoy softball, C but I enjoy all kind of sports. I enjoy watching and participating. I really like water sports like swimming and skiing, C but I do not get to do that too often. C And then I, I really enjoy sewing, C but I do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing. How about you? Uhhuh. I, know it. It is. Do you work full time? Part time. Oh. Right. Yeah, that definitely takes over your time. <Laughter>. Is this going to be your first? Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. D Well, that is, it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it. Yeah. That is neat. Yeah. I do too. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, since I have had kids, it is kind of funny. I, I never really was much of a garage sale shopper until I had kids. C But you will probably find after your children get bigger, F uh, like when they want things like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store, you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars. C And, Yeah. F Oh, you can just get all kinds of things and kids, especially clothes and toys, they just do not use them and wear them, D you know, for that many years or anything. C So, I am, I have become a garage sale shopper. C And it is fun. On the weekends I drive around, look to see, D you know, who is selling what. C And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class. And just, D you know, all kinds of things like that, that you would probably pay thirty dollars for, C and I got them for two dollars <laughter>. Yeah. C So, Yeah. Yeah, it is. It, it does take more time. C But I do not work, C so, F uh, that is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a, have a happy growing up years C and <laughter>, Yeah. D Well, D Well, that is good. I am glad, D Well, at first, when you first have a baby, you, F uh, seems to take every moment of your time. Partly because you are not used to, D you know, juggling your time around like that. C But, eventually the, you will, you will be doing lots of stuff. C So, C But I think, my husband is real into sports too. He plays on a T I softball team and the church softball team. C And by the time he plays two games a week and I play a game a week, we go to lots of softball <laughter>. C But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we, that is getting outside and, D you know, doing things they like to do too. C So, Yeah. C And one other thing we are doing this year is, F uh, we bought Wet and Wild passes. We have never done that before, C but the kids are always wanting to play in the water. C And, F uh, like you said, unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play, it is kind of hard. C And, F uh, they have real good kiddie areas, F uh, at both of the Wet and Wild's around here. C So, we are planning on going two or three times a week <laughter>. Yeah. I think it will. Yeah. C Because my oldest daughter is in school, C and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do. C So, I think that will be a lot of fun. C So we are looking forward to that. <Laughter> D Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun <laughter>. C But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore. It's, our yard has had so many problems. It has completely died out two times. C And, F uh, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass. C So it has become a chore <laughter>. Do you and your husband like to work in the yard? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is true. Yeah. D Well, that is how sewing. I love to sew, C and, F uh, I wish I had more time to do it. C But sometimes I will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than <laughter>, Yeah. Another thing I enjoy doing is cooking. I, I like especially, it is real strange, C but I like to cook for other people. D Like I have a friend that is, F uh, pregnant C but she can't get up and walk around right now. D So, I enjoy, D you know, cooking things to take over to her house C or, Yeah. C And it, it is fun for me to do that. It is, it is something I enjoy doing. It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us <laughter>. It is kind of like when you are a kid and, and someone else's house was fun to clean, C but you did not want to do your own <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. When you are home it's, it makes a difference. It sure does. D Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that? Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend, but the next. My parents go camping a lot, C and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them C and, Yeah. We are really looking forward to it. The girls love it. They have been a couple of times, and, F uh, just getting to be outside, D you know, all the time and sleep in a tent. And that is really fun to them. C So, We are looking forward to that. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. My, F uh, my husband loves to fish. I am not much into fishing, C but, F uh, my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish C so I think it will be real good for them <laughter>. They can go fishing. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, I know. Yeah, F uh, she is really looking forward. I am hoping, that is another thing though, when sometimes your, F uh, hobbies can interfere with each other. C Because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend. C And I am saying, no, no <laughter>. Yeah. If you are doing a lot of things, sometimes you have conflicts, C and you have to decide what you enjoy the most. C So, D Well, not really right now. I keep thinking when the kids get bigger and I have a little more time, F uh, I might take up, there is, I would love to crossstitch. I think crossstitching is so pretty, C but I have never done any. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I crocheted when I was younger. It is funny, when I was in high school, I made a blanket. C And, C but D you know, I can't even remember how I did it now <laughter>. It has been so long since I did it that C but, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, D well, I did the same thing. F Uh, when I was pregnant with my first daughter, I was really bored, C and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits. It was a real pretty rug. C And I thought, D well I could use this as a gift or something, D you know. C And F oh, <sigh> it was so, it was beautiful, C but I did not realize how long it took. C And I got about two, twothirds of it done, C and then I just, I had the baby <laughter>. C And then it was just like I forgot all about it. C And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet, C and I will find that thing. C And I will think, F oh, maybe I ought to get the rest of that out, D you know, and finish it. C But, F uh, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, F uh, hobby. It seemed like people did them a lot. F Uh, F uh, people do not do that much any more. C So, it was something easy I could do <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. You too. F Oh, thank you. C And thanks for calling. Byebye.
