Okay, do you, F uh, think we should go metric? Yeah. Yeah. I think that the, I think what, E I mean, I don't know what happened last time. I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something C and, Yeah, me too. Right, C and, C and I don't quite know why it failed. F Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough. D You know, they didn't sort of encourage, E I mean businesses and things to use it, C so, D you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out C so, Yeah. Right, I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles. You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda. Right. C And, C and, C and even though the car says miles and kilometers, you don't say, I went, a hundred kilometers. D You know. Yeah. I would, I would be total loss. I think, I think, though, if there were some, D you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, D you know, C and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed A and, pardon my expression there, but, F uh, who would get really, D you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff. C But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up. Yeah. Right. D Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, A this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school. C And if they kept it up, C so let's say, imagine they had kept going, you'd have, D you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system. Not like could use it comfortably right now, C but I could convert, D you know, I could carry around a little conversion card or something C and, I could handle it for a while, C and then, C and then eventually I'd learn, C and I think that before, it was just, D you know, just a bunch of little kids using it. C And now I think there are enough people, D you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch, C and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you. We'll say F oh, it's a pain in the neck, C but it's for the better C and we'll sort of deal with it, I think. I don't know. I, I, I would hope it would, F uh, it seems like it's a reasonable system. E I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing. Right <breathing>. Centimeters. Yeah. C But I wonder if, if, C But yeah right <laughter>. Yeah. C But I wonder if that's even something that, D you know, they, they have to change immediately. They could just, D you know, sort of phase that in, C so start, D you know, from now, D like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, D you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninetytwo would have it or something. <Laughter>. That's right. <Laughter> I know the, C and, F oh, yeah, I know, though, at the, F uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under fortytwo, inches or something. You can't walk in here. You have to be under. D Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, F uh, D see, what some of them is D like, D you know, they say if you're not taller than this line. That's right. It would be a neat case where D like, where kids taught the parents, I think, D you know. C But I don't know. Eng, Eng, England is not? Oh. Yeah, C but E I mean, C but, C but virtually the rest of the world is. E I mean, it seems D like D like, D like, D like sort of stupid. E I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans C and we're supposed to be, D you know, That's right, C and, C and now we're backwards. <Cough>. No, I, I, I would think, E I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense. No, D actually, no. F Um, let's see, it's, <Cough> I don't know. F Oh, yeah, I, I always forget. I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound. I just sort of make it up. Right <laughter>. Those, those wouldn't be a problem. Let's see, how many cups equal that? I, I have no idea. I just, F uh, I know things like, D you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something. That's all I know. I, I learned that because, F uh, a friend of mine, I, I had two friends, C and, I had more friends than that, C but two friends of mine in college, I had a lot more than two, I promise. F Um, we opened a jelly bean business. C And we sold jelly beans, C and we had, F uh, no idea how many, D you know, we, we didn't bo, we didn't bother buying a scale. We'd go out and just buy, D you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something. C And we, we didn't bother buying a scale, C and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major C and he said, D well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around, C and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint. D Gee, I think, wh, I think he the calculation at home, C and it turns out that he was actually pretty close. If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer. C So, C so we were giving them a little too much, C but that was our general tendency anyway. Yeah, D well, we were, D you know, we were in, it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school, we really didn't, make, D you know, I think we were only making seventyfive dollars each profit at the end of the year. D You know, after, after an entire semester, C but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Yeah, we, we, we tended to eat a lot, C and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it, C and we had another friend, F um, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess, C and he got into a snowball fight, with the jelly beans nearby, C and he just, C and, C and some snow fell into one of the cartons. C So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off <breathing>. C And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point. F Uh, it's just, F uh, it's just the, the same, they're like an outer coating, C and there's just sort of th, this stuff you see, D you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar. I don't know. C But when you rinse them off, all you get is, F uh, is, F uh, the coating, D Well, I, I, F oh, I don't know. It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system, obviously, if it's all compatible and it, D you know, tens C and things make sense. F Um, it's, it's a switch. The problem would just be the switch over. Right. That's when I was in the elementary school years C and we all, We all learned that metric C and they were ready, we were going to be metric C and, Right. C So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric C and, C and E I mean, C and there's things that we've gone metric. We have metric cola now, you can buy that C and you can, So that, D you know, so that, we have little things that are metric, C but no one talks about, D you know, F uh, you buy nine by twelve frames, you don't buy <laughter> centimeter length frames, and cooking pans. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Right, fiftynine kilometers per gallon. Yeah. That's, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, it really would. It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, <breathing> D you know, get that in our minds, so that we could ch, E I mean C because I think our generation could make a change. It would be difficult, C but it would not be as difficult for people, D say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, D you know, buying a two liter Coke. That's <breathing>, Right. Right. Right <laughter>. Right. <Breathing>. That's true. That makes sense. D Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change, C and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license. When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, F uh, you'd be <breathing> a hundred and seventy centimeters, C and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds. C So all the dieters would be happy <laughter>. I only weigh sixteen today. That's, Right. C And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that, <Breathing> tells you how tall the robbers are when they, to hold it up. <Breathing>. Right. <Laughter>. Right. this line, which is seventythree centimeters. <Laughter> Just so you'll know, C but that would be good. That, I don't know. Right. C Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world? I know England is not metric. I, I don't think they are, because our, F um, our measurements started in England, all that began back there, C and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric. Right. We're the trend setters in the world. I don't know why we, We haven't changed to the sensible system. <<Faint>> I don't know. Right. D Well, C and it's not even base twelve for everything, is it? It, D Well, pounds, I don't even know what that, D See, C and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces. It's, E I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current <laughter> measuring system that would <laughter>, prevent me from, It's not like it's really entrenched other, D you know. A lot of stuff, <Laughter>. Right <laughter>. I don't, I didn't even know that <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, that's good. Oh. Right. Right. Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint? F Um. Right. D Well, that's, you all are nice business <laughter>. Right. Right <laughter>. Probably ate all your merchandise too. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. <Laughter>. Yeah, it's a little problem. What's inside the jelly bean? F Uh, oh.
