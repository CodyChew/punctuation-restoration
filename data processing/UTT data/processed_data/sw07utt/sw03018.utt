Okay, what are your favorite things to watch? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. We do not watch a lot of T V, we try to watch it on Thursday nights, we usually watch L A LAW, I like that real well. And CHEERS we like to watch that. F Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW. F Uh, do you ever watch that? Yeah <inhaling>. C And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons. I was sort of sorry to see it go too. Yeah. Yeah, I thought a lot of the, D like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, <laughter> I can relate to some of those things. Just the dynamics of it and everything. F Oh, really. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, you are too tired <laughter> to do anything. F Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, A I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway. Probably more worthwhile. I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really. Right, yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I have seen parts of that before, it is interesting. Do you watch sports much on T V? Yeah. Yeah. It's slow. Yeah, we are like that C and occasionally we will, D like on, if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something, we will watch a little bit of a golf tournament. C But, F uh, you can not take a whole lot of that either, it's pretty slow. Yeah. Do you wa, we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just, on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on C and, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you have cable T V? We do not either. I thought we were the only ones <laughter>, who did not have it. Uhhuh. Gosh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, we had it for awhile C and it just seemed like we never watched it any we did not have the movie channels, we just had all the normal ones, that come C and we just never watched any of them, we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it C and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour, C so we decided to just cancel it. It does improve the reception a little bit though, that's the only thing. Yeah. D Well, I can not, <laughter> F uh, think of too much else to say. Since we are not big watchers. D Well, it was nice talking to you. Bye. F Oh, F uh, <noise> let's see, I, F uh, I have enjoyed, F uh, THIRTYSOMETHING in the past, F uh, now that it has gone off <laughter>. F Uh, <noise> some comedy shows, F uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand, C but, what, what are your, what is, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, yeah, yeah, we, we wa, we try to catch that most, most nights. Yeah. It, it was kind of interesting, F uh, some people complained about, F uh, F uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it. I, I really did not think it, it was, that way. I think it had some, some good, F uh, good situations that it presented. Yeah. D Well, I think, I think a lot of people, D you know, kind of felt that way, C but they had a lot of, F uh, F uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as, as examples of things that were going on C and, C and F uh, yo, D you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, F uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems, and that sort of thing <inhaling>. F Uh, we <throat_clearing> kind of, F uh, our T V viewing has, F uh, slowed down a little bit since our <inhaling> our daughter came along, C so, F uh, that, that tends to, F uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through <noise> getting her ready for bed and everything, F uh, <inhaling> it's, F uh, very little T V time left. Yeah. <Sniffing> Yeah, that's right. No, I, I can not, F uh, I don't think there were, F Uh, I have not, I have not, F uh, F uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to <inhaling>. I, F uh, D you know, ther, I, F uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, D you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch, C but, F uh, I F uh, D you know very seldom like to watch D you know those, there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch. I like, F uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, F uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning, it's, I notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE, yeah C but it's, F uh, it's on instead of being on pub, P B S it's on regular T V. C But, it's, F uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house C and, Yeah, C so I like to watch that C and <inhaling> F uh, some, some things on P B S I like to watch C but, F uh. <Inhaling> Yeah, if it's someb, if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to be watching it C or, C or I am not a big basketball or baseball fan, if it, unless it's baseball, if it's some, if it's a team I really like, I may watch C but, F uh, <inhaling> baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V, for an extended period. Yeah, it's so slow that you just get bored, D you know, I, I will switch between <inhaling> something else and, and a baseball game going back and forth, D you know watching it. C But, I usually, if, if, if it's a football team I really like, a college team or, or pro team <inhaling> that I am fond of, I usually will sit and watch that. C But, F uh, that's the <inhaling>, <Inhaling>. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of like, like baseball <laughter>. <Inhaling>. Right. I think that that's what more people are doing C and I think that's, D you know, as, as T V, I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do, to do that, F uh, D you know, get more movies and watch. I know we, <inhaling> we have done that too in the past, F uh, we do not do it quite as much now, cause <laughter> our baby will not let us watch them. C But, F uh, D you know, we usually will, we used to rent, F uh, two or three movies on a weekend and, and try to watch. No, F uh, we live in, No. No, we, F uh, the, F uh, development we moved into was, they have it on one si, D like right across the street from us, C but when they built our section they did not, did not put it in C and <sigh> we have been there about two years now. C and they are still, still do not have it C so <inhaling>, I am hoping that, that soon they will, they will, I have contacted them about this C and they say that D well, it's, it's, they look, they, every year they look at, F uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, F uh, the most houses will be, C and so they, F uh, they look C and they, when they, when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in, put, some in, C or they will at, least consider it, C so. Yeah. F Um. Yeah. <Sigh> Yeah. I have, I put some, put in some, F uh, an antenna, a really good antenna C and, F uh, it's really helped, D you know, ours C and it's not been too bad. I have not really missed it that much, there's certain things that I have, that I want to see, D you know, occasionally, like a football game, a college game or something that happens to be on cable, <sigh> or some old movie, C but the, F uh, I, I have not been bothered by it too much. C So, Right. Okay. Alright, bye.
