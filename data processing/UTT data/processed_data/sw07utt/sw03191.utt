Now then I think that are you there? All right. Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home? Oh. Yes. D Well, what do you think can be done about that? E I mean, what can we do, D Well, I can remembe, of course I'm old enough to remember when <inhaling> the family or the church took care of all of this. We did not have to call on, on someone else, C and I feel, D no, you tell me how you feel about, Yeah. Certainly d, I worked with an agency in West Texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels C and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly. If they didn't have to, D you know, go into a kitchen my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago, C and we had finally, she didn't want to live with either my sister or me C but we, we got, found a retirement center for her, C and it was beautiful C and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there. C So until, as long as mother was, D you know mobile and got her food, C and she was with people with whom she enjoyed. Sure. Yes, sir. Uhhuh. Being a widow I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things I have to do. I have just recently retired, C and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to. C So, F uh, mother had the little kitchenette C and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha, had a microwave, had to pop her popcorn. Now this is wonderful. C But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people and, and enjoy. F Oh, I think so. D Well. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'm here. F Uh, D well, only my, F um, my grandmother, but for a very short time. F Um, she, F uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, F uh, recovery from a broken hip because she could receive more medical attention. C But, F um, that, physical therapy was there and whatever, C but I think, in visiting her there, F um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, F uh, weren't there mentally. F Uh, she was probably the only person in the, F um, whole nursing home <laughter> that, F uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her. C So that was, F uh, that was very disheartening. F Oh, yeah, it's really hard, I guess. I, I come from a family of, F um, of, F uh, take care of your elders, I guess. F Uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid, C and she lives with my aunt and uncle, C and they care for her, D you know, all around the clock. Though she's not, F uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed. C So, I guess, D you know, there's that family commitment. F Um, I know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can. F Um, Yeah. Right, yeah. Yeah, D well probably, I think, as long as the person's able to, F um, to understand what's going on around them C and I think, D you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around, C and she's still able to, F uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets Meals On Wheels which I think is a great thing, because, F um, it saves people from having to prepare food for her, because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on, or whatever, although she does most things very well, it still makes a little bit easier for her. F Uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, that, I think, D you know, it's really funny, I have two grandmothers still alive, C and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible. She's D like openly told people. She's always been very good about knowing, D yes, she's eightynine, C and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home. C But when the time comes, F um, she, and she can't do things C and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, A and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, F uh, probably with D like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette, so that if she, D you know, if she wants to fix herself something light, she can do that, C but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, F uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria C and there's other people there, C and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right, Yeah, I think, I think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, F uh, the elderly are invalids, I think that they should be able to interact with other people in an environment that they choose, if they can, if the family can afford it. E I mean, F um, D see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house, C and my parents actually said, D you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, D you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with, she's pretty, D you know, she lets people know,
