Okay, yeah, I'm originally from New York C and I go visit a lot C and their real estate up there is, E I mean ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. An apartment here, D like I live in an apartment C and my apartment is three fifteen a month C and it's just the one, it's a one bedroom. Which is still kind of expensive C but I prefer to live in, F uh, in a nice part of town because I feel safe here. C And I, I, I pay more to feel safe, D you know. You mean in a one bedroom? F Oh, nothing. Huhuh, E I mean just nothing, no microwave, we've got, I have ceiling fan, I guess that's something. It's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored, F uh, mirrored, F uh, It's Wood, F uh, listen to me I can't even think of the name of my own apartment. Woodhollow, right next to Village Green, it's on, yeah, kind of far north Waco. F Oh, okay, yeah, far north, D like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are, it's right up there, C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. that could have been used as yeah, yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. C So that looks good when you all get ready to sell, you'll probably do really well. My father used to live in Dallas, F uh, D now, he, he went back to New Jersey, we're originally from the East. C But he, F oh, really, he, F uh, D well D actually right now he lives in Rhode Island, he lived in New Jersey for a while, now he's in Rhode Island. C And, F uh, he used to like to go, C and we used to go, just every weekend just to look at houses, for no reason, we weren't buying one every weekend, but just to look at them. C And so I got a pretty good feel of, D you know, what I want when I do, D you know, get my house, whenever that is, F um. What was I going to say about that, I completely lost my train of thought. F Um, C but we, we enjoy going looking at houses C and, C and, F uh, we now, I kind of have a good idea of what I want. I know I want a big family area, F uh, yeah, fire, a fireplace, I saw this awesome house the other weekend, it was a great big family room C and it was circular C and the other side was the patio and the backyard, C and it had a built in, F uh, grill C and every, E I mean, it was, it was just, an ul, the ultimate party room, D you know, I was just going I could have a party in here. C But that's pretty nice. Uhhuh. Right, yeah I like a lot of closet space, I don't like because, I don't like to have a lot of things out, D you know, just all over the place, I like to have them kind of tucked away. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. My father had, F uh, I keep talking about my father because he owned a house, F uh, he had the kitchen, kind of a kitchen and a very long family room, it's just kind of one room C and what he did, he put, F uh, a bar right in the center, and put some, F uh, a glass rack down, so you had D like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar C and it just kind of, it kind of separated it. It was still, D you know, together, C but it just looked a lot better. C Because I personally don't like the combination rooms. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'd like a big backyard. <Laughter> F Oh really. A little hot. Try to do it early in the mornings. Uhhuh. Wow. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, D well that's good. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter> That's true, they do throw those up. Are you all planning to move anytime, are you looking for a house, or not. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, really. To find it, uhhuh. You knew that was it. Uhhuh, I'll probably, I'll probably move, C but I'll probably move to another apartment or something because I'm, I'm, I'm really, F uh, what's the word, I move a lot anyway, because the job I have I only work, like here, I'll be here for D like a year C and then I'll move off, I can move up, C and so. I'm a, I'm a news reporter. I work at Channel Six. C and so this is D like my first job C so I won't be here very long, C so I'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house, D you know, C so I'm st, staying in an apartment C and I'm not married or anything, C so. It's no biggie. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, D like I'm amazed at how much stuff I've accumulated in my apartment, because, up to this point I was in school so I'd go home every summer C and I could take all my stuff home, because I didn't have a bed or a couch or any, any of that, C but now I could not move back home. C And I just realized this, D you know, the other day, I'm going wait a minute, I can't go back home for the summer or anything, I have too much stuff. C So, it was just D like a weird transition out of home <laughter>, C so I have to move in apartments just because I have so much stuff. No, it's not, it's not. Yeah. F Oh my goodness, yeah. Uhhuh, yeah, uhhuh. There, there are tons of apartments down here, E I mean, C and it, M C C, yeah, yeah. I, I think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something. F Um. C And it's a nursing there was a nursing home or something right there. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. How often do you all come through Waco? Uhhuh. Depends on what's going on. Uhhuh, uhhuh, yeah. Uhhuh, all right <laughter>. You think, uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um. F Um. Waco to me seems, seems like it's pretty steady. E I mean I'm not a real estate person or anything, C but it, it's a real college town C and so D you know, you have these apartments C and then the, the houses are all, most of the houses are pretty nice, C and I don't, I don't, D you know really see a lot on sale or anything C and people are pretty stable here. D You know, I kind of see this as kind of a retirement community, as I always call it. Yeah. Uhhuh. Nice and quiet, C so. I don't think I could live here much longer C but <laughter>, I'll deal with it. D Well it, <Laughter> Yeah. Really, okay D well it was very nice talking to you. Okay, you take care, Okay, bye, bye. Oh. C And how big is it? Yeah. Right, D well wha, what's included in that? Like washer, dryer or, Nothing. Wow. Yeah. Which one is it? Where is tha, F Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, I, I used to live in Waco C so, Yeah, yes, yeah. Yeah, F uh, we live in a house here, C and, F uh, it's a three bedroom two bath, C and, F uh, I, it's, it, I don't know I got two numbers today, D actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent, C and, F uh, it's about sixteen hundred square feet, which is fine for the two of us. C But it, it, D you know, we looked at a lot of houses that were, had more square footage, C but they didn't use it right, D you know. It was a bunch of empty, D you know, hallway and stuff that cur, Yeah, yeah, really. C So we've used every bit of it C and our house, F um, we bought it for sixtyfour, C and, F uh, the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventyfive, C so, i, D you know, I think we were d, D you know, got a good deal on it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. F Oh really, my husband's from New Jersey <laughter>. Yeah, that's what we were looking for the first thing. Wow. Uhhuh, yeah. C But that's what we had, F uh, F uh, that's what we had looked for, was our main concern was a big living room, D you know, and big closet space, D you know. Yeah, yeah. C And, F uh, C so that's, that's what we went for first C and, C and it, D you know, we, we don't, we just have a big living room an, C and a dining room is separate, C and, D you know, some places have, D like the house next door to us that we looked at, had a living room, a dining room and a den. C But to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den. C So, we opted for the just, the whole wide room, that went from one end of the house to the other, just about. Yeah. Oh. Yeah, right, I, C but I, I think for where we are, F um, I think we got a real good deal on it C and we, D you know, we have a, F uh, the backyard is just huge. It is just really, I think another house could fit back there. C And, F uh, we really liked it, of course, when you have to mow it <laughter>, D You know in, F uh, middle of August, it's, it's kind of, a little hot, yeah. C But, F uh, it's, it's nice C and that was, D you know, a big selling point too, C and I think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us. C And they've lived there and have it all built up, D you know, they've got a whole garden and trees and everything C so it's not like, we're, F uh, kind of secluded, D you know, we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours. D You know, right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is. D Like a lot of the little model homes that they sh, D you know throw up in three days. C And, F uh. No, no, not at all, in fact, F uh, we, we talked about that just a little bit, D you know, we were joking around about, F uh, <<pause>> winning a sweepstakes, and what would we do with the money C and Steve said we'll I'll buy a bigger house C and I said no, I would just fix this one <laughter>. D You know, there's, D you know C cause we, I like where it is C and I like how it's laid out C and it took us forever to find it. C But when we found it, it was, we knew it. Yeah. Yeah. Where? F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. Right. Right. F Um. Yeah, C and that's, C and that's one thing is once you, D you know, you get into a house it's like, you get more stuff, C and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work. God, I can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff C and it actually fit, D you know. Of course we got it on, a little bit of more furniture and stuff, C but it was just unreal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, C and that's, D actually three fifteen over there's probably not real, real bad. For, for Waco C and, C and for as many, gosh as many as apartments and condo's are over there, E I mean it, it's just, C and, C and especially around Lake Shore area, that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there, C and, F uh. Yeah, C because I, I had lived in the, gosh, I'm not sure what they're called now C but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are D like right next to the baseball field, M C C Baseball field, C but. No, the ones next door to those, there were Lake Shore, there's a, I don't know what they look like now. Yeah there was a nursing home C and then there's an apartment C and then there's another apartment. C And we lived in those, those third ones C and they we moved in when they were brand new, F uh, D you know, we drive by now and think, gosh, D you know, look how much it's changed an. F Oh, every now and then, it just, we, It's, F uh, yeah, C and it's not really, now that it's sixtyfive it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there, D you know, run to the mall or run to Sam's or, or whatever. We used to run to Re, D you know, Red Lobster C but now they've got one in Killeen, C so, we don't have to run that far <laughter>. C So that's, that's about how things are C and the, seems like the market here's picking up. Yeah, I really think it is. Just for the fact that the, D you know, it's, it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale, D you know, C and I think now a lot of them are selling C and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of, D you know, just having to give it away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, I saw, I see that a lot too, there. C And it's nice too. I liked living there. <Laughter>. D Well, I guess we chewed up the house market, and apartment market for a while. You too, Tanya. All right. Bye, bye.
