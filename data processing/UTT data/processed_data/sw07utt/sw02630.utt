Okay <laughter> he did really decide to go? Uhhuh, sure I'm familiar with it, C And he, D well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine, he must have a definite profession in mind. F Oh, okay, Medium size, aren't they? Is he excited? Wow, I can, I, Uhhuh while they're east coast, E I mean, I don't know anything about their football, C but there you go. Yeah, that's, where, where you at? F Oh, okay, I'm in, F uh, suburban Dallas. No, I don't, I have a husband <laughter>. We don't have any kids yet. About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, F um, I guess, F uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea. This is true, Right, the humanities, the history, yeah, Right, right, no, no, no <laughter>. Yeah, C but they, D you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize, C And, Uhhuh. This, this is true, Yes. C And if you want to go away, right, Right. Good. Okay. C So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas, Right. Texas Aqua, yeah, Okay, D well that's, I think the other thing is, too, F um, I know I went to a, F uh, city high school in Chicago C and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were, C and economics was the choice F um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school. Uhhuh. Yeah, University of Penn, I'm originally from Pennsylvania. Pennsyl, University of Pennsylvania, Yeah, that's strong, E I mean that's D you know C and it's, it's, D well, it's a little bit, A I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. F Um, more diverse <laughter>, At Williams or Pennsylvania? At Williams, At Pennsylvania. D Well how large is Williams? Right. D Well that's not bad. Which is a lot, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's the thing to do, E I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person, C and, F uh, that has something D like either the first or second largest student population, D like fifty thousand. Combined. Yeah, that is too much, C and E I mean, I, F um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont, F Um, C and that was, this was twenty years ago <laughter>. Showing my age, Yes. Oh my God, where are you from, D well, let's not talk about that <laughter>. It's, F um, in that area. E I mean I just can't say enough about it. D Well D you know, F um, my husband's an engineer and a strong, a strong liberal arts background with, F uh, a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say D like a, a strong, F um, business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it. Uhhuh. C and they usually, Yeah, C but they usually don't. Right, C but they, no C but who does. E I mean, I think, I think all, I think the majority of people just don't know. No he looked at criteria such as location, size of school F uh, That's still pretty far though. E I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go, F Oh, that's not too bad. Yeah, he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. That could very well be C and, C So he's developing his, his, F uh, internal instincts right now. That's good because E I mean I'm sure what he said was true, that, F uh, you, D well D actually that's one of the reasons I went to, Kenyon, he we, he made a good choice. I went, I, D well I was supposed to, C but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year, it was just too far away, it was too different F uh, the level of income of lot of the students C and their attitudes was just, F um, beyond my, F um, in terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking. Right, yeah, you're right C but then I went, Yeah. Uhhuh. C And you're going to get a little bit more input <laughter> than discipline yeah. D Well I don't know how to put this either in this way C and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this C but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do. D You know C and, F um, That's right. Right. Yeah. This is very, very, Oh. They have video lectures. Yeah. Video lectures. This is true, C and E I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the, did he just make the decision today? How funny <laughter>. That's funny. It was easy for him to rule out. He knew what he didn't want that's exactly, yeah. Now is your other, E I mean we're talking about what you think, C but obviously you're experiencing it. F Uh, Did your other son, F um, A clam. F Oh, wonderful. Uhhuh. The smaller and the, C And they'll do fine in their studies, C and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school, C and, C And now he's a sen, he's a senior C or is this early admissions? C So he's, C So he's, yeah, D well sounds like you have two talented sons. I think, and a lot of people talk about, C and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on, C but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return C and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll, colleges because of that, C and I think it's rather sad, You are wonderful parents <laughter>. No, C and I agree, E I mean, my husband and I, in fact, I'm taking my L S A T s, F um, I'm thirty something and taking my L S A T s on June tenth. The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, A I'm sure, that, F uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn C and, it sounds like they're going to, D you know, they're, <Laughter> F Um, to Williams College in Massachusetts? And that he was <laughter> trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams, C and it was a very difficult choice C and, F uh, No, C but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts, About two thousand, Very excited, yes, F uh I have another son who's at their chief rival, Amherst College. D Well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, D you know, big sports, We're outside of, F uh, Washington in Maryland. How about you? Uhhuh, do you have children in, Okay, F um, D Well, I, I, one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job F uh, C but what you can't learn, F uh, on a job, is a good solid well, wellrounded education. That's right, D you know, the Renaissance man C and, F uh, C and if you get that you can, C and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job, That's exactly right. That's right. C So the advice we gave to them was, number one, visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in do you want to go away, how far from home do you want to be. What do you want in a college. Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer C so he wanted to swim in school, C but he did not want to be in a swim factory. That's right, that's the University of Texas at Austin, or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. He is very, very strong academically, yeah, C so, we've just, C but, D you know, he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked, C and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice. He did apply to a large, D you know, large group, It's got about nine thousand undergraduate. Yeah, Yeah. Yes, C and it, C but it does have the under, D you know, that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, F uh, the college of arts and sciences is, D you know, I guess about four thousand. At Pennsylvania. Williams is an undergraduate school only F um, C and it's a total of two thousand. Yeah, C so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred C and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment C but he did go on college visits, C and he liked, Yes, yes it's large, C and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that. F Oh, it's, so you, Uhhuh. C And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner? <Laughter> No C but we've been there when whose gone up there. F Oh, it's, it we went C and he was, D you know, impressed by the clean air C and he, he met the students at both schools C and he liked them. Uhhuh. That's it. The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, D you know, to apply to a school with a good technical program, C but, F uh, for, if you're going into, if D you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering. That's right. Uhhuh. No he didn't apply to any school further, the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours. Yeah, that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours C and Williams is about seven. Yeah C so, D well, E I mean he, so it wasn't, he, D you know, then the University of Pennsylvania is D like two hours from here by train and then Bucknell in midstate Pennsylvania. Yeah, C and he will, C and if, it came down E I mean, as he, he came, he's been talking to them C and, C and he came down C and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend C and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time C but then he said, D you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun. C and he said it almost back, I think it backfired. D So. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Of course, that period too was probably difficult. C But I did, F uh, my advice to him, and my hus, was that, F uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college. He had to look at himself. F Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip C and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where, especially in a Kenyon or a Williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you, That's, yeah, yeah. C And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, F uh, so that, C and he will know the professors in a small, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. That's right, that's right. C And, F um, C and it's just the personal contact where if you need help he had, I told him to look to yourself. Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up C but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures C and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching. They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups. he made the decision, F uh, I'd say, about, F uh, an hour and a half ago <laughter>. Yeah, E I mean, that's so funny. E I mean, C and, C and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, F uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him C and, F uh, E I mean, C and he, they were really nice, C and, C but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know, C but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better. Yeah, yeah. <laughter>. My other son is just as happy as a bed bug. He, the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school. He's a classical guitarist C and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar, C but he decided he was going to go to the, F um the smaller now, and then graduate school later. D Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy, C and he's minoring in English, C and he had thought about economics, C and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't, He's, F um, he's going to be a junior. He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year C so he's double majoring. D Well, D you know, D see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, D you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two. Yeah. D Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college, this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage. D Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family. F Oh, good, that's wonderful. F Oh, that's great. That's right, that's exactly,
