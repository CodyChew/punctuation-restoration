Okay, you got any hobbies that you want to talk about? What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time? F Oh, really? <Laughter>. Did you have, F uh, your own business C or you do that as, just on the side, or what? Uhhuh. D Well. What do you teach? F Oh, that's good. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I, F uh, play trombone in the Plano Community Band. C And I, F uh, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike. D Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot. <Laughter>. No, just a crummy, D well, D actually the Lions are pretty good, A I'm afraid, they pro, a lot better team than the Cowboys were today. C And, F uh,. <Laughter>. F Oh, okay. I, I play that about six times a year C and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six C and I swear, swear that game off for another year, C but I always go back to it <laughter>. I understand that. D Well, you do lots of stuff. <Laughter>. Gosh, I come up there I'll have to stop by and have, try some of your baking. I call on people in. My business is, F uh, machine tool sales, C and I have some, I, I cover Texas and Oklahoma. C So, I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that. I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma and Eda and all that, all that way. Yes, yes. I, about thirtythree thousand miles a year. C So. <Laughter> D Well, I usually, D see, we, we have our, our band practice is on Monday night, C and during the summer we, F uh, we have concerts every Monday night in the park, C and, F uh, we, we have, D you know, some concerts during the year, C and, D you know, various people in the communities want us to play for things, C but those are usually on the weekend, C so that isn't too bad. D Well, we got, F uh, pretty good size band. Not everybody shows up, C but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred C but we only average about forty to fifty people a, D you know, usually. Yeah. F Oh, no, no. This is a, it's a concert band, C and, F uh, we have a lot of, I, I don't pretend to be that good, C but there's a lot of people that, F uh, D you know, are band directors at schools, or have been, C or, F uh, D you know, there some people that are actually music majors. They don't necessarily follow that any more, D you know, that isn't necessarily their career, C but, F uh, we have some extremely good talent in there, C and, F uh, as a rule, it sounds pretty decent, C so <laughter>. It's fun. <Laughter> D Well, I don't know if I have any or not. I, I've always enjoyed it. I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way. D Well, I, F uh, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to, C but, I guess I'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies. D Well, I sit and design cards C and, F uh, F oh, I, I'm really into graphics, C so, it, it just, I sit and learn new programs C and I play <laughter>, C and I do this, C and I do that C and, I'm, I'm starting a side business in desk top publishing C and, F uh, it's just getting going. I, I'm teaching in the daytime C and, F uh, I teach business and computer technology. D Well, I guess <laughter>. It's, F uh, to high school kids, it's, F uh, alternative learning C and, F uh, it's, it's really a challenge, C but. What hobbies do you have? F Ooh, neat. D Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did. F Oh, D well now, yes <laughter>. I don't think you can blame the weather on that. We had. On any given day, they say. F Uh, I haven't, I haven't played in a while, but I do, when I get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer I like to play golf. F Oh, I, F uh, F oh, I take spells, I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person <laughter> C and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand percent C and then I get, I get burned out on it. C But, F uh, I do some counted crossstitch and some painting on shirts. D Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done, C but I guess I do C and, I, I like to bake. It's just me in the house, C so, when I bake it's usually to take out for something. D Well. F Oh, okay. F Oh, how neat. C So you do quite a bit of traveling then. F Ooh, D well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies, does it? How big is your band? Ooh. D Well, that's still a pretty bi, good size band. It's not like there are four or five of you there. I, I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever, C and I'm always very envious of people who do. D Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,
