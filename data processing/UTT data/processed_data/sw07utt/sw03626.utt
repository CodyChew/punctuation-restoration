F Uh, let's see. Personal computers. D So, do you use them? Terrific. What kind? Mostly for word processing type things? Nice. Did you buy a program to handle menus? F Oh, yes. Eighty eightyeight is what you said? Eighty, F oh gosh, it's worth your time to just upgrade, they're so darned cheap now. Computers. F Oh, no. <Laughter> F Uh, I've, I've got one at home too. It's a three eightysix, thirtythree megahertz, forty, four meg ram and hundred and thirty meg drive and super V G A C and, D yeah, it's fun. I do programming, too. My job is, F uh, E D P auditor, C and so I'm into computers all the time. Electronic Data Processing. Yeah, I really enjoy it, C and it treats me well. F Uh, what are you studying in college computers? How nice. How they work is fascinating to me. Was it. Did, di, Hardware stuff, F huh. What do you think of that fuzzy logic? Uhhuh. Yeah, they're pretty amazing. F Uh, I've written a couple of programs for, commercially, F uh C and it's a fun field. What, no, in, F uh, no, just regular, F uh, C but you have to take into account, D you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider. Yeah, pushing keys certain times and, F Uh, messing up your files and things like that. C And you're going to be an engineer, computer engineer type. I don't, That's good, F uh, Yes. F Uh, yes, F um, we own one. F Uh, its an Emerson eighty eightysix, F um, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet. C But, F uh, D you know, it's, it comes in mighty handy. F Uh, yeah, a big chunk of it's word processing. We're also taking programming classes, C and, F uh, C so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it. C But, F uh, F uh, the, F uh, right now we got a project going where we're trying to put, F uh, all my wife's stray recipes on the disk. F Uh, it came with a menus program, C but, F uh, that doesn't, it, it basi, both, E excuse me, mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive C and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured. Eighty eightysix. Which, F Uh, impoverished college student. This one went on a credit card, C and we got a way out, while to pay it off yet. C So it's, F Oh, that's sounds nice. E D P. Okay, that sounds like fun job. Yes. F Uh. Computer engineering. D Well, computer engineering technology, F uh, which, F uh, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering. C But, I've got a ways to go yet. So far most of what I've done is getting, gotten core classes out of the way, taken some electronics classes, and one class in, F um, with computer logic. F Oh, yes. I enjoy it myself <laughter>. The, F uh, lab for that, F uh, computer logic class was a lot of fun. Yeah, we got to hook up a few, F uh, counters and, F uh, deco, encoders. Yeah. I've not had a chance to work with it, although, F um, my, F uh, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuz, fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it. D Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know, C but, F uh, it sounds like a very impressive piece of, piece of work. Yes. In the fuzzy logic direction? Yeah. Entering bad information of one sort or another C and, Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah, D well, what the computer, what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from, you get programming, a fair amount of programming, you get hardware, you get, F uh, more or less, F uh, you get basic electronics courses that, F uh, deal with, D you know, not only the digital circuitry but, F uh, D you know, power supplies and, and, F uh, just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, F uh, computer electronics. C So, the idea is that, F um, you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major, C but I sa, I have more with the hardware than I do with the software, C so, yeah I pretty much plan on, E I mean, so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction.
