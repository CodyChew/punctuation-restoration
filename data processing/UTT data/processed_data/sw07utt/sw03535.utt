Okay, where does she live? Rutherford. I don't know that. Uhhuh. It's, F oh, F oh, south and, okay, yeah, I know where you, I know the area. Right, that's kind of on the other side of town, C so our kids probably never went to school together or anything <laughter>. F Oh, D well, I've got one in college <laughter>. By now. Right. Whether it is possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not. What about you? <Laughter>. I don't either. I, I think, F uh, even if people have good intentions, I think <breathing> F uh, power corrupts or something <laughter> to a certain extent, D you know. Yeah, it seems like, F uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions, C but it's just so enticing, C and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know, D you know <laughter>. Oh. <Breathing>. Right. E I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions, you know what I mean? Little bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, D you know, bend the rules, use their power. C So maybe it's just man's nature <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. F Oh, wow. What were they doing taking some, F Oh, no <laughter>. F Oh, gosh. Yeah, right <laughter>. Right <laughter>. F Oh. F Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington, C but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records. In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained, C but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, D you know. Some of them weren't even in the same city. One of them had, had cancer and died C and <laughter> E I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think. I don't, I don't either. F Uh, to make it totally honest. F Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, F uh. However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, D you know, the the HUD mess or the S and L. We could almost not afford such terrible corruption. Right, right. I think that, F uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing, C and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that, C but, F uh, Right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's right, C but they stay there, Uhhuh. Right, C and this would be for the best for the nation overall. You're right, it's just a, I don't know. I guess that's where they stay in, F uh, in, they try to stay in office. C But they always please the money people too. They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run, for office again. C And, Uhhuh. <Laughter> That's true. D Boy, it is a big problem, C but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now, don't you? I know. It's really terrible. E I mean, there was a time, E I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman. I thought he was great <laughter>. F Oh, D you know, I had, some of them seemed like kind of, F uh, heroic people. <Laughter>. F Uh, on Rutherford. It's, F uh, corner of New York F uh, just west of Mayfield. F Uh. F Oh, okay. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, they're, they're little ones <laughter>. Oh. Let's see, we're on government, whether we think it's honest <laughter> or can be. I, I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is. The ultimate power, ultimately re, <laughter> corrupts. I don't know if, there is enough money that you could pay them just, D you know <breathing> X amount of money to keep them honest. I just, I just don't, F uh, Right. We had, F uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, F uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners C and there were several counties, F uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners C and, E I mean, it was to the point of not just losing their job, but going to jail. F Oh, they were taking kickbacks. Yeah <laughter>. Just a little here, a little there. Major amount here, a major amount there. C But I think there was something like, D you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail. F Uh, that's, that's small scale. I don't know, D you know, I really don't know what could be done. F Uh, That's right. The coverups and, I, F uh, I don't know. I just, F uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests. I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, D you know, F uh, on the side that, that, it seems that when they get up there it's, it's what, if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather, than this is the way my constituents want it. run, Maybe C and then you think, D well, if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home <laughter>. I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government. D Well <throat_clearing> I wonder if they really were, or if we just really didn't,
