F Uh, we are to discuss air pollution and, F uh, what we think the causes are. C And I probably would, F uh, target, F uh, industry as being number one polluter. D Well, vehicles C and, C and, yes. Right, C because, F uh, there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there, especially those, the big rigs like the busses and, F um, the big, F uh, eighteen wheelers and so forth. I think they would generate probably, F uh, one of them would probably generate enough for three cars. <Laughter>. C But that's not, C and I think it can be resolved if, F uh, if they really let go with, the technology that they have at, F uh, at their hand, C and they haven't released it yet. I think there's a lot of hold back, F uh, because, of, F uh, F oh, priorities that they have, D you know, C and, F uh, it's, You have some children. <Laughter>. F Oh, okay <laughter>. Do you have, do you watch children C or do you, Uhhuh. D Well, that's interesting. F Um, is there anything, <Laughter> D Well, temporarily they do. <Laughter> Then we get out of that phase, soon enough. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, sure. Uhhuh. D Well, I know, F uh, F uh, in Michigan, F uh, the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it, C and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air. C And, F um, of course, now, No, C and when they, C and you bury it C and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications. C And, F uh, C And it gets into, into people, D you know, which is, F uh, the, the most important, F um, resource that we have is people, C and they're, C and they're destroying us, they, really are. C So I think the cockroach will evolve, F uh, sa, safely <laughter>. So they say <laughter>. Yes, C but there's not enough. C And we need expert cooperation. Yeah. Education of the, Education of the people is primary, I would think. C And, F uh, C and we're hard to teach. We are hard to teach. Absolutely, yeah. Uhhuh. Absolutely, yes. F Uh, of course, F uh, we would like to see it accelerated because, F uh, of the critical nature of it. The, the learning of it and the, just to, F um, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, F um, motivate ourselves to, F um, F uh, do what is right for the atmosphere. F Um, I think we're all contributors. E I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor, to pollution, C so, we just <<faint>> F um. Uhhuh. D Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past. That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, and our, F um, <lipsmack> land, D you know, which, F uh, we get our nutrients from. D You know, E I mean, everything goes back to the land. C So <breathing> F um, it's just, F um, very critical, I think at this point to, F uh, get that through to the people and get us educated. Uhhuh. I, I don't know if they offer classes in, F uh, the, F uh, in the grade school, F uh, F uh, subjecting. In science, okay. What grade level would that be? Would that be, F um, perhaps, the first grade level, which would be, D Well, E I mean, are they starting, though, at, at, with the children that are so, their little minds are like sponges C and they can really <breathing>, F uh, relate to that. Target stores? F Oh, okay. Okay. F Oh, I see. <<Faint>> Uhhuh, help fight the pollution. F Oh, that's wonderful. D Well, I'm sure that, F uh, perhaps they're the leaders, D you know, C and other will, others will pick up on their example and carry it, F uh, further. D You know, C because, F uh, thoughts are, <<Faint>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Music>. Yeah, that's probably <child_talking> a major one. I think, F uh, individually, F uh, just by the vast number of people there are, there's I think cars are also a major contributor to it. <Child_talking>. Yeah, vehicles <child_talking>. <<Music gets louder>>. <Child_talking>. Huh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Noise> <laughter>. <Child_talking>. <<Faint and muffled, talking to child>>. Just a minute, I'm on the phone <music>. Uhhuh. <Child_talking>. Yeah. <Child_yelling>. D Well, it, <Child_yelling>. Yes <laughter>. I have, I have five in the kitchen at the moment. <<Talking to children.>> You need to shut the door, please. Shut the door right now. We have the air conditioner running. What do you need? <Music>. Hurry. I'm on the phone <child_talking>. Yes, you may. C And they keep turning the tape recorder up besides <laughter> <music>. <Child_yelling>. <Child_yelling> F Um, I have three of <child_laughing> my own C and I have, F uh, two that I'm tending for the summer. Off and on, C so, <Child_laughing>. They cause more noise pollution than air pollution <laughter>. That's right, that's right. Yeah. C But, F um, I think another, <child_yelling> you can tell when you go around cities, you can smell specific things from, <child_yelling> from, <child_yelling> specific industries. I remember being, I, I grew up in <child_talking> New Jersey C and, F uh, I can remember the smell of Newark <music> vividly <laughter>. <Laughter> C And it's the type of industry, D you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air. Yeah. D Well, people think you burn it, it's gone, C but it's not gone. <Music>. Uhhuh. Then it just gets into the soil and into the water <music>. Yeah. Yeah. We really have to do more, <Laughter>. I think we've got to do more with the recycling. That's, I'm, I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening. Yeah. D Well, it's a, we're getting, at least they're starting, D you know. C So at least they're moving that direction. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, it's going to, it's probably going to be a generation or two before, before it's really going, very well, because now the adults are more aware of it, C and the children are being taught in the schools more, it'll be, D you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right, education is a big thing D you know, C and as we educate them individually what they can do, <music> people become more aware of the things in industry too that, that are causing problems C and, C and I think that they'll grad, they'll work towards solving those problems more too. F Um, Uhhuh. Yeah. <Child_yelling>. <<Muffled talking to child>>. Just a minute and I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up in a minute, A honey, when I'm done <breathing>. Uhhuh <music>. Yeah. D Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem <music>. <Popping>. F Um, <Popping>. I think they teach it a lot in science <popping>. Yeah. I would think that that's where it would come through. I, I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades. Yeah. <Popping> I think they are starting probably in the first grade. They're, D you know, they're hearing somewhat about it. F Um, <popping> I know, F uh, Target has their program to make kids more aware of it C and, <Popping> Yeah. They've got, if you go in the entrance, they've got, F uh, stands usually where they have, F um, little, F uh, kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read C and <popping>, C and they can form a, <popping> a group to, F um, Yeah, yeah. C So, Yeah. D Well, I, I know it's har, it's a hard problem to solve because you, D you know, D like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing, C and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more, C and then there's the paper and plastic bag question.
