<Laughter>. F Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about music. C And, F uh, let me go ahead and push one here. <tone> F Uh, do you ha, are you a musician yourself? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Where, do you sing in, in a choir or a choral group? Uhhuh. What kind of singing do you like to do? Yeah, uhhuh. F Um, are you, F uh, are, are, have you, have you been singing a long time C or have you studied? Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, really? F Oh, great. Did, did you do that in, F uh, Texas, or somewhere else? Oh. Whereabouts? Uhhuh. F Oh, that's wonderful. F Um, D well, I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs, C and then I didn't sing in a choral group, F um, until after I was, F uh, married, C and I sang in a couple of, F uh, community choirs, and then <breathing> F um, waited for a while, C and now I've, for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here, in Texas. C And, F um, C so I, I enjoy, just the chorals singing a lot, as well. F Um, are you a soprano, alto, or, A soprano. Yeah, so am I. Do you, C and, F uh, what kind of music do you like to sing? F Um, you were saying you had classical training. Do you have a particular composer that you like or, a particular type? Uhhuh. I've been listening to, F um, some, F uh, some advertisements for MADAM BUTTERFLY, C and I'm wondering if you, if you have ever done anything like that, have you ever done any, F uh, if, if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY. Yes. Uhhuh, yes, uhhuh. F Um, MADAM BUTTERFLY was, F um, in Dallas, it's been two or three years ago now, C and then I went to see that, C and, it was really wonderful. It was particularly well, the acting was particularly nice, I thought, C and, F um, C so, it was quite popular. F Um, you don't play, F um, an instrument C so, F uh, F um, have you ever wanted to, D like guitar or piano or <laughter>, Yeah, yeah. That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, D you know, some other kind of instrument, I think piano is always good background, beginner. F Um, I played piano all through, D well, I guess from the time I was fi, five until I graduated from college, C and, F uh, C then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school, C so, F um, that was the instrument both of my children started on, C but neither of them stayed with it <laughter>. One of them, F um, turned into a violist, C and the other one is, the boy is, F um, guitar and, and percussion, C so. F Um, C but the, I, I think that the piano background is very, F um, useful, C and, F um, I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on. Uhhuh. Do you have any other kind of music that you like? Uhhuh. I have a, I used to work with a fellow who had, F um, although this was a computer company, he had his, F uh, P H D in musical, F uh, I guess it was in composition, D actually, from University of North Texas, C and, F uh, D yet when I would go into his, his office every now and then, you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio <music> <laughter>. It may be country, it might be classical, it might be rock, D you know it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music. C And that was, that was neat for, for me to hear that somebody is, Yeah, yeah. F Um, do you have any plans to, F uh, do anything with your music in the near future C or, Uhhuh. Yeah. I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing, I'm not sure where, you are in Texas, C but I do know that some communities have, F uh, community choruses C and, F uh, that's often a good way to get back into it again. F Um, it's not r, terribly demanding. You might have to audition, C but that probably wouldn't be a problem, C but, F um, <lipsmack> there usually, D you know, that they take tours and things like that C and you get to know D you know, people socially as well as, as in a musical setting, C so that's always fun. I think that's, D well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music, C but we've gotten to know each other quite well, F um, in, on a, a social level, C and, C and I think we sing better because of that. I think, D you know, I think we sing more like, F uh, people who trust each other <laughter>, which is really nice. D So, whereabouts in, Texas are you, if I could ask? Flower Mound, okay. D Well, I'm in Plano, C so, F um, we're just not too far apart, D actually. Uhhuh. It was funny, F um, <lipsmack> F uh, it's, D you know, I talk to people all over, F uh, Texas, F um, and only one person outside of the coun, F uh, of the state, C so I'm always asking where, where in the state, D you know, the person is from if they're in Texas. F Um, are, do you have a family? Uhhuh. I was wondering if your, if your spouse, C or if, D you know, if you had, F uh, other musical people in your family. F Uh, if you have other people in your family who are also musical. Uhhuh. Do you come by it naturally? Was your, were your parents that musical? Yeah, yeah. That often is the case, F um, the, D you know, it's, it, sometimes it will skip. Like my husband is not musical at all, C but his mother is very musical, C and, F um, C and his children are very musical, C so <laughter> you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes. C So, F um, D well, I'm not sure how long we've talked. I haven't paid, haven't been paying attention to the, to the clock. C But, F uh, I'll bet we've done, we've done at least five minutes. <Laughter> D Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, F uh, Becky, C and, F um, maybe we'll talk again. Uhhuh. Byebye. Uhhuh. Okay. F Uh, D well, I sing. I don't play an instrument. F Oh, not right now. <Talking> F Oh, pretty much anything. F Oh, yeah. A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs. C And I've had some classical vocal training. Uhhuh. No, I was in Europe. In, F uh, in Germany. F Oh, yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Soprano. F Oh, D well, as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi. <Noise>. No, no, I haven't done, <noise> F uh, I'd love to, C but, F um, that's, F uh, Puccini, I think, right? <Cough>. Uhhuh. Yeah. No. F Uh, I think it would be nice if I played the piano. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <Throat_clearing>. F Um, F oh, I like to listen to all different kinds of music. <Music>. Uhhuh. Yeah <noise>. There's, D you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like C but, D Well, <breathing> I have, I have D like, we, I wish I could C but I, I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree C or, F um <phone_ringing>, <Phone_ringing>. <Phone_ringing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. That's good. Uhhuh, yeah. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, I'm in Flower Mound. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's pretty close. Yeah. F Um, I'm married. <Noise> I'm sorry? F Oh, a little bit. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah, I think so. I think, Probably <laughter>. Okay. All right, thanks. Byebye.
