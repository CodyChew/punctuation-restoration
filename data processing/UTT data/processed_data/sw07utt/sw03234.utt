Carolyn, I have a little Schnauzer, little miniature Schnauzer. What do you have? You know, those make the best animals, F uh, pe, best pets. My, F uh, son has a, F uh, F oh, it's a real mixture, it's part, F uh, Doberman and part Husky <laughter>. <Laughter> Yes, C and they, gentlest dog you ever met, C and they got him from the, F uh, Humane Society here in Oklahoma City C and she's just turned out to be a jewel. My, my little <child_yelling> Schnauzer is, is my friend. She is so spoiled. She's a year and a half old now, C and being single, she's become very important in my life it's so nice to have, come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you. Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, it's a puppy, because I work C and I'm not home C and unfortunately she's not as well trained as, as I would like her to be C and I realize it's my fault, I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian, C but, F uh, It is, it is. She's, D you know, she's real good, I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything, C and, C and, not one mess does she make C and then we go outside, C and she'll stay outside for, F oh, thirty minutes to an hour, come inside and use the restroom. I just want to kill her <laughter> at those times. C But she's a doll, she's a love, she really is. D You know, I, I, we always had a pet when I was growing up, F oh always had a dog. My mother did not like cats. C So we always had a dog, C and, C and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet C and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog, I, F uh, in fact my children gave me this, this little puppy for Christmas. Yeah, I think so <laughter>. F Oh, my goodness. Two babies, huh. Oh. That, that is really probably bad timing. F Oh, yes, Do you and patience C and you have to, you really have to be, just like your children, when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent C and... Oh. D Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society <laughter>. F Oh, my. F Oh, Uhhuh. D Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet, C and this one is probably the best one that we have had. F Um, as I say, we got it from the Humane Society, C and, F uh, we had lost a pet, C and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost. It got out under the fence while we were on vacation, C and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it, C but, F uh, when we walked in to the, to the Humane Society, this little dog was, F uh, in the office and would sit up and beg, C and just, F oh, he was so cute, C and the kids just fell in love with it. We just couldn't leave without it. C But, it's, F um, whoever had it before must have trained it real well, because it's just, D you know, it's, F uh, a good house dog. I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly, F Um. Oh. F Um. Oh. About the only time we have, D well, I shouldn't say the only time, C but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night, C and, F uh, she usually stays inside at night. We try to take her out right before we go to sleep, C but, F uh, sometimes it doesn't work <laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. What a cute idea. D Well, we got one one year for Christmas, C and, F uh, I had a baby the next day C and, F uh, C so that one wasn't really well trained <laughter>. F Oh, I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time, C so, Yeah, I thin, it was, it really was. The older kids had wanted one, though, C and, D you know, we thought, D well that would be a fun time for them to have it, D you know, get it at Christmas time. It was a little Spitz, wi, a little white fluffy and, D you know, looked like it came right from the north pole, C and that was fun, C but, F um, I, I sure wasn't good at training it I think you have to have time, D you know to do those things. That's right.
