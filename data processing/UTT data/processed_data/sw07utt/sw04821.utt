<Noise> <children_talking> Okay. F Uh, let me see <laughter>. I've been sitting here awhile. I almost forgot the topic. C But, F uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television. I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends C and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader C or C but I, <whistling> I C and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, F uh, radio C so I get most of my news D like from documentaries like FORTYEIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, D you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing. <Whistling>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Are you in the car quite a bit C or, Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. F Uh, Yeah. I, I, I pretty much am C and I watch the news at least twice a day. C So, F uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children C and so <laughter> it seems as if I catch the news ris, right as it happens, D you know. There was the explosions and that kind of thing. My husband will say how did you know about that. Yes, it happened at such and such time <laughter>. C And that's so, that, that's different for me. C So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing. F Uh, no it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, D you know. It's just that, F uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred C and it happened C and, <Whistling>. Right, right. <Whistling>. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Huh. Right. Right. It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story. That kind of thing. C So. F Uh, Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah. C But I try and catch most of those programs <throat_clearing> on Wednesday's and Friday's C and if I miss them, I try <laughter>, D you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing, I try and tape them C and <sniffing> C so I can sit back and watch them. C And it's pretty interesting. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah. C Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things <laughter>. If I don't want any interruptions, D you know. That kind of thing. F Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night <laughter>. Unfortunately, C but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night. Uhhuh <noise> <children_talking>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well I get a, weekend paper as well C and, F uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly. I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee C and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local <laughter> stuff F uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week C and then I get the Sunday, F uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper. F Uh, mostly that's my difficulty. I, F uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R <swallowing> which has very good, A and that's National Public Radio which has very good, F uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well. No, I'm not D actually. F Uh, C but I can run my radio in my office. I, I teach at the university C and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station, C so. How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTYEIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely yo, noting of the events as they happen? Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage? <Noise> Uhhuh. D Well, I, myself, F uh, th, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do o, watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories F uh, is that quite often it seems to me <sigh> the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis. The local doesn't either C but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current. C And perhaps newspapers do that C but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper C and frankly when I have <laughter> read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either. C So. F Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too. C Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, D you know, how good is it. C But, F uh, I like a little more indepth coverage C and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTYEIGHT HOURS. Uhhuh. Yeah. I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that, D you know, there, that an event has occurred <laughter>. I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture. Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail. I don't know <laughter>. C So. When, you have young children, right? C So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption. F Oh, you do? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. When is your good watching time? Uhhuh. Yes. Yeah, that's what, I have older children and getting dinner on the table. I come from the east coast C and I was, <laughter> it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,
