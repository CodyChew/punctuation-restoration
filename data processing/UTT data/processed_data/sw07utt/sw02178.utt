Okay. F Oh, I hadn't seen that, C but I've heard that it's real good. Uhhuh. Oh <sigh>. Yeah. Oh <sigh>. D Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break C and we went to two movies. We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin <<pause>> Williams. C And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP. C And I really liked both of them. I really did. AWAKENING was, it was kind of sad to me. It really was, C and it would, it would be to anyone because, D you know, they really don't know that much about it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. C But the drugs didn't work for long, C and they started having real bad side effects. C And this is about nineteen sixtyfour, A I believe, or something like that, C and there still hasn't been any, D you know, new development in prescribed drugs that can help it. C But, yeah, there, D you know, it, it was a big breakthrough, C but in time, D you know, the, all the side effects started showing. Bad. Yeah, yeah. They was actually went back like they were, D you know, yeah. All it was, they wasn't mild, D you know, they was just bad side effects. C But I really enjoyed it, though. You know. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. That's strictly for entertainment <laughter>. That was just <laughter>, it was, Yeah. He sure is. He is, as a matter of fact, F um, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name? I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie, variety player more so than he is, because he really played the part good. D You know, he could be this rough, tough guy and then, D you know, this substitute teacher. It was really good. F Oh, I've seen that. Yes. It is, it is, isn't it? Yes, yes. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. I did too, I really did. I enjoy a lot of movies. Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't handle <chiming>. I'm not into that, D you know, I ju, like RAMBO and all that. I, that's just <<pause>> something I just don't want to watch. Oh. <Chiming>. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah, uhhuh. Oh. I guess I'm a little too scary <laughter> for that. F Oh, uhhuh. Yes, yes. Yes. It is, it really is, yes. watchi, yeah. Watching, yes, <talking> <<as if a scared child>> F oh, I don't want to go home, <<normal voice>> yes, yes <laughter>. F Oh, goodness. Yes. Oh. Yes, I know, F uh, I have two children. I really try to watch what they watch, I really do, because my youngest one, he watches something, you might as well just plan on staying up all night, because D you know <laughter>, He'll come in, Mama, I think the ghost is in the house, Mama, I hear it, don't you? They're eight and ten. C So they're, D you know, it's just a movie, D you know, I try to say, it's just a movie, C but no, Mama, I've seen it <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, Oh. Oh. Die, oh <laughter>. Oh <sigh>. It's funny how your little minds work, isn't it? Oh <laughter>. F Oh, I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars, people like us, D you know <laughter>. <Laughter> F Oh, goodness. D Well, D well I've enjoyed talking to you. C And maybe we'll run across each other again. Do you? D Well, as far as, we could not call in last week. D You know, from where I'm at. We couldn't call in. They said it would be up Friday, the, March the fifteenth before it was prepared. C So I missed several days, because I was getting quite a few calls. <Cough>. F Oh, uhhuh, oh. Yes. Oh. D Well, my husband, sometimes, D you know, he'll receive a call C and he's at work, C and, if I, D you know, if I know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as mine, C but the other day I got one about fishing C and I thought, F oh, my. I don't know a thing about fishing, C so I'm not even going to try <laughter>. C Because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time, believe me. Yeah, C but I'm really not for sure, though, if <laughter> D Well, I'll let you go, C and we'll talk to you later. Byebye. All right. Last thing I saw was, F um, I think, F uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts. My husband didn't like it that much. I thought it was okay. It was a little strange, D you know, this woman supposedly is, F um, being mentally abused by her husband, D you know, he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house, C and she figures out this way to, F um, to leave him secretly. D You know, she fakes her death kind of thing C and he tracks her down <laughter>. D So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, D you know, when she realizes he's in the house, D you know, after her, C but, F uh, kind of had the feeling along that, F uh, why didn't she just tell him to straighten up. <Laughter> D You know, why didn't she just tell hi, D Hey look bucko, you don't get away with this nonsense <laughter>. C But anyhow, F um, what have you seen? Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. C So this is where the people have been kind of <<pause>> W, I don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma, for a long time. C And the drugs let them come back. Oh <sigh>. F Um. D Well, how bad were the side effects? Oh. Oh <sigh>. F Um. F Um. F Um. D Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP? <Laughter>. D You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, F uh, a bit of a variety actor, D you know. At first he was just a big muscle man. C But he's kind of branching out. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Um. D Well, there was a movie out, it's been on cable, I get cable, C and there's this thing with, F uh, Danny De Vito called TWINS. I thought that was just great. I even like some, E I mean, some of the original stuff, D like I like THE TERMINATOR. At first, D you know, it was kind of strange, C but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. And, and some of the other things. F Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer. Guess it didn't last too long at the box office, C but I thought it was pretty good. C And, F Um. F Um. Yeah, yeah, C and I, I have some, one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks C and I just keep telling her, how can you do that? C And I told her when she had her, her little girl. I said, now you better get out of the habit of watching those. You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl, C and she says her little girl's into it now. C And she wat, she watches these really gross things D you know, like, THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, The, D you know, that kind of, junk. I don't go for that at all. I remember when I was real little, I, we all went to some kind of scary movie, C and it was like this ho, big house had a basement, C and there was all these weird things going on in the basement, D you know, C and I was scared to death of our house had a basement for years. You know, C and I got a lot of really weird ideas, from that goofy movie. D You know, they tell you that kids can, D you know, be impressed by all that stuff, C and it's true. I, I had a lot of things that I, I, nobody told me that it was all fake. I was just sitting there watching it, going <talking> <<like a scared child>> F Oh, jeez <laughter>. C But I think a lot of kids, A it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed. Where do we get that from? <Laughter>. F Um. How old are they? <Laughter>. F Oh, C but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, F uh, three kids, C and the little boy must have been, F oh, maybe about ten. C And we rented CHARLOTTE'S WEB Okay. C And he just bawled at the end and just <noise> <<imitating a crying child>> F uh, she's not going to die. C And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay, C and he didn't want to listen to it. He just was beside himself, D you know, this is supposed to be a nice children's movie, CHARLOTTE'S WEB He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah <<imitating a crying child>>. She's so nice, she can't die <laughter>. <Laughter> F Oh, it was jus, <Laughter> F Oh, You too. Yeah, this is kind of neat. I haven't ever initiated a call. I've just been called, D you know, by the switchboard, C and, F uh, D well, the first week, I think, a lot more people were doing it. C But I normally get a call D like every other day. F Um. Uhhuh. F Um. How weird. I don't know, C and they, they do have a variety of topics. My first one was the toughest, it was something like discuss pollution. <Laughter> It was discuss air pollution, causes of it and cures. I was going, F oh, D well <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. D Say, D well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water <laughter>. All right. Byebye.
