Okay, Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from D like mine. Right. F Oh, do you, yeah. F Oh, I'm sort of a, D well, I'm different from that. I'm sort of a, a movie buff. I go to <laughter> a couple of mov, movies a week, sometimes, C but honestly I'm, I'm selfemployed, C and a lot of times I will, F uh, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from D like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office. C But, F uh, I do it, it's like entertainment, C and I'm pretty much of a, a junk movie watcher by myself. If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, D you know. C But, F uh, C and my kids are all sort of movie watchers. D You know, we, we've always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life. C So, C but I would just as soon, F uh, be doing something else, it's just that my kids are gone now, C and, C and my wife's a school teacher C and sometimes, and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock. C So, D you know, I'll come in D like five thirty or six, C and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V C and sometimes I set there all evening. You bet, you bet. D Well, that's an interesting channel. That's great. D You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it C and, D you know I like my sports and everything C but I, <Laughter>. Watch my Dallas Cowboys. I watched them to halftime before I left C and I left at halftime C and started dri, driving. They sure did. They just did an excellent job. Yeah, the Eagles yeah luck into it now, I think. Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit. D Well. You bet, as much as everyone, D you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there. It was. I think so too. He wanted to go out a winner though. I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out F Oh, no, it's, D you know he earned his stripes. I know. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book C and I hope he's a winner in his own book, D you know because that's the key there. You bet. Little things that disturb me, C and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it C but, F uh, D you know, this ring of honor thing, D you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it. He deserves it, C and he was the Dallas Cowboys, C and he won't do that yet. C So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered. No, no, no. Absolutely not <laughter>. That's true, C but he needs to be honored, let's put it that way. You bet. I've been here since seventyfour, C and I feel like a native. F Oh, did you. Yeah. We came, we came down from New York state in seventyfour, and F uh, never had any regrets at all. You bet. It's been. It's a great place to raise our kids, C and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December she's getting married the month before in November, C so I will have finished, be finished <laughter> with that. Right. D Well, good. No, not at all. <Laughter>. D Well, I enjoy my T V programs. I like those, I like those detective programs. I like everything. I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, okay, F uh, most of, most of the, F uh, commercial television these days, I'm just a little bit sick of. F Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly any, F uh, television at all with, F uh, my other activities. F Uh, between my family and my church et cetera, et cetera, D well I don't have time, I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news. D Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen C but, F uh, aside from aside from that, I pretty well, F uh, turn it off. Uhhuh. I don't blame you. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah I, D well, it, sometimes if, if it's real good, D like there's more, there's been more than one evening that I've, F uh, caught, F uh, every animal show that evening on, F uh, on the Discover channel. C And, F uh, because they're, F uh, they're, they're, D you know, they're documentaries and they're. F Oh, you bet, in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, F uh, basic cable package. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh, me too. Hello <laughter>. D Well, they, they, who, they whooped up on them. Uhhuh, C and they're in the playoffs, C and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not. I did. Yeah, that's true. Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson, C but, F uh, he's, F uh, he's brought the pokes, F uh, from a, a one and something team to, F uh, playoffs, in what, three years now. Uhhuh, D well, it's, F uh, D you know, it was the time for the passing of the guard, E I mean. C And I think Tom knew it. C So, F uh, Yeah, that's true, C and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because yeah, C but, D see, nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too, he's too far, he's far too much of a gentleman and a, and a practicing Christian to, F uh to ever be thought of as anything but a lo, D you know, but a winner. Yeah. F Oh, he is, he is because he has to like himself before he can like other people. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, he will. Right. D Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry. Shoot, come now <laughter>. E I mean, I'd not a you betcha. I'm not a native Texan by birth C but, F uh, I guess if I, F uh, length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here twenty years you're considered native. D Well, let's see, I came down March of sixtynine, went to work for T and I. Yeah. C So, F uh, I haven't looked back yet either, C so <laughter>. Right. Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had C and then look at the weather we have down here. Huh <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, goodness. D Well, we're D well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him through his technical school C and, F uh, we're, F uh, he's over halfway, C so. D You know, <laughter> we're not staying on the topic of television shows, C but I'm really not too concerned, are you? No, me neither. I'm enjoying the chat. F Uh.
