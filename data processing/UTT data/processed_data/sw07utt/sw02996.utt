Yeah, F oh definitely <laughter>. Seems like, Yeah, I think that, F uh, we probably will have to have, have to, F uh, have a state income tax because, F uh, Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries, F uh, D well I, I, come here from New York C and New York had a state lottery, C and it really raised a lot of money for the, for the state. F Uh, although we, in New York we had to pay a state and a city, F uh, tax. C And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though. Right. It sure does ma, make a difference. Uhhuh. Do you live in Dallas? F Oh, you do? F Oh, I do too. Okay, C and then, you know too, that, F um, taxes are, are less, D like if you live in Mesquite. D You know, some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there, F uh, Uhhuh. Eight point five. Uhhuh. Is it the s, is it, F uh, less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, it sure did C and then once you could deduct at least some of that, F um, off, off your income tax C and you can't do that anymore. It really hit me yesterday, I had, F uh, air conditioning service for my car done. C And I had a little, little, F uh, coupon special that was twentytwo dollars for, F um, air conditioning service where they, F uh, checked it and ch, recharged it and put one, one pound of freon in C and if you needed another pound of freon they ga, it, it was D like seven dollars and something. C And then with the with the twentytwo dollars and the seven something, it all came out to, I, I ended up paying like thirtyfour dollars. C And I couldn't believe it and the tax, D you know, really hits you. Uhhuh. C And then, F Oh, it's been, I've been here for nine years. Really, where did you come from? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I did visit, F uh, Michigan, I visited Kalamazoo once. My sister used to live there. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's true, I tell you what hit me the first year I was here, F uh, Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open, the department stores wouldn't close, F uh, D well I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock, department stores, on Christmas eve. C But, F uh, there were stores that you could go to, F uh, D you know, like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to C and you could shop until D like twelve or one o'clock that night C and that was like, that was really the only night they were open that late, C but it was Christmas eve. C And when I came to Dallas, I thought I was going to do that Christmas eve C and I couldn't find hardly anything open, <Laughter> after five o'clock in the afternoon. An I was, F oh, I was, I really, I really was stuck <laughter>. C And I think Target was the one that stayed open later than any, anybody else. C And, F uh, I was able to pick up a few things in there, C but, D boy I was, I was really shocked. C And then another shock I had <laughter> D well, when I went to, F um, to buy a slice of pizza <laughter>, and found out that I had to buy the whole pie. Yeah, now, C but they, back then they didn't. When I first came, no. Anyway, <Laughter>. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and talk a talking about alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that, and the taxes on a package of, of cigarettes. I used to smoke, D you know C and, F uh, that would have been enough to, to make me, me give them up. The price of them now, C but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems. D Well, D Well they're like two, C or, I, I believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now. A little bit, a little bit more in some places. F Uh, D well, I believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton, I think it's maybe thirteen or something. F Um, C because I remember we went to, to Oklahoma to th, this bingo place. This Choctaw Bingo, F uh, a couple weeks ago C and somebody that went with me bought a carton for, F uh, ten dollars and something C and they really thought they were getting a big discount. D Well C because, it's, D you know, the Indians, I don't think they pay tax. In, in Oklahoma. C And, F uh, it was a Indian, D well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there. Although I didn't see very many Indian people in there <laughter>. There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's, it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth. <Sigh> I won a dollar <laughter>. Yeah, I had fun, F uh, a couple on the bus won some money. One, one guy won t, <Noise> <<rattling in background>> D Well I always think I'm paying too much taxes. How about you? <Laughter> Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet. E I mean, D you know, they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to, F uh, <sniffing> enact this I think, F uh, <sniffing> the, F um, other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling C so they keep trying to say we may need a, F uh, state income tax <sniffing>. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. Yeah, makes quite a bit of difference in your, F uh, D well your income level. D You know, C because other states quite a bi, a chunk out for, F uh, city and state taxes C so you're, F uh, looking at your yearly salary, it makes quite a difference. A little more take home here <sniffing>. Yeah, Richardson area. Yeah, I work at, D well mainly the Expressway Site is where I work <rattling> <<sounds like paper>>. F Oh, okay <sniffing>. <Sniffing> Yeah. C Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, F um, Dallas County area because, what do we pay, D like eight and a half percent, something like that for the, F uh, sales tax. Which, D yeah, that really is pretty high. I think so, although I really, I don't go up there too much, E I mean I, I normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall, or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience, C or <breathing>. I guess maybe if I was going to buy a car or something, maybe I would consider where I was buying it, to try to, D you know, save a little bit on that sales tax, because on a car that really mo, kind of mounts up <talking>. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Thumping>. Yeah, yeah that's true. Although I wi, I wish, D you know, overall they'd try the lottery again. When did you first come to Texas? <Dishes>. Okay, D well, that's about the same time as me, I came down in eightytwo. F Um, D well, Ohio, kind of. My parents live in Ohio. I had lived a little while in Michigan, C but, D you know, basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there <sniffing> F uh, more years than I ever did in Michigan. F Oh, okay <sniffing>. <Sniffing> C But D you know, when we first came down here, I really thought this place was somewhat backward, E I mean, I was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday. Remember that? <Sniffing> <dishes>. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Were you shocked like, F oh D no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. F Oh, few places now seem to do it by the slice C but, Right. D Well the, the, F uh, there was other things too, E I mean, I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here, to get them to, F uh, come to the, D you know, the correct decade here and century. F Um, I couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer, alcohol, whatever, in the car! <Talking> <<Background voice says, that's not the subject>> E I mean, you could always, F um, F uh, be careful about that back then because, F uh, D you know, if yo, if a cop stopped you then you would, F um, D you know, get arrested or what not. C And people would just drink openly. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. W, I don't smoke, C so I don't really know what the, taxes are and stuff on it. F Um. C So you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes. Huh. Gee. They're cheaper there? Oh! F Oh, I got you, okay. Uhhuh <rattling>. D Well how did you do? A dollar, F oh D well, C but you had fun playing, right.
