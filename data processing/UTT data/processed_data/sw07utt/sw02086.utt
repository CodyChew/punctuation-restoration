Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. That's very spicy, too. E I mean these bell peppers and curry. F Oh, that sounds really good. Huh. I guess it was, is this dinner time for you? All done in advance, yeah. That's F um, <throat_clearing> I, F uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook C but I was single until I was thirty C so I did cook a little, D you know. F Uh, C and I cook a little bit now. What I like to do mostly is stir fries C and my wife normally says, F oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight C and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok. C And we do a lot of, F um, stir fry vegetables. It's, it's called a stir fry pan C and it, C and it fits right on your, F uh, st, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric C so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does. C And, F um, normally what happ, what we do is, F um, just, D you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil C or some other type of oil than just regular oi, vegetable oil. C But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things. C And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, F um, green peppers, and, F um, maybe put in a little bit of, F um garlic and ginger, F uh, beforehand. That gives, F uh, F uh, F uh, spicier flavor C and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, F um, a little bit of, F uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce C and that sort of makes a, F uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables, I've used, you turn them over. A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not C but, F uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things, C so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian. C But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, F uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, F um, F oh, D gee, mushrooms. It's, it's a pretty big C and we put that over rice. F Oh, you don't <laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, D see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up. My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up. I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh C and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town. Yeah, recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato. Red meat and a potato. F Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables. D See, never, no vegetables in my family. Yeah, it was really funny. <Laughter> D Well that was a real farm. No, C but I, I've, I've heard stories F uh, I've heard stories. F Uh. F Oh, this is ter, you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner. That's right, you should be careful <laughter>. That's pretty funny. C But my dad used to tell stories, D you know, about the way they eat chickens C but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs, we, we bought everything in a grocery store. There was no, C but it was funny, D you know, it so, C but when we got married, D you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, D you know, a lot of changes. I think so too, C but we just went shopping C and we came back with, F uh, with, F uh, sweets, D you know, chocolate covered peanuts C and F uh, we came back with sweets. We didn't bring all the healthy food back too. Uhhuh, D well that's, that's supposed to be, F um, the trend of the future, but, F uh, the cut back. I, F uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian C and, F uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office C and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots. Yeah, that was a sweet C and I was like ugh. This is a sweet. F Oh it is, it's a candy, I'm like ugh, D you know, Indian candy is not very good. C But everything was, C and everything, you didn't notice it at first, C but everything was sort of hot. Everything had a little bit of curry in it. It was funny, even the sweets did. When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it C but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it. D You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor. Good, they didn't have, I didn't like her desserts very well, they were very, yogurt and carrots and pin, pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt. C And it wasn't very good. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well have we done our ten minutes. Something like that, I think we're, No, nor, normally they just come in C and they say you've overextended your, your conversation. F Oh, okay D well that's, you'll see it will normally, it will come on C and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to compl, fifteen seconds to complete it. C But, F uh, I've been cut off twice. C So I just thought, in fact I'm just also, I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, D you know, he has one of those alarms on his car, one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car C and it's going off. C So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing. Okay, D hey thanks so much. Uhhuh, C and you said this was your fi, D well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably. I, F uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday, maybe I talked to somebody that, F uh, I got them on, F uh, during the day. It was a housewife C and she was home with two kids. C And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, D you know, that they wanted something C and they were arguing back and forth C and she just kept talking the whole time, it was pretty funny. Okay. D Hey thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Okay, in order to make the, F uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, D you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides C and then you take it out of the fat C and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it <cough>. C And then you, you, F uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan C and you kind of clean it out C and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, F um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil. Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. C And then you, F uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, F uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. Stir it real, real well. Then you, F uh, pour that in there, D you know, to make the gravy. C And you let it come to a boil again C and then you let it simmer C and you add, F uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder. C And that's going to, it's going to be really good <laughter>. Yeah, it's, Right, C and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. F Uh, D well it will be in a little while, I'm trying to get it, get it ready early. Oh. Uhhuh. What kind of wok do you have, is it, is it a real Chinese wok. Uhhuh. I see. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash, I just don't like squash. I never did. <laughter> My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash C and she'd have squash and corn bread <laughter>. C And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something. C And I'd just be, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that sounds good. We, we were from North Carolina C and we had a garden C and my mother would, would, F uh, grow the squash C and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of, Right. Wow. You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens <laughter>. You ever seen anybody kill a chicken? C And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off. C And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub C and finally it dies down, you get just a little patter C and then it, <Laughter> Getting ready to eat chicken too. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well that's good. A lot of people are eating healthier now a days. Yeah. Ugh. Yeah, I'm trying to learn how to cook, F um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, D you know, maybe use honey or something. Yeah. Ugh. <Laughter>. F Uh, right. The spice, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well I might have liked some of that I, I like hot stuff, I really do. F Oh is it ten minutes. I don't know, do we get a signal. F Oh, D well this is my first one. F Oh wow. Uhhuh. Goodness. Uhhuh. D Well, okay. Yeah, thank you, it was nice talking with you. Yeah. Ugh. Yeah, kind of hard that way. Okay. All right, thank you, byebye.
