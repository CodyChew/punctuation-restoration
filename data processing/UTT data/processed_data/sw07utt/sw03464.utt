F Uh, which ones have you seen lately? THELMA AND LOUISE, Yeah. I haven't seen that. Is it good? Is it? Yeah, I, I'm not familiar. Which, which Billy Crystal movie? F Oh, CITY SLICKERS, That's a real good show. Yeah, it's great. F Uh, it says a lot about, F uh, F uh, D you know, I, I'm young, C but it says a lot about middle life D you know, C and, F uh, F uh, it's a really good show. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, <throat_clearing> yeah, I'm not too familiar with THELMA AND LOUISE. F Uh, <throat_clearing> F uh, F uh, recently I, I've seen, F uh, the FISHER KING. Have you seen that? It's a really good show. F Uh, has Jeff Bridges and, and, F uh, <lipsmack> Robin Williams. F Uh, really, really good. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, <throat_clearing> D well, I like to be entertained once in a while C but, I, I really enjoy watching a movie that, F uh, where they don't really try and attract the, D you know, the great audience, but rather put out a, a real good movie. F Uh, it always, my, my favorite movie of all time has been, F uh, F uh, THE MISSION. Did you ever see that? F Uh, it's a, a <throat_clearing>, I think it's put out by Landmark Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE. F Uh, it's a, it's a, has Robert DeNiro in it. F Uh, he plays one of the main characters C and, F uh, it's about, F uh, Jesuit community in, F uh, <lipsmack> at the Inca Falls in, in, F uh, South America, Northern Argentina. F Uh, really, really good show. Yeah, it's, it's something that, D you know, it's, it's really stirring. The cinematography is just beautiful C and really beautiful scenes and real good music. Oh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> I'm much the same way. I, I, I, I have a fiance C and, it, it gets very difficult to, F uh, F uh, Yeah, yeah. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, they are. Sometimes you're in the mood for it even. Uhhuh. I found when, when I get, when I get with my, F uh, old college buddy, we, we usually rent, F uh, good gladiator movie or two <breathing>. F Uh, I still enjoy watching those. You can't just watch them by yourself or else, it's not bearable. C But it's, it's fun to, F Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, <Laughter> The ones where they dub in, dub in the English. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. That's great. F Uh, F uh, on foreign films did, F uh, did you, did you watch, are you, F uh, fluent in another language C or, F Oh, you don't? I don't either. I, I feel foolish sometimes because I, I don't speak another language fluently C but I do enjoy watching D you know, subtitles. F Oh, I just sort of blanking tonight. I just got done saying I just saw one, F uh, fairly recently. F Uh, F oh, gosh, F oh, I know, F uh, F uh, the one with the two girls that take off from, F uh, F uh, a, across, across the country on a crime spree. THELMA AND LOUISE, yeah. Yeah, it really is, it's, it's interesting. F Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it. I was going to go see, F uh, the Billy Crystal movie, also, which was, I'm a little bit behind. I usually rent them <laughter>. F Oh, this is the, F uh, just the one, F oh, gosh, it was the, F uh, CITY SLICKERS, right. Have you seen that? Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I, I've heard lots of good things about it C and I would have, would have liked to have seen it, C but I was with my wife C and I figured she'd like THELMA AND LOUISE better C so, C And I'd heard it was really good, too C so, No. Okay. Uhhuh. Yeah, there's, there's been a, a fair number of, of pretty good movies out recently. E I mean it kind of runs in, <laughter> in batches, E I mean, for a while, sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just, A I don't even, D you know doesn't even sound like something I want to see. What, what kind of movies in general do you like to watch? Uhhuh. No, in fact, I'm not even familiar with it, I don't think. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh <<very faint>>. No, in fact, I, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I <laughter>, D Actually yeah, my wife's from down in that region around the s, the, called the, the Seven Missions which are, which are right down in this, where I'm sure where it was filmed at. C And, F uh, I'm sure that, that would make it worth, worth her watching. She, my, my, F uh, my movie watching has, has, severely, F uh, has, has changed a lot since I got married. Yeah, she, she likes, F uh, action movies and, F uh, and, and comedies C and so anything that's, has anything little, is a little, little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is is boring to her <laughter>. C And, C and so I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign films. I used to watch a lot of, sort of, the less, the less popular films. C And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own. Find something both of you will watch. She, it's funny because most women aren't really, she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of. Yeah, she really likes all these gory shoot them up films. Keep her on the edge of her seat. I'll watch them, D you know, they're kind of fun to watch in a way. <Laughter> C But, F uh, C so it, it, it varies, I don't seem to get, D you know, as much variety these days lately as I used to. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, yeah, on the other hand, D you know, given that my wife likes those, I, I, D say, I occasionally like to watch them C and, C and C so, F uh, D you know, C so it's, you can always count on her to watch something like that <noise>. C And she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that. D You know, which most, most women now <laughter> won't, they won't come within ten feet of, All the, all the ya <laughter>. All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air <laughter>. Acha!. I s, yeah, I speak several, F uh, C but, I, I don't mind watching subtitle movies. F Uh, No, I, I, Yeah. E I mean, for some people, that's just, D you know, that's out of the question, D you know. You give it subtitles, they won't watch,
