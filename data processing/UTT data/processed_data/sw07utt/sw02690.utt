What are your favorite programs? F Oh, how funny. <Laughter>. I've seen the sign that goes to there. I've, D well I think I've seen it in the distance. C But I have not even seen it. C And I have not seen the program. C So <laughter>, C And, C and, F uh, I know when we went to London, it was really funny. F Uh, people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the, the Texas, F uh, the, the cowboys and by that program. C And that's, that's the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas. C So, I, C and I, they asked me, F uh, several times, several times they ask me, why are there two bridges? C And I didn't know what they were talking about. It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts. Is that, that is right, isn't it? C Because they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas? Darned if I know <laughter>. I was blank looking, D you know. I felt really dumb. D Well, there's water in the Trinity. I thought it was to, going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity. F Oh, do they? F Uh. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. I think that is just a hoot. That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on. My husband likes to watch T V. It's on. I usually read and watch T V. C And usually I can handle both at the same time, D you know. Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going. C But that's one of the few that I just actually watch. C Because it's funny. I really enjoy that one. Now, we watch a lot of those. F Uh, C and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, F uh, recently about the Gettysburg Address. C And they wrapped a fictional story around it. C And I thought that was well done. C And, C and it, it caught my attention. I wound up watching the whole thing. F Uh, I guess the awards ceremonies, and there seems to be dozens of them per year. Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not <laughter>. C But they could take that whole collection C and it would disappear C and I'd never miss it for a minute. Especially the beauty pageants. I, I, particularly take issue with those. I, I really dislike those. D You know, my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys. C And now, we're out running around, C and if they're, if they're playing, he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is, C and he'll listen. C But, even I've said, D hey look, you're fascinated with this, you sit and listen to the Cowboys. Let me run in here, C and I'll do some things C and I'll come back C and you don't have to miss, he'll say, na, na, na. C And he doesn't, he doesn't watch it. He list, like I say, if it's convenient he'll listen to it. C But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to. F Uh. F Oh, those people. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, how neat. D Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans. C And, I, I, I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything C and, F uh, that was, that was a lot of fun. C But, I don't know, I haven't been as, I'll tell you what I love to watch. And this is not, this is rarely on television. C But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football. Yeah, I like it so much better than straight football. It, it doesn't, it has a lot of different rules. The field is half the size C and there's no, they can't call time and things like that. It moves a lot faster. F Uh, again I think it may be on cable more than anything else. We don't have cable. D Well, Oh. They're everywhere, they're on every corner. Everything you've ever wanted to see. D Well, C and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that. C Or it becomes snack time for various reasons. You can put, D you know, the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater. C Because I understand that, that your, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't. That's what I hear too. D Well, my husband smokes. He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes. C And you can't smoke in movie theaters. C And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies. C But I haven't really cared up until this point. C But I, we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES. It's, that's it. We will do it. C So, Yeah, finally. <Laughter>. D Well, I tend, my job tends to be very demanding. And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to, F Uh, it's kind of hard to put my finger on a, on a favorite T V program, C however, F uh, one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS. C And, F uh, <Laughter> C And, F uh, it's going to be going off the air, F uh, let's see, a week from Fri, a week from tonight. It's going to be its last show. C So I've, I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years. I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it. C And, F uh, I was, F uh, greatly disappointed, F uh, when I did move down to Plano to, F uh, find out that the, F uh, the, F uh, great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh D well, That's a shame. Uhhuh. Yes. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. D Well, it's, it's, F uh, when you look at the, F uh, D you know, route seventyfive, coming down there. E I mean, it's actually a bridge, C but it's a bridge over top of roadway. There's no water there. E I mean, F uh, Yeah. D Well there's, there, F uh, D well they, I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas. One from the east and one from the west. C And that's why. C But it kind of confuses people. C But, F uh, F uh, I enjoy, F uh, F uh, a lot of different comedies. F Um, I think it's mainly for an escape, F um, D you know, you, F uh, my job is not the most thrilling in the world C and, F uh, I enjoy laughing and, F uh, some of the shows that, F uh, are on the air, some are just purely, D you know, brain drainers. C And then there's other ones that, F uh, deal with, F uh, in a funny manner, F uh, socially relevant things. C And, F uh, one show that comes to mind is D like DESIGNING WOMEN. F Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. Yes. It, F uh, it has been very entertaining C and, C and also, F uh, the, the issues they deal with, F uh, really tends to open, open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems. C And, F uh, I've, I've really enjoyed that one since it came on. F Um, I don't like the politics surrounding the program though, C but, E I mean, other than that, D you know, there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses. C But, F uh, C and then, F uh, I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff, F uh, public, F uh, T V. F Uh, I like things like NOVA and, F uh, some of the, the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff. I just enjoy watching that stuff. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, F um, if ever watch one. F Uh, there's just not that much I'm, I'm interested in. F Um, for a while, I, I, I watched some football, C but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and, and watch a baseball game. Uhhuh. D Well I think it was great when they were, D you know, D like world champs and they were doing real well. I, F uh, I D personally, I, I came from the Washington area. C And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan. C And, F uh, when I came down to Dallas, it was, F uh, D you know, I found myself rooting for the home team. I, F uh, in fact I have a, F uh, a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys. F Oh, wow. Huh. Yeah. Huh. No, I haven't seen that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F uh. D Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime. It's, Yeah, that's probably true. Yeah, we don't either. I, F uh, I couldn't rationalize paying, D you know, it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them. C And if I, D you know, if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic, D well I can get that for free. C And D well, I really don't need C N N, I see enough bad news all the time. <laughter> I don't need to see more of it. C So I, I've kind of, F uh, rationalized that it's, it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see. C And of course when we were living in Texas, it was real convenient with Tom Thumb. D You know, having movies, F uh, back then it was ninetynine cents. E I mean, go, Yeah. F Um. You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. I do too. Yeah. C And I, F uh, I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it. She, she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty, <laughter> C and, F uh, D you know, she just doesn't like them. C And, F um, she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie. C And I've told her, D you know, everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick. C And, F uh, C so I'm, I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon. F Um. F Um. That's great. Yeah. C But as, as far as, F uh, regular T V shows, E I mean, I've got some, some shows that, that, that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched <laughter>. C And then there's, there's others that, F uh, F uh, I wish I had time to see. It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS. It's very funny. Some of the things in it are mindless, C but I, I just don't have time to watch it. F Um, I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night. C Because, F um, I work so hard over the weekend, doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday. Monday night I'm just worn out. C So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and, and look over things. C And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at, D you know, do, go through my mail and, and watch T V at the same time. Uhhuh.
