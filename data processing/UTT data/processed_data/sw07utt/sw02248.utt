All right. D Now, we used to be big time campers C but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports. D Well <breathing> when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, D you know, w, we went D like twenty or thirty at a time. We took, F uh, just our little tents, C and we did it that way. Then when we started having children we bought a camper. D You know, C and we did it that way. C So, we've always enjoyed camping. Uhhuh. Ye, yes. Now we have friends with a van, C and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, D you know. D Like one night C and the next night they'll stay at the motel, D you know, or something like that. C And they enjoy it. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, me either. I hate to be on all that stuff <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Oh. Yes, yes. Oh. C But D now, I enjoy it every once in a while, E I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often. I'm a sissy. I either want to do it in the fall or spring. You know? Yes. D Well, not really because usually it's when we go off, D you know, D like for a couple weeks or so. It's usually like that. Just about. Just about. F Oh, it really is. It really is. Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family. It's a lot easier then. F Oh, uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Oh. I'd like to go anywhere. D You know, I just like to go. I really do. No, not really, not that much. F Um, we've been, D well, we've been to Wyoming, D you know, and Kentucky and Montana and, D you know, places like that. C But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long. D You know, D like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on. C But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston. D You know <laughter>. Yes, yes. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It is. My children really enjoys it. They really do. C But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, D you know, C and it's so hot. C And our camper do, doesn't have an air conditioner. Yeah, it's one of those popups. I'm sure you could put one in probably, C but we hadn't did that. Yes, we all enjoy camping. C And they're, D you know, they're in D like and scouts and stuff like that, D you know, so, they get to go camping in those organizations also. At least their Daddy goes with them, I don't, when they do that. C But, That really is. D Well, how old is your boys, your children? Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Yeah. Yes. It really is. Mine's eleven and eight. C So, they really enjoy it too. <Laughter> Yeah, yes. Yes. Oh. C But I have, F uh, brotherinlaw and a sister, D you know, that just really just camp. D You know, they love to go camping. They could, they would all the time they wanted, D you know, wanted to because there's nothing holding them back. C But I'm just not that involved in it. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Me, I haven't really as far as entertainment, I don't know what you would do every <laughter>, D you know. C But I guess, my entertainment's, television, I guess <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, I don't either <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yes. C But they probably live in a city also, don't they? D Well, D see, we're in a real small county area, C and, D you know, that makes a big difference. C Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, D you know <laughter>. That makes a difference. It was nice talking to you too, C and we'll probably be talking to you again. Oka, okay, byebye. Uhhuh. What type of camping did you do? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, how neat. Uhhuh. D Well, I know I have, F um, I just have a tent, C and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent. C And then I bought a van C and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes, I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, D you know, when it comes, to camping. All the bugs and stuff <laughter>. C But I, I try <laughter>. C But, C but I try, D you know, to, F uh, to get out there and enjoy everything. C But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends C and he got poison ivy, C and it's all over him. The poor thing, D you know, C so, there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at <laughter>. F Oh, shoot. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Right. Definitely when it's cool. D Well, have you done much camping around Texas? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, have you camped all over the United States? Wow. D See now I haven't so that, I bet you that's an experience there. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, right. D Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot, C and they, F uh, they've been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama. And, F uh, which is really, really neat. They said they've got the white beaches and the sand, C and it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean. C And, F uh, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and, and those parts, in the mountains? Uhhuh. Right, right. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, rent a beach house or something, D yeah, that's, that's my idea of camping. C But we're, F uh, we're getting more into it C and we've done, F uh, we've done quite a bit C and, F uh, F uh, the kids like to go out, D you know, as often as they can. F Um, C so that's good. D You know, they're, they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping. Right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, D well, that's really neat. D Well, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, that's neat. That's really neat. D Well, I, D well, I have, F um, a son that's, F uh, going to be eleven here pretty soon, and then a daughter that's thirteen. C So, they're, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and, cooking and, and all that kind of stuff too. C So, that's, that's really neat. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I, I agree with you. They like to get out there C and, C but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to, to get out there C and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy C and it got all into his eye C and it was really swollen C and, F uh, C so they had to give him shots and everything, C so. <breathing>, F oh, D well, maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular <laughter>, trees, or what, bushes, whatever they are <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, now I like to go out D like several times a year. But not on a, on the regular basis. I have some friends who go out every single weekend, when, D you know, in the season. F Uh, C and, C and I just couldn't do that, D you know. Yeah, yeah. Just getting away. Yeah, right, right, see, I see, they just want to get away. C But every Friday night they'll go home, D you know, straight from work C and they'll pack up C and, D you know, C and then they'll leave, C and I'm just going, D you know, by Friday night I just want to crash, D you know, C and I want to go home and, D you know, do all that, and then, F uh, get out on the road to boot, C so. C But anyway that's their life <laughter>. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. Now that's true. That's true. Yeah <laughter>. That's true. D Well, it was nice talking with you. Okay. Okay, D well, take care. Byebye.
