F Oh, D so what would be the, your favorite meal to cook? Don't like to cook, huh? Make a mean spaghetti, huh? F Uh, got kids? M, married? Yeah. D Well, uh, my wife and I and we've got a thirteen week old baby C so don't do much cooking for him yet. F Uh, F Uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party C and, F uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that. Let's see, a good dinner party menu. I suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, I guess. D You know, F uh, something light and easy. If it was pretty in, informal about anything. Breast of chicken <<faint>>. F Oh, gosh, yeah. How do you usually cook your deer? How do you usually cook your deer? Yeah. Yeah. I imagine. I would imagine it is. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. We just had, F uh, deer stew sort of F uh, it was deer steak stew. F Uh, D well <noise>, about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, F uh F uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy. F Uh, some veggies in it. Delic, No. No, the times I've been out deer hunting, I, I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa. E I mean, I get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon C and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. C So, no, this was given to us by some friends. F Uh, guy was in a, F uh, in a hunting club C and, D you know, C but the whole group goes out hunting C and then at the end of the day, they split it C and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share C and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group. D Well, he wou, they, they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit C so there's, everybody had deer coming out their ears. C So, Yeah, they, they gave us some deer C and some of it's still in the freezer C and they, about eight months ago <laughter> they gave it to us. We, we either crock pot deer C or we'll, F uh, D you know, put it out on the grill so that, F uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it. Yeah. Yeah. That is good. Deer spaghetti is real good. Anyway, F uh, no, I think if I was going to have a dinner party, I'd probably have, F uh, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, F uh, F uh, D you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, Or maybe have something roasting out on the fire. F Oh, D well, anyway. F Uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining. Usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner. Let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over. F Ah, yeah, we had a, F uh, a turkey loaf. Which, F uh, kind of taco turkey loaf. It was good. F Uh, scalloped potatoes. No, mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes with, F uh, m, cheese melted over the top of them. A couple things like that. It was pretty good little dinner. Yeah, usually it's k, F Oh, don't you hate that?
