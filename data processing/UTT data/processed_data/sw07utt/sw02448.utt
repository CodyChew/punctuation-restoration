D Okay Charles, F uh, gun control, what are you, F uh, for, in favor or no comment? F Oh, you are? D Well, this should be very interesting, because I'm against it. D Well, D you know, F uh, now he, here's something that, F uh, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, F uh, weapons. F Uh, now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons. C And, yet, their, F uh, the gun control enthusiasts are, are, F uh, preaching about the gun control and how they should be, we should have stronger laws and what not. I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have. Now this is not just a state law, this is a federal law, controlled by the Treasury Department. F Uh, for fully automatic weapons. C And, F uh, D all right, now for instance, in California where they passed the F uh, F uh, semiautomatic C or, C or, F uh, now what was it they called them? The military version, attack weapons, or something? F Uh, h, how is that going to affect the, F uh, sports weapons? E I mean, rifles, that are automatic or semiautomatic? Uhhuh, D well, now, F uh, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there F uh, even though I am a member of the N R A, C and they are again, they, their reason being that D well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another, and so forth and so on. C And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way. F Uh, That, that's true. F Uh, now did you hear about the, the control that they have up in Virginia? F Uh, it, it's, it's a little hard to believe, C but they can, F uh, of course, like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law. Anyone ever convicted of a, a felony is, cannot purchase a weapon. <Breathing> C and they don't have a waiting period, <breathing> because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons. C And the, F uh, when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in, F uh, F uh, Virginia, <breathing> the salesman just calls some number and, F uh, punches in your name, <breathing> C and if it comes up negative, okay, fine, C and you get your gwu, your gun right then and there. F Uh, C but they are the only state that does it. C And, F uh, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much. <Breathing> C and D frankly, I, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway. F Uh, F uh, at least F uh, records of, of, F uh, known felons which are available to local police departments. F Uh, F uh, F uh, certainly those, those records are available, C and all they would have to do is expand it. To, F uh, F uh, D well, connect them into a modem somehow. Well, Virginia is not a particularly rich state, C and they managed to fi, squeak out a few bucks to do it. C And, F uh, it's, F uh, F uh, onehundred percent successful. Yeah, I just heard about this last week. F Uh, they were bragging about it, with, F uh, F uh, they should have, have pride in this because it's, it's a good system, C and it's working well. C And they don't need that sevenday waiting period. C Because the whole idea of that waiting period was, so that, F uh, it, <breathing> F uh, the police could check up on you. <Breathing> D Well, you know what's going to happen there, those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work. <Laughter> that's another, F uh, F uh, thorn in my side, bureaucratics, politicians. C So D anyway D well, we seem to be one in favor and one against. Although neither one of us are, are, F uh, really F uh, F uh, dyed in the wool. F Uh, we, C but we both, <Breathing> D well, there should be some way of checking, now here in, in Texas, F uh, all you need is a driver's license. C And, F uh, even felons can still get a driver's license. C So I, I don't think they are too, D well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas. C But don't tell the N R A I said that. They're liable to tear up my membership. You say you retired a year ago? I'm looking forward to it in about a, just, just over a year, myself. F Uh, Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I bought a motor home here f, four years ago C and I have been living in it ever since, C and I'm looking forward to just traveling. I have four sons scattered all over the country, and a f, few grandchildren. C And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them. <Breathing> D Well Charles, good luck to you on your, <Breathing>. Yeah, nice talking to you, too. Take care now. Bye. I'm very much in favor of gun control. Yes I am. <Laughter>. I don't, I don't mind people owning guns, I just think it should be a little, D you know, a little, a little more regulated. Yes. I believe that's correct, uhhuh. Uhhuh. That would certainly help, I'm sure. Uhhuh. Yep. Uhhuh. <Breathing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, right, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yep. I really don't have any problem, Jack, with, D you know, F uh, people using firearms for sporting purposes. I don't have any problem, the only thing I, I am in favor of the sevenday waiting period. I would like to see that, see that happen. I, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I understand that. Uhhuh, that's true. I, I, like I say, I don't have any problem with people using firearms, D you know, for sporting purposes or hunting purposes, I just think it's just may be a little too easy D you know, to acquire one. On, on a whim of some sort. I'm not sure I have. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see. F Hm, that's interesting. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, you would think they would. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. Yeah, I'm surprised that more states doesn't do that. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. I wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do. Yep, right. F Hm, that's interesting. Uhhuh. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree. Uhhuh. <Breathing>. Yep. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. I agree. Yep, right. I was, just thinking there's, <Laughter> yeah, I guess that's about right, <Laughter> F Uh, Yeah, I'm not totally rigid on the subject, I just think there should be, D you know, shouldn't be quite so easy to do. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Sure, F uh, Yeah, that's true. I wo, I promise. I won't <laughter>. <Laughter> Okay, I promise <laughter>. Yes, I did, uhhuh. Yeah, I really enjoy it. I stay pretty busy. I do quite a, not quite a lot, I do some, F uh, volunteer work here in Plano. I, I have a few, F uh, handicapped persons that I, D you know, try to do things for, help them do. Uhhuh. That's, F uh, Sure, I can understand that. Uhhuh. Yep. That'd be neat. Sure would. Okay. Nice talking to you. Okay. Take care. Byebye.
