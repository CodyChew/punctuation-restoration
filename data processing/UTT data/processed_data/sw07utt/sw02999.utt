Okay. Yeah, we, D well, we have quite a few C but we don't really use them a lot. We have, D well, we like a lot of gasoline credit cards, because we like to be able to stop, D you know, when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station, C but as far as like MasterCard and Visa, we don't use those too often. What about you? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, really? Huh. F Oh, is it like an automatic debit C or s, F Oh, huh. F Oh, really? Yeah. We use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase, C but we always have the money set aside already to, C and then we just pay it off the next, month. We never pay, we don't like to pay interest on the <laughter> credit cards at all. <Laughter> Yeah. Gosh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, that, yeah, we, we screwed up one time like that too. We mailed it C and they just never did get it, C and we had to finally mail them another check. Huh. Yeah, I don't either. No, you figure, you'll get your check back if you have to. Yeah. <Laughter> Really. I like to use my card if I buy something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state, D you know, where if something is wrong, you don't want to end up having to pay for it. A couple times I've had to write big credit card companies and say, D you know, I didn't really get this C or I don't know what this is. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. Yes, it's, i, w, yeah, if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of, Yeah. <Breathing> I'm like you, too, about the yearly fees. I don't, F uh, I don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card. Right now both the MasterCard and the Visa, we don't have to pay a yearly fee on C and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate, is too, just as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee. D Now we had American Express cards C and my husband had always had that before we got married, C and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was D like ninety dollars <laughter> or something I think, I can't remember C but we decided let that one go C and, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But, yeah, like you said, if you really, if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it. Uhhuh. Oh. <Laughter> Yeah, that wouldn't be too hard to do <laughter>. Yeah. Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to, be stuck with that? We've never had, that problem either. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Right. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something. Lot of places have tho, I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute, you charge it. Yeah. Oh. F Oh, gosh. Yeah, that's nice. Right. Yeah, I like that feature C and the insur, D like if you break it yourself even, D you know, if you buy something that's breakable. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? F Oh, I didn't know that. Hi. Do you have lots of credit cards <laughter>? Uhhuh. <TV> F Um, I used to have a ton of gas credit cards, C and now I have one or two of them, C but I think I've even let some of them expire. C But I was living out of the country for a while C so I wasn't using them too much C and I don't drive that much. C But I have, D you know, MasterCard and Visa as you know, I have a MasterCard and an American Express now. I got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million <laughter> cards. C But, as long as, D like my MasterCard is, F um, free as long as you spend about, A I don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that. C And so, I tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card, when I have the choice. C And, F um, I used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff. The stores around here don't let you do it too much. C And so I don't. C But I was living in France C and there you pay for everything by credit card, C but it's not really a credit card <baby_crying>. It's a, it's a debit card, yeah. C And, F um, just, D you know, it's sha, many times <baby> you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash. <<Talks to person in background>> Bye, thanks. F Um, yeah. C Because they're just so well set up with it <laughter>. <TV> Right, D well, Yeah, I, I never pay finance charges on them except when I screw up which I occasionally <laughter> do. C And, D you know, I'll forget to pay the bill by the due date, C or this last month I mailed a check to them on the twentysecond C and they didn't get it until the thirtieth, C and it was, due the twentyfifth. C And D you know, C so I thought I, C and so I got hit up with a cre, F uh, finance charge on it which pissed me off because, F um, D you know, I really did mail it in time. C But they have no proof of that. I don't, I don't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it, C but I, I never, F um, usually never pay <laughter> finance charges. I had that hassle one time C and I, that went on for months and months and months because, C and they eventually found the check and deposited it C and months later they were still telling me that I owed them finance charges and, F um, late fees and things like that. C And I said, D well, I mailed you a check C and you eventually did deposit it. C So, D you know, I guess I don't know who the, the burden of proof is on. D You know, kind of the, C because you never d, when I pay bills I don't make a Xerox copy of it C or I don't F um, Right. C Or I don't get a, I don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever I, D you know, at the bank to have a proof of when I mailed it. C And, E I mean you can't do that, it would be ridiculous. Right. D Well, you can, Right. C Or I returned it C so don't charge it, yeah. D Well, that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer, C and the computer, F um, d, wasn't, didn't do what these people said it would do. We need to just put external cards in C and it wouldn't do that C so he brought it back to them, C and they're supposed to modify it. C And so I called the credit card company and said, D well, we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us. We can't use it. C And then they said, D well then don't pay it. C And then a month later, I had to dispute it in writing, C and I was out of the country and got back, C and I took care of it as soo, as soon as we got the computer back C and it was okay. I mailed off a check C but then it was too late. C So now they're hitting me up there <laughter> with a finance charge. C But it's sort of, D you know, it's, it's half our fault. C And so w, Right, if I had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually, it would have been okay. C So I learned that for the next time. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right, yeah. Yeah. D Well, my husband and I both have that C and I don't know what we pay for his card, I pay I think, I have a gold one C so, I think it's like seventyfive dollars for me C and I'm not quite sure what it is for him. C But I had really like w, there <lipsmack> nowadays I'm not su, so sure that it's worth it, C but, F um, in the past there, D you know, there are some places that only take American Express C and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card, if my husband and I both travel, it, D you know, a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card. C And, F um, with the American Express they say there is no limit. There really is C but they, tell you that, C but then that was one advantage C but th, that's like, I don't, I think it's seventyfive dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot. Be n, Yeah, D well, we should probably get another, F um, Visa card, ye, one, another one that's free. C Because there are some, D like I think A T and T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year. D Well C so, Yeah, C and so that's easy enough to do, C and if that's true, that's, F um, it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit. And get rid of the American Express because it costs so much. No. No. I, C and I don't under, E I mean, I guess I do understand the mentality of people doing it C but I don't understand. Yea, C because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay. I have had months where I was shocked at how much had come in because D like I thought I would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process C and sometimes it comes in right away C and it's like, F oh, D well, guess, I have to pay that too. C Because D like many times I'll tr, I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking, hey, I won't get that bill until the next bill, not this bill. C And it will come in on the next one, you have to pay for it right away anyway. C But sometimes the is long. D Like I've had things that I didn't get billed on for two or three months. Yeah. Immediately. Yeah, C but, that's what happened with us D like we bought a washing machine seven months ago, C and that I got billed D like the next day <laughter>. It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check C but we prefer g, D like with the credit card you get the automatic, F um, one year guarantee so if something breaks, things like that. You can, F uh, return it so D like the washing machine we bought it in October C and, D you know, if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee. C And somethings like that are, Right. C Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be C and C so, C so that's, D you know, another advantage. C And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, F um, you, hopefully you never use. C But like if your bagga, C but things like if your baggage gets lost, you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that. C And yeah, when you rent a car, you get that C and sometimes you get discounts with the cards C and so...
