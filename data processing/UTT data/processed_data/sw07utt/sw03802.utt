Mike, I'm calling from Dallas, from Richardson. Okay, D well, good. D You know, our subject is on boating and sailing C and, quite honestly, with the exception <laughter> of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat, I have never really got into sailing or boating. F Oh, do you, D well, great. <Laughter>. D Well, that's neat. <Throat_clearing>. Right. I've seen some nice, nice sailboats. The guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago, or whatever, he had a sailboat, used to park it right in the, F uh, driveway C and it seemed, F uh, I think it held probably, F uh, it must have slept four people anyway. Right. <Laughter>. I I understand. I tell you, F Oh, they are, C and, D you know, we have a swimming pool at our house C and I think of all the time, now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever, that I put in there, I just could not imagine a boat because I know it's a lot of maintenance. F Oh, gosh yeah. You bet. <Throat_clearing>. Sure. You bet. I know, my wife and I were first married here aunt and uncle, un, aunt and uncle up in New York, they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay C and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft C and we were involved every weekend in just, F uh, as we visited, we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that. We just worked all the time. C But their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen. It was sort of neat. We, C but I think that was the last time we were really involved, C and that was twenty years ago, or twentyfive years ago. It is a lot of fun. You bet. I visited my cousin a couple of years ago, my wife and I C and our daughter and he had a place on Lake of the Ozarks C and he had a boat C and, F uh, <sneezing> <<in the background>> I never seen so many boats in all my life. People actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying, townhouse or condominium, whatever they own C and they, they go boat. E I mean they go, if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail, they use the boat. C And that was sort of neat. That, that, that's true, that's exactly how they do it. They go to dinner that way, go to all the restaurants C and that was sort of a neat setup. I enjoyed that. We spent a week with them. I enjoyed that. I'm envious, I'm envious of people that have the big boats C and, F uh, You bet. <Laughter>. Think, you <ringing> think you'd really enjoy it? Yeah. F Oh I, <Noise>. <Squeak>. Yeah, that's great. <Laughter>. F Oh, I know. <Laughter>. C And putt putt. <Laughter> Sure. D Well, that's neat. Where do you work? Who are you with? D Well, good. F Oh, okay, great. I'm in Addison here. Right. I do, F uh, quite a bit of sailing. I own a sailboat that I keep it parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop <breathing>, C and we take it out C and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts, C but <Inhaling> I haven't really been taking it out, recreationally too much lately <laughter>. It's just I don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore C so it's hard for me to get it somewhere C but, Yeah, this one is not that big. It's a day sailer. It does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in C but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole, <Laughter> back into the main part of the sailboat. C But, C but it's, they're, they can be black holes to throw money into <laughter>. Boats are kind of expensive to maintain. Especially a bigger one. The bigger they are, if you get a big cabin cruiser or or a big ski boat, power boat, then there's always, F uh, stuff to go wrong with it. A sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up, C but you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging, F uh, everything that's in it. It takes a, <lipsmack> a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up C but, D Well it's a lot of fun, I think F uh, just from the standpoint of <inhaling> getting away from the dodge here, C and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long, a boat can be a lot of relaxation, F uh, to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever, F uh, or a cabin or something, depending on how much you like to rough it. C But, C but it's, F uh <lipsmack>, Use the boat for transportation. They just go across the boat and get a, and tie it up and go in, huh <laughter>. That would be fun. <Inhaling> I've just never <breathing>, I've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat. F Uh, once I get my son into and through with college, he's going to be starting, F uh, Rice next year C so he's going off, C but F uh, once I get to that stage where I'm not paying for something else and, F uh, I don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things, where I've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it, F uh, I might do something differently. I might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them, keep it and maybe consider getting a, a better one for me. F Uh, Yeah, I think I would. F Uh, the sailing part of it I like because it's so quiet. C And if you get a big enough one, then you've got a little motor on it also, where if it's light wind, you can still putt around a little bit and have fun. C Or if, C or if the wind dies, you're not stuck in the, middle of the lake. I've, with my little one, I've been out there many times on a calm summer day, where all of a sudden the wind stops C and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in C and C and that gets hot and, and wearisome, doing that. C And if you h, if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there, at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in <laughter>. <Lipsmack> C But it's fun. I own an insurance agency, a managing general, a wholesaler of insurance, F uh out in Addison C and, F uh, I'm a scout leader, though, C so I'm, I'm out with,
