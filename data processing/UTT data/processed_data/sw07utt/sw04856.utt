<Child_crying> F Uh, in Texas they do have the, F uh, capital punishment C and, F uh, I, I ju, I, I'm probably one that has to agree with it too. F Uh, there a, some things that go on that I just feel that I, I, just feel, that, that, <noise> that is a need. I don't know. A lot of people don't feel that way either C but I just feel that <static>, Uhhuh. <Talking>. Uhhuh <child_talking>. Yeah. Yeah, that is a consequence, yeah. <Child_yelling>. <Static>. Right. Right. Uhhuh. D Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on. C But I, I just feel that, that capital punishment needs to stay within the system. Not all states have them C but I, <inhaling> D you know, was that, was that the, I'm not sure if that was in, was that the man that, that claimed he was abused C or, C And that he had he, F Oh, yeah. Yeah. <Ringing>. Yeah. C And how long had he been a, appealing <rustling>? How long was that? Gosh. <static> Boy. Yeah <child_talking>. Boy. D Well, E I mean C and it seems like it, it rarely does happen. D You know, it's not, it's not used that often D you know. At least here in Texas C but I think it's something that needs to stay. I really do <<faint>>. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. My sister and I were wondering about this recently because a, an old friend of ours in California, this happened about a week ago. F Uh, her husband just killed her C and we're wondering if that has an effect. If that, if something, does capital punishment, D you know, does it happen with that, within that, F uh, I don't know <laughter>. Right. I think you're right. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. C And, F uh, I have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people <child_crying>, <Talking> D Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state C but California we just put somebody to death F uh, for, I think it was a double murder. F Uh, to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, F uh, to the details of it. F Uh, C but it had a lot of controversy out here. F Uh, basically, because in California people like to protest about everything. F Uh, C but I agree, I believe that, that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go. F Uh, the big disagreement I have is that <swallowing> in California, the appeals process, F uh, is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in D like ten to fifteen years before you can actually, D you know, put somebody to death for, for a crime. C And, E I mean, that's, that's ridiculous. E I mean if you can, D you know, y, y, the trial is supposed to prove, D you know, within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty, C and then they have appeals. D Well, that's fine C but it shouldn't take more, than a few years. E I mean, I should think two or three years maximum, you should be able to know C and you should be able to either put the guy to death C or he's innocent. E I mean it's, if he's guilty for, for, D you know, multiple murders or whatever the case may be D you know. Yeah. Yeah, he was like, F uh, the the defense, the defense they're were giving, given was that, F uh, D like his mother had, had been an alcoholic when, when she was pregnant with him C and so he, he wasn't, D you know, mentally competent or anything else. <Swallowing> Which is ridiculous, C and, C and the court found him competent, F uh, C and he knew what he was doing and everything else. E I mean D you know, it was, it was the best defense they could come up with. I forget. I think it was something like twelve years or something. It was, it was something really outrageous. Yeah. I think in general, F uh, <sigh> punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be. E I mean, it needs to be, D you know, it's kind of like the, the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet C and you wait three months C and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it. D You know. E I mean there, there's no connection between the two. E I mean you take these, D you know, most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means, C but, D you know, a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place. F Uh, they don't really see past next week much less next year. C And to say, D you know, D well if I kill somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment. That's not real. It doesn't have any real impact on them. <Noise>. Uhhuh. F Uh, you mean, would he be put to death for that? F Uh, <sigh> largely depends on the circumstances C and generally, D you know, from what I understand, it's, it's only the most <sigh> brutal types of things usually. Where it's multiple, D you know. If, if they can say things like, D you know, D well he was just, D you know, temporarily insane because of, some domestic squabble then D you know, they'll, they'll give him, D you know, twenty years with, with parole in, in twelve or something like that <talking>.
