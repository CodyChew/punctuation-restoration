Okay, cars, you, you maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car, we want here <laughter>. I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac <laughter>. <Laughter>. F Oh, that's great. I'm, I'm a hobbyist too, I like to work on cars too. F Oh, that's good. Was you, why they, they didn't, say buy it they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said, what would you buy, D you know. F Oh, sure, a restored, vehicle is, is great, A I think, certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good. <Laughter>. D Well, that's great. F Oh, yeah, you all, done a lot more, when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that. F Oh, okay. F Oh, that is good, acknowledgeable people. That's amazing. I, I do all my own work, F uh, C so, I, I have Chevies, mostly, D well, that's all I've got right now I've got three Chevy V Eights. I'm, F uh, I'm, F uh, a Chevy, I'm an American car person, C but I do like Mercedes. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid, C and, F uh, I do like the V Eight engines C and I think the, I went to the auto show with my daughter recently, down in Dallas C and, I, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines, right now, E I mean, I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. I, F uh, D you know, they said, they said what do we want to buy, I, I'm, F uh, seri, not seriously thinking C but I, I would like to, put it in that category, F uh, by a Cadillac C but I wouldn't, buy a new one C and, D you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one, C but, F uh, I do look for a one year old vehicle, with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, whatever. F Oh, yeah, I remember those. That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore. That, since they don't make them anymore, she, that could be turned into a classic, in, in ten, fifteen years, F uh. No, he wanted new one, yeah, right, yeah. I'm still a full size person, C and I like a full size Cadillac, I, I want one of those, I think they are, A I don't know, a classic C but they're, certainly not, they haven't changed in about, F uh, twenty years, C and, C and they'll eventually phase them out C and I sure would like one ever those, F uh, F uh, within the next five years, or so. Right. D Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too C but, F uh, I've never had a Jap, I've never had, a Japanese car, I, I've had friends who had them, C and I think they're a lot over ra, C and they're is just no styling to them, you can't tell one Japanese car from the other, because they all a like, D you know, I don't mean that as a joke, E I mean, they really all look a like, C and the I don't have any idea what, which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is, C and I think they have not, F uh, lead the field in styling, they do have sports cars C but the price is way more, you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car, it's ridiculous now. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, D well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show. I, I look at the Cadillacs C and D boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't even realize they made C but they were, just styled so differently, they were standard Cadillacs C but they really looked beautiful. F Oh, no, they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field C and they have that new, F uh, it's not the big, F uh, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years, there's another one that has came out in the last two year, not the Seville, the Seville is totally different, now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars. F Oh, yeah, it was a month or so ago. D Well, they have it every year. Right, now this was, F uh, in it was downtown in the, F uh, Convention Center C and, they had all the cars they had Japanese and German cars, they had the full range, C and they had some, they had some new cars that weren't even out they had, F uh, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, D you know, that big, big one that was, F uh, they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost, it had a microwave in it and everything, it was, they had several futuristic cars. Yeah. I know. C And I like engines they had a lot of broken down engin, A not broken down, E I mean, D you know, cut, F uh, displayed engines, D you know. Yeah, C but, F uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, D you know, E I mean, certainly interested in buying a new car C but again the, D yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines, C and, F uh, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while C and, I think that, I, I would definitely buy, again there's the question are we in the market, F uh, C and I could buy anything, D you know. Yeah, Yeah. D Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, D you know, my cars don't go to the shop, D you know, C so, F uh, I am the kind of engineer C and I've always done it myself C and, F uh I've got three of them C and, F uh, I can't remember one, I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time, I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on like I said I don't do that D you know. Yeah. I, I, noticed that when I was a kid, F uh, I was wasn't a mechanical engineer C but I worked my way through college as a mechanic C so, I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on C and now again, I've got three vehicles C and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know, C and, in fact, I stock the same part, I'm D like a little stock, if you, brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, D you knows <laughter>. F Oh, that's great, I've always wanted to that too. F Oh, I can imagination, <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Hey, that sounds like a great deal to me <laughter>. You have great aspirations <laughter>. D Well, let's see I, we just bought, F uh, a seventythree Mercedes that we have restored C and it, Yeah, it has really been a lot of fun. F Uh, we found some guys that actually, D you know, worked for a Mercedes dealership C and, F uh, they also repair them for other the people on their off time so have, we, we have redone that thing from stem to stern, E I mean inside, outside, D you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it, so, D you know, I really haven't thought much past that <laughter> it seems like, D you know, I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again, D you know. Maybe not. Yeah, that's true. I, I don't know it just seems like, F uh, D you know, for what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more, than, D you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, we, the one thing that, F uh, we did decide as, it's, it's, we wanted it to be as authentic as possible C but we did break down and put a C D player in it, <Laughter>. that's not quite authentic, C but at any rate that, that was one thing that I, one of the features that I did want, I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it, I had to stop there. Yeah, D well, of course, we do it ourselves C but, like I said, we were just lucky to find these guys that do it, D you know, they're, they just weren't really expensive, C and, F uh, yeah, D you know, right, C and they work on it, C so, the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and, and work on it or work on it, C so, yeah, it's, D you know, it's really, it's really been nice. We, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. You're an American car person. Yeah, yeah, I, I have always had an American, American car C and, F uh, I had a real, real bad experience with the Cougar that I had, it was an eightytwo Cougar, C and, F uh, I don't know, I think it just soured me on it for some reason because I had trouble with it starting, the engine blew up <laughter> in it, I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so, D you know, I, I thought what the heck, D you know, we'll try something different C so. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really. Yeah, right, yeah. Yeah. I would that that there's, I see a marked improvement, D you know, as far as, F uh, what I've heard about performance and such, D you know, so, F uh, F uh, hopefully it'll stay that way, E I mean, D you know, I'd, I'd, I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has D you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car, C but, F uh, I think, Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, twenty thousand, yeah, yeah. D Well, that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks. They had, F uh, C and I think my, my mother drives the SeVille now that's, F uh, I guess it's a couple of years old, C and, F uh, she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was, that was so, F uh, yeah, yeah, C and she, it final just wore out they had, they had purchased it, I don't, can't remember how many years they had that car, C but she loved the styling of it. No, she sold it C and she, Yeah. I know. Yeah, she kept telling herself that C and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said D well, just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it, E I mean he came back with a new car <laughter>. Yeah, I think he had an ulterior motive he could just see, D you know, dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went C but, F uh, they, they really are nice cars, there, there, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again, D you know, they had, they've scaled everything down so much C and, F uh, I have, I don't, I've never owned a really large car, I don't know, I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had C and, Yeah, now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, D you know. Uhhuh. That's true, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. What is what, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I know that, F uh, I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike <laughter>, D you know, I guess it just, F uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape. I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal C and she, she's had, she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it C and that's what she's going to buy again C and I'm like, F oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one <laughter> that you've got C and, C so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose. Really. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Are they still, are what they're, what they have out for D like the next year, is everything still pretty square, it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Now when, when was this, was this recently? F Oh, okay, C because I have, Yeah, usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair C and that's usually when I see anything, D you know. F Oh, I see. Yeah. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. F Oh, my word. That's wild, D you know, you hear about things like that C and you think that can't possibly be done, E I mean, it just, that's just too weird. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh, C so you could tell, see the inside of them or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, D well, maybe, somebody's finally woken up, D you know. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, D you know, if I could fine, I, I was really crazy about Jags for a while C and the convertible, had a is it X J S or something like that, C and I, D you know, thought that's a dream car, C and, C and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, D you know. Yeah, yeah. D Well, that's good that you can. F Oh, really, that, F oh, gosh, that's great. I think it takes a talent to do that, D you know, my, my husband is, F uh, engineer C but he cannot, E I mean, C or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it <laughter> that's might be part of it, C but, F uh, D you know, we just, I just say forget it we'll just take it in, and get it taken care it. He drives, drives a Honda. Uhhuh, Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider, D see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, D well, is this engine that I can work on <laughter> or that, D you know, my husband can work on or whatever, D you know C so, you're, you're pretty lucky in that respect that, Yeah. That's when you know, yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's pretty good, it's really been funny because we have D like been you are own contractors kind of with this car C and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything, C and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, F uh, my husband Carl has called all over the country, D you know, he's gotten these catalogs try, it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventythree,
