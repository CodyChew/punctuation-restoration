D So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing? Yeah. We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, F uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, F uh, train conductors F uh, on drugs. I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently, C and also on, F um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, F uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, F uh, high on marijuana, I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, F uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, F uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay C and it would, that would, tied up traffic for a long time, everybody died, the fire was terrible, it was awful. C So, yeah, I think you're right, I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field, C but then D you know, who would test all truck drivers D you know, Right, yeah I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested I don't know, even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught that make sense? Yeah, C and then, F uh, I think, Yeah. I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good. I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it D you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone I don't, I don't know. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, Get rid of him. Right, yeah. B, Yeah. Right, I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible thi, D you know, it's really funny though, F um, I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high F um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school C and, F um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school C and a friend came and got me, C and I was there, C and I could smell the dope, C and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him C and nothing ever happened, C and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever, C but I really, F uh, I'm so anti drunk driving, C and, C and drugs have, F uh, long lasting effects C and I guess when I younger I was, F um, probably a little more liberal on the subject. Yeah, C but as I've, as soon as that happened, I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine C but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed. Uhhuh. Right. F Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff. Right. Right, yeah, I don't think somebody, Yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life. I can't even say, D you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life. You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. I think in some professions it's, F uh, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly. Uhhuh. F Oh, my goodness, They, that's, that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle E I mean. Uhhuh. Right. Yes, F uh, it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative, F uh career. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh however, here in Dallas F uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team C and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing, C and was to the point, he was on probation, he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract, C and they wouldn't have to pay him, C and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him, C but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract C and, F uh, just recently he was, F uh, missing from practice C and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem C and C so a mandatory drug test was done was positive, C so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract. C And so, in his case, he lost his whole career, he's been in the paper, in jail, C and it's just been awful C and talk about a terrible role model, F Um. F Oh, my goodness. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's terrible. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think most of us are. Uhhuh. Yes, if you know someone, for example we have, F uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed, C and, F uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school he went through surgery after surgery C and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again. C And he, as far as his ath, athletics, he's lost all of that. He, F uh, has been tutored, C and he'll catch up in school and everything, C but, he's still not back where he was. He may never have all those motor skills back. No. Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through C and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train. D Well, he, the train missed him, C but, F uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, D like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head he was in a coma for four months, he's out of the coma now, C and eventually they think he will come back, C but you don't know that, C and C but he's lost, he was an outstanding football player,
