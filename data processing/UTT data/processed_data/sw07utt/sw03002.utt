D Well I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS C and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL. Yeah, D well I, D well I, d, at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime. I use part of my lunch period to, F uh, read the WALL STREET JOURNAL. Then, F uh, I read the, the newspaper at home generally in the evening. I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning. Yeah. Yeah, that's, F uh, what we do to, it, we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television, C so we catch the ten o'clock news, C But I catch the news on the radio coming to and from work, C but radio news is, is rather short. F Uh, most of the news stations, most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour. C And if you catch the news stations, F uh, you don't catch that much in the car. Yeah C but, F uh, Yeah, I have the same situation. I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT, C and they'd just stack up. I wouldn't find time to read them. You have to have time to sit down and concentrate on, on the stories C or e, all of a sudden you look and there's three, F uh, three weeks worth laying on the coffee table C and you wind up throwing them out without reading them. C Because it's too much trouble to try and catch up, C so have to depend, I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, F uh, my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section. There's is all, F uh, strictly television news. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right, it's the same thing with, the news magazines, like TIME and, and the other magazines. It's hard to celebr, F uh, to celebrate, to separate the news from the comment, because, in the way it's presented their opinions is print, or presented as being the news. C And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news. That's right. Right. D Well so many of them also come through C and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time. Whether it be the homeless or, F uh, cancer or whatever C and then they devote, F uh, an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind. C And, F uh, F uh, particularly the local television. F Uh, I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit C and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something. I'm not saying that's not important, C but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects. Yeah, <laughter> s, <Laughter> That's, D yeah, that makes sense. We, F uh, again, like I say, by the time I read the newspaper it's the, the it's that morning's news from the day before C and I'm reading it in the evening, C so. I'm a, I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we, we, Yeah, yeah my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own. It's always, there's something going on all the time, F uh, you don't really have time to sit down and, and thoroughly read a newspaper. As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening. We had such a busy day yesterday. Didn't find time to even read it. Yeah, D well that's about all then. Nice talking with you. Same to you. Bye. Do you get a chance to do it at home C or do you mostly D like catch up while you're at work? Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL? I'm not sure what you do. F Um. D Well the, I understand that. D Well C and you have a little bit better newspaper. The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper. Lubbock is kind of small C and the A J s, F uh, kind of dominant. There's no competition, so what you get is what you get. We used to take the paper every day C and I finally quit taking it because it stacked up. I never got around to reading it C and so I try to take, D you know, weekend papers, C and then during the week, I catch up, D you know, on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home C and hopefully I'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where I can kind of get a recap on T V, F uh. No <laughter>. Yeah <clanging> <talking>. It is. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. We, F uh, it's frustrating to me because I really wish that I did have more <sigh> A I don't know, F uh, what do I want to say? I wish that I was around more news. It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on. I feel like it's hit and miss C and I haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis. Somebody will say, F oh did you hear about this that happened last week C and it might be local C and it might be national C and I'm like, no, I missed that one <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. That's true, F Uh, oh no <<said laughingly>>. A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased. C And yes, they report facts, C and yes you can get an idea of what's going on, C but, D you know, it's, an, C and I wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out. C But so many times you get, D well, F uh, this is my opinion of what he meant by that, C and I'm like, who are you to judge. D You know, just report the facts. Uhhuh. <Clanging> Yes. Uhhuh. C And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized. I feel like they focus too much on things that, A I don't know, D you know, so much during the Gulf War, they would ask questions that, F uh, you wouldn't want broadcast. It's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is. C But they keep asking these questions C and I thought it was really, D well A I don't know, asinine actually. Stupid. Uhhuh, yes. I agree. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, that's true, C and it's frustrating. C So I guess, I guess when I get to listen to the news, it's, it's probably television or radio. I see very little paper C but, I, I don't get to see that as much as I want C and when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad <laughter>. Yeah. Exactly, exactly. D Well I'm glad tha, it makes me feel like I'm not alone, though, in the world. I, I used to think that I was probably the only one that just, A I don't know, was running around so much. I look at other, F uh, women workers or, men at work, that have kids and families C and I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time. I always feel like I'm running a rat race. C So, I guess news is just part of that rat race for me. Yeah. Exactly. D Well. Yeah, that's incredible too. D Well I appreciate talking to you. Have a good evening. Byebye.
