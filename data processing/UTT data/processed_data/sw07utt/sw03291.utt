Okay, we're being recorded. F Uh, number one, I am one hundred percent for total gun t, control. I, Yes, I am not a member of the National Rifle Association C and, I don't believe in hunting, C and, F uh, I just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate C and I really feel that we have to do something in order to, F uh, to, Uhhuh. No, there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though, th, is, D you know, when they do it, I think our biggest problem is, D yes, the, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available. I think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available. C And the types of the weapons. E I mean there is no, Right, there is, There is no reason for it. E I mean, C And, D you know, when people say, D you know, D well, my God, they're, they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this, D no, I, I, I take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. C And, F uh, maybe I'm a little bit strong when I said total gun t, control. That's, that's really not what I meant. C But, E I mean we need control. We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening C and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the, in the in the public. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Yes. All right, you, you sound like you're into the technology of it, which is, D yeah, I agree. C And, D you know, C and, again, I'm, my entire family are, they are all hunters C and, D you know, they, they don't appreciate my stand, C and I I have no, I really have no problem with sports hunters. I really don't. It's just <laughter> when they come out and they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting, I think <laughter>, I think that's totally outrageous. What's happening is people are losing, they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue. C And the issue, is, the issue is becoming the focus and not what is actually happening with guns. F Uh, I, I think something will happen. All right, Ron. Total gun control. <Throat_clearing>. Yes, I, I agree something should be done, C but I, there, I don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons, because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct <lipsmack> will have access to weapons from somewhere C and that means they'll always have an advantage over us C and, F uh, they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself. Now, D you know, I, I agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally I used to be a great hunter C and in the last few years I've said, no way. Matter of fact, if I find a, F uh, a, a fly running around in the house, I pick him up and carry him outdoors <laughter>. I, I don't even hit him with a flyswatter, C so I've, F uh, gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and, and killing and that sort of thing. C But I, I think that, F uh, personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people. Most of the people really are, F uh, honest and, F uh, worthy of carrying on their lives properly. F Uh, I'm sort of in line thinking in terms, I don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon. E I mean there's nothing wrong with that. Do you see anything wrong with that? Right. Yeah. I'm again, I'm against this, F uh, automatic and semiautomatic stuff. I don't think we should have access to those. No. Huh <<faint>>. Yes. C And the, the people should be, F uh, selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're, they're not, F uh, acquiring weapons for illicit use. F Uh, that is not good. There's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms. As a matter of fact, F uh, there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who, F uh, brought to me a target from a rifle that he, F uh, pretty D well, halfway designed C and he, he put together the, F uh, the bullets in it C and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards. D Now, D see from a technical point of view, that is something that, that our military people need to know about. C So there are other interesting, F uh, facets in, in guns and weapons. This is a, F uh, bolt action rifle, I think he has. C And he has done other things to the way the, F uh, barrel sits in the, F uh, <lipsmack> the wood part of it. C And, F uh, he designed the, the, the bullets themselves C and he has <breathing> fantastic accuracy. Just, just from a technical point of view, that interests me. Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh.
