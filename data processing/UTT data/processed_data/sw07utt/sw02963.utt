<TV> Do you all, do you get together with family reunions C or, F Oh, that will be fun if you have not done it in a while. F Uh, where is your family from? Oh. Is it? C So you are going to have to go there? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. My family is from Kentucky. Most of them is down there. I have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas. We did when I was growing up. It was every summer we got together. D Now, my grandmother just passed away this last year. C So, D you know, she was th, Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well it, It sure does. D Well, we, in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together. We just did it word by mou, D you know, by word of mouth. D You know. C And, F uh, my uncle in Louisiana, he is the only one that, D you know, had to travel. C And now I have got a sister in Germany, C and <laughter> we are just scattered all over the place. C So it is going to be hard this time. C But we have got a huge family. Yeah. C Because it is so fun. E I mean, we, my mother has got D like thirteen brothers and sisters <child_talking>. Yeah. She has got a huge family. C And every one of them have five or six kids. C And most of them, <child_talking> D you know, have got kids <laughter>. Yeah. It is, we just, we had two baseball bleachers full of people, C and there are still about eight or six, eight or ten people taking pictures. Yes. C And it was just, the last time we had one it was so fun. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I, we have always had ours in a park or something. C But it has away been the same park C and there is nothing really special there. Only thing is, it is big, C and it is open. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. In Missouri? D Well, that was part of the problem with the ones we have. D Now, the kids would sneak off. C And we were just being kids, <baby_talking> C and we found what we thought was just an old water hole. C So we was going swimming. C And, like I said, we was just big kids. We was D like eight and ten years old. C And our parents came and caught us. We had been <laughter> playing in the <baby_talking> sump. It was part of the sewage cleaning system. <Laughter>. <Baby_talking>. <Baby_talking>. <<Speaking to child in background>> Kyle, don't. <<Resumes speaking to B>> I have got a four year old. <Laughter>. <Child_talking> Yeah. C But if we could have gotten it by a lake or something, I thought that would have been much better. Yeah. D Well they, there was, F uh, E I am sorry, there was, F uh, A I remember now, there was D like, F uh, a baby pool, just about a foot deep. Yes, I remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it. We were all kids anyway <<bumping noise heard in background>>. <Laughter>. F Oh, C but I love it, all the different foods, because that, yeah, That's the, yeah. C So, how long did you say it has been since you all had one? Yeah. D Well, I have been married almost five, C so I guess it has been seven years since we have had one. C And since then we have lost, F oh, D well, just our grandmother. That is surprising. Uhhuh. F Oh, if I can ever get down to Kentucky. It has been D like four years since I have been home. Yeah. That is, the reason, that is the reason I don't. I would get on a bus any day by myself, C but I won't do it with the babies. C Because, F uh, I have got, F uh, a four month old and a four year old. C So I am just starting. C And I just quit too <laughter>. F Uh, I won't be adding any more to the family reunion <laughter>. Yeah. They are good kids though. C So, F uh, I am not too upset. D Anyways, I have enjoyed talking to you. All right. All right, you too. Byebye. Yes, we try to. F Uh, we have not in some years now. C And I think we are going to try to have one this summer. My aunt is planning it. F Uh, Missouri. Southwest part of Missouri. That will, will be where it is. F Uh, if, if she gets it planned. I have been out of town, C so I do not know what she has been doing. C But, F uh, they are all getting very, very old. All my aunts and uncles. C So we need to see them soon. C So, Uhhuh. Right. Do you all get together often? C Or, Uhhuh. Right. I think as we get older, it is dif, more difficult to, F uh, when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now, C so it is, F uh, I have to, F uh, I will probably have to take charge and do it one of these, F uh, one of these, F uh, days. C But, F uh, I still have elderly parents alive. C So, F uh, it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date, D you know that, C And if they are, Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, my gosh. Yeah. C So the, Yeah. C And we need to have more and more of them. I ho, I think, I hope that is not a lost art, that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world. Yeah, it is. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. D Sure, that makes a big crowd. Yeah. Is that? Is that right? That is wonderful. I hope, D well, we need to have another one. I hope my aunt is successful as, F uh, later. D Well, it is probably not going to be done because I have not heard from them. I, it was supposed to be this June, C so I do not imagine there is anything coming. This is hardly, almost June. C So, Uhhuh. Yeah, that is, we have it usually at this, F uh, at this one park because there is a pavilion there, in case it rains. C And, F uh, you have to have it, F uh, fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there. In Missouri, yeah. It is too mu, it is not, it is just, F uh, very humid, C and the old people cannot take it anymore. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Isn't that great? Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that keeps you busy. Yeah. Yeah. It would have been. Something for the young people to to do. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah. Every family has all that going on, I am sure. C So, F uh, F Oh, I do too. That is the best part of it. Everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic C and F oh, grand, yeah. I do not know. I think it has been, F uh, four, three or four years. Or five even, F uh, since they have had it, tried to get everybody together. They are just spread out so much, C and, C and we really need to, F uh, no matter ho, what kind of crowd they get. I hope, Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, time flies so fast, it may have been that, that long since we have one. It is hard to remember, C but I think it has been about four or five years. C So, F uh, D anyway I, I hope both our families get to have one soon. Yeah. It is difficult with little ones. I know when we had, had our, Uhhuh. Sure. F Oh, Lord. F Oh, I am telling you. That is, F uh, <Laughter> No, I hope, it, I know it takes a lot of effort right with, with that, with two little ones like that. Yeah. Enjoyed talking to you. Good luck in everything. Byebye.
