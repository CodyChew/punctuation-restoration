Okay. Right. Why did I pick music? F Oh, C because I know a little bit about music, D you know, C so I thought that I would put that, C plus I, I like, F uh, to listen to music. F Um, I really enjoy the oldies, is what I really listen to most of the time. F Uh, Usually in the fifties. I'm not really sure, I think it's, it's a fifties, sixties, and seventies station that I listen to. F Oh, really. I don't know a lot of the, F um, F uh, musicians' names or the singers' names, C but I know a lot of the old songs. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yes, I have. F Um, I played the accordion for seven years C and I played the clarinet for seven years also. No, I played the accordion until I got into about sixth or seventh grade, C and then in fourth grade I started the clarinet, C and I played that all through high school. I was, yes. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. C And then in concert band I played the bass clarinet. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. I like the low notes better than the high notes. C So. We didn't have any bass clarinet players C so I asked him if I could play it, because I was first clarinet, C and they end up playing a lot of the high notes, C and I don't, I don't care for the sound of the high notes. C So I asked him if I could play the bass clarinet, C and he said, Sure, D you know, he didn't have anyone to play it. C So I played it, C and I really enjoyed it. Uhhuh. Pardon me? No, I really don't go to very many concerts. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, wow. I would love to be able to go see LES MISERABLES. F Oh, my gosh. Holy smoke. F Oh, I would love to go see that, and CATS CHORUS LINE I would love to be able to go see those. They do, C but I work, C and I went to, I go to college, I had just gotten, I just graduated from college in May, C and so I really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them. Uhhuh. Yeah. My brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff, C and he went to New York, a bunch of, there was D like twenty students from high school that went, C and he went to New York with them, C and he saw it, C and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen C and he doesn't even like that type of stuff. F Oh really. Oh. F Oh, D see D now, I like that type of stuff. C But my fiancee doesn't really like it. He's more into the New Wave music, Yeah, I guess, I don't know either, D you know, F Oh, I don't know, F uh, really weird names, D like The Dead Milkman, C or su, I don't know. F Oh, it's D you know, really weird stuff, he likes, C and I thought, F Oh my gosh, <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, I pretty, I'll listen to anything basically, except I don't like the real hard metal rock. I just refuse to listen to that at all. I'll even listen to country. I don't, I like some country. Uhhuh. Do you like Randy Travis? Uhhuh. F Oh, Hank Williams Junior? Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, D well, those should be good albums. If you have the chance, Yeah, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, I don't know, maybe you wouldn't like Randy Travis. He's really country himself C but, F uh, I, D you know, I, I really enjoy listening to his music. F Oh, I don't know. If I were you, I would get the Greatest Hits album if he had one, because D you know, that would have a mixture of all his, D you know, top songs on it. C But, F um, we have, A I think, four records of his. I can't, D you know, name the names of them off hand C but we have, A I think, all his records so far, C and all my brothers and sisters listen to them, even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him, C so. D You know, maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth, D you know, maybe you would enjoy Tra, F uh, Randy Travis. Uhhuh. Yeah, F Um, do you know any, F oh, I was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would, D you know, E I mean, the women, do you like the, Okay, now, now we're supposed to talk about music? Why, why did you check music? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What kind of music do you enjoy? Like what, what kind of oldies? Like the fifties oldies, or older oldies? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. They have the same kind of station down here, C and when I listen to music most of the time that's what I listen to. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh, we just got a disk the other day that was a, F um, disk of Nat, Nat King Cole's greatest hits C and it is excellent. It, it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it. It's really an excellent, excellent C D. We are, we were really quite pleased with it. It was good. Have you, F um, do you listen, have you heard of Nat, heard of Nat King Cole? Okay. D Well, F um, F um, <noise> <<finger snap>> do you play any musical instruments or anything. Really. At, at the same time, or, Uhhuh. D Like, C so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school. Yeah, I, I played the baritone horn in high school band and in college. D So, C and, my wife played flute in high school. C So. Really really. D Actually that's exactly the same thing my exwife did <laughter>. She played the clarinet C and then she played bass clarinet during concert band. Yes, yeah, C so. F Um. D Well, I like it, I, I like the low instruments better, too. F Um, do you go to, do you go to listen to much live music? Do you listen to much live music, like concerts or things there? Uhhuh. We're, we're going to one here in a couple of weeks. The, F um, F um, I don't know if you follow Broadway, much, C but, F uh, Michael Crawford was in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA on Broadway. D You know, you know whom I'm talking about? C And he's coming to Dallas on the twentyninth, C and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of, F uh, Andrew Lloyd Webber's <<spelled phonetically>> music. C So that'll be good. My sons are kind of into Broadway. They, they, my, my older son is at Columbia in New York City, C and he's been to see PHANTOM, and LES MISERABLES and bunch of other things up there, C so, C And he does it, he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing, yeah, yeah, C and one of the, F uh, the last time they went up, a friend of his wanted to go, C and Chris didn't want to go, C so the friend David went, C and he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets, C and they, they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bel John <<spelled phonetically>>. It's his house seat. That's under his control, C and he said it was a great seat. C So, he, he's been to, they've been to see it several times. Yeah. Yeah. Would they, do, don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh? Sure. D Well, we're kind of, D you know, they, D well, I saw two, two road shows of LES MIS, C and they were both excellent. C So if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows, and I think they have three different companies that tour the U S, F um, you should go see it, because it's really, it's really outstanding. Right. D Well, I think it's just incredible. I, C and then, D you know, those, F um, two guys who wrote LES MIS wrote a new show call MISS SAIGON <<spelled phonetically>>. Yeah, it just opened in New York this spring, C and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it, C and they got tickets for the opening night. C And they went to it, C and they said it was, it was great, it was great. Yeah, like Depressed Mode, C and, Yeah, I don't too much, C but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff. <Laughter>. C So he listens to New Wave C and you listen to the oldies. That's kind of different. D Well, that's good though, D you know. It's good to cover all the bases there. Uhhuh. D Well, we don't, now we don't listen to much country, C but we just, at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album, we bought Garth Brooks' album, No Fences. That is excellent. We, D Well, we, I've never, never listened. E I mean, I've, I've probably heard him, C but I've never bought any of his music. Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have, C or, A no wait, my wife bought an album of Hank Williams' greatest hits. Nope, this is Hank Williams senior, C so these are a bunch of old recordings. She bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks. It is pretty good. She likes it. It's a little, it's a little too country for me, it's a little too, F uh, ronky tonk or something. I like, I like the Garth Brooks album a lot. It's pretty good, it's pretty good. Uhhuh. Which album, which of his albums do you think is the best? Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I, I think we'll probably get one, one of his albums, because we do kind of like it, C but D you know, it's kind of different. D So, C so it's good. Yeah, we do like the, in fact we have a album...
