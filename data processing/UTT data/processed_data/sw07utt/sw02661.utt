Right, F uh. We eat out quite a bit, it's just my husband and I at home now. C So. F Oh, at least once a week. We're, we're retired now. When we working out we ate out more than that <laughter>. F Uh. Uhhuh. D Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard? <Laughter>. Right. F Oh have you? We like Chinese. We eat, a lot of Chinese food. What do you look for in a restaurant? You what? You, F Oh I, Right. I know what you mean. I like some ambiance, C and I like good food. I don't like fast food hamburgers <laughter> and all of that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it <laughter>. E I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices C and seven courses isn't what I usually look for <laughter>. It isn't, D no that isn't what I look for. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Presentation C and, D Well, like we, we've been eating some in a restaurant that <throat_clearing> that just changed hands recently, C and we're trying to give them a little patronage. C But Sunday we went there, C and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes. C So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that <laughter>. Yeah, that's what I mean by, Right, uhhuh. It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate. TexMex, TexMex. <Laughter>. Right, I know. F Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico, C and we've really gotten to like, we like the real Mexican food better than TexMex. Right. It's all pretty good, isn't it? Right, uhhuh, that's true. I'm originally from Maine, C so we like seafood, too. C And that's something we don't get here, C and we're in the mountains in Virginia. C And most of the seafood's frozen. Right. Uhhuh, that's true. Lots of shrimp. I know it <laughter>. <Laughter> I know the feeling. We do the same thing. My soninlaw is a Texan, C and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, yeah. It's like two ninetyeight a pound for a pound lobster. Yeah. F Oh yeah, cheaper, right. Right, yeah. A lot of the restaurants you can get two pou, two one pound lobsters for like ten ninetynine. <Laughter>. Yeah, it's a good place to go. Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there. Right, uhhuh. Uhhuh. We went to Gal, We were in Galveston last year aft, right aft, D well, the first of this year, actually. And, ate in a restaurant, C and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast. No. It wasn't. On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place. C And they had, it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way, C and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet. <Laughter> That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life. They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways. Uhhuh, right. It was wonderful. Uhhuh. F Uh, I tried it, C but I didn't care for it. Not there, but at my brothers I tried it. That's probably true. It, I wasn't hungry, it wasn't a meal. We just, he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them. Probably needed some cold beer with it C and <laughter>, Quite a bit. Oh. Right. We used to do that, once in a while, C but we don't anymore. Uhhuh. It's fun, C but it's just so much food <laughter>. Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable <laughter>. Do you, D well that makes a difference. Where do you go to brunches? D Like at hotels, or restaurants there? F Oh, yeah, uhhuh. We eat at Shoney's. Oh. Uhhuh, that sounds nice. Right, I imagine it is. Whe, out of, which direction? Out of, which direction from there? Uhhuh. D So eating out. What are you interested in in restaurants? F Uh, once a week, twice a week? Yeah, I understand. F Uh, C but we both work C and we have a daughter, C and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway. F Uh, really, I'm kind of open on food. I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer. I'll, F uh, try anything once. Been on a real barbecue kick lately. Yeah. <Cough>. E Excuse me. F Uh, yeah, we usually have Chinese once a month. I hate franchised restaurants. I despise franchised restaurants. I, I, I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run. F Uh, some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost. I don't, C but I don't like something fake or put on either. D You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant. C And <breathing> I don't know why that is. I think it's probably due to pricing, often. D Well, yeah, yeah, Yeah. It is what you look for? F Oh, isn't, isn't. F Uh, I try to get my money's worth. C And not just that, I try to, A D well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. D You know, and not just in quantity, D you know, but quality, and, and flavor and texture and care. D Well, presentation's not always all of it either. It's, it's important. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, something a little extra and just for color if nothing else. Yeah, yeah. What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican. Yeah, home cooked TexMex. F Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation. Yeah. D Well, there's real Mexican food C and there's real TexMex Mexican, D you know, by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage. F Oh, yes, C and, C and there's big differences, of course, C and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, <noise> <<dishes in background>> because <<pause>> its regional, too. C So. Oh. F Uh, yeah that's the way it is here in Colorado, also. No fresh, or almost no fresh seafood C and in Texas we got it from the Gulf. C And, yeah, here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation. <<pause>> C And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week. C And it was, <<pause>> I was like a man starving at every meal. It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it? Lobster? It's like shrimp on the Gulf. Two ninetyeight a pound. That's as cheap as steaks some places E I mean in a grocery store. F Oh, my gosh. I've got to go to Maine then <noise> <<dishes rattling in background>>. You may have sold a trip for some time. F Uh, it sounds wonderful. F Uh, C so, That sound good. F Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little <<pause>> F uh, seafood shacks, we've called them. C And, F uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. D You know <<pause>> shrimp straight out of the bay. Hm. Was it true? Hm. Huh. F Uh, yes, the cajuns. They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can. D So, have you eaten crawfish yet? F Oh, as with anything, it's preparation. F Uh. Uhhuh. It, there's all kinds, <Laughter> D So you do eat out a lot. One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches. D You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches. F Uh, we still find it fun. D Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor. C And so, Yeah, F uh, D actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's. Yeah, <noise> <<dishes rattling>> in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, F uh, we, F uh, do like Shoney's pretty well, C but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast. It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning. I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch. D You know, C and it's not that far. It's thirty miles. Colorado Springs. West west out of Colorado Springs.
