Okay, D so, F uh, do you own a P C? C But you have one at work. Okay, C and, now because, F um, D see I'm, I'm doing my, F uh, Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. C And, F um, C and I, I don't have one, C but I have to use them, D like during, especially during my undergrad. You, you use, F um, D like your first couple of years you use personal computers because, F uh, D you know, the software. D You know, D like it's easier for you to go to and run a program, D you know, through the disk, because, F um, the grader can do it at home. Then, as the, D you know, as you go up higher, D like in your senior level, you're doing projects which are, are so big, C and you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, D you know, a main frame. F Oh, okay. C But does it have, F uh, D like, a disk drive? F Oh, okay, C because, F uh, the ones that we use, yo, D you know, are like UNIX base systems. C And, so they don't have a disk drive. D You know, C so you can't, the only way that you can do it is through a modem. C And, you, D you know, you just do it that way. C But, that's, F uh, that's the only way that you can get to, through to the system, you can't store it anywhere. F Oh, okay. C And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C. F Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. D Well, F uh, for us it's, F uh, F uh, D you know, it's like for doing D like, D you know, D like resumes, and, presentations. We use D like for example, a Mackintosh, which is a lot easier for graphics, than the P, than D you know, the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that. Due, due to the fact that, D well, D you know, I, I haven't tested the, the P S two yet. C but I don't know if the software is as easily, D you know, like you can manage it a lot easier than, than the old one. The old one you had to go pick a line, use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, you know, with the mouse you do it, D you know, D like, a hundred times faster. C And, F uh, you also get, D you know, when you see it on the Mackintosh with, D you know, the one I have, that doesn't have any color, you can look at it C and that's the way it's going to print out. C And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen. C And, so, with, D you know, with the I B M what would happen is, F uh, since the software that I had was, it was basically, D you know, you only see part of the page. C And, so, the whole page you, you never can actually see it, you just draw it C and they have to zoom out and zoom in C and, D you know, it's like, every time that you have to do something is, it's really a pain. C And, also, D you know, it's like for, for presentations, it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a, on a P C. it can be easily represented on a, on a P C. D You know, D like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this, all these numbers. and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, D you know. C But, with a, with a new system I can calculate everything so fast, D you know, like for spread sheets. You can see what the trend is over the years. Yeah, that, that I, I had a, I had a program due C and F uh, one, one window I had the program C and the other one I had the program running. so if there was ever a mistake, I could easily check, D you know, I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error. Instead of saying, where did I make the error? D You know, go back and forth C and, C and, D you know, you always, D you know, the old ones you had to go out of your program, load up, F um, F uh, D well load up the program again, in this case. After you load it up change it, hope that's right, get out of that, run the program, run, D uhhuh, as long as it took, and then go back and see if that worked or not. C But with windows you can have the program C and D say it messed up in line fiftyfour. C So, you take a look at line fiftyfour, you take a look at the output at the same time, C and you can see that, where it messed up, because, D you know it's like in the old computers, the ones that, F uh, we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout, every time that you ran your program, you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background. Di, did, did you learn it in computer science? C And, when was this. F Oh, okay. Yeah, I know because, F uh, all I know is that when I came here in eightyseven, they still had, F uh, it was the last year to, to put all your punch cards in. C So, yeah. No, C but it, it was just sensational because I walked in C and they go, F Oh, my God, they're still using this. It was like, this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out C and, D you know <laughter>, You can get a hard copy of it, C and that's about it. C So. C But, E I mean, the price of computers has gone down. They said that, F um, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since, D you know, it started, they said that, F uh, cars would cost two dollars C and they would run forever. <Laughter>. C So, E I mean it's like, D you know, the, the joke with the Yugo, D you know, it's like, D yeah, yo, D you know, like when your, F uh, car runs out of gas just throw it away. C And, that, that's the way it would be. It's like D yeah, I think I'll buy a new car today, D you know, C so, Yeah, C but E I mean the price has really gone down. E I mean, I B M which, F uh, an I B M P C in D like in nineteen eightyone it would cost you five thousand dollars, C and now you can get it, D you know, D like for, one thousand dollars, because, D you know, because of the parts basically. Yeah. The parts and the labor is what they're charging you, they're not charging you, D you know, over pricing, it because it's like, if we sell it for less, D you know, it's like we're losing money, D you know. It's like we want to sell it to break even at least. C And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C. C And, F uh, C and the, F uh, P C Junior was a total failure, to them. They had, F uh, they're trying to get out small computers, C but, the only problem was that when they took that one out, the small computer was the I B M P C <laughter>. C And, so, you couldn't, D you know, it's like, sure bring out. N, into the market something that's smaller when no, nobody uses anything that's smaller than, D you know, this, D you know. C And, so. C But, over the past years it's like I B M has been producing D like every two years they bring out a whole new system. D You know, like the P C X T, A T, and the P S one, P S two things, D you know, C and so. It's just that you have to always compete C and, F uh, Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools. C Because of, of their, D you know, you can work with it a lot easier. C So, that's what they're trying to do. F Oh, D well, I'll leave you back to your work. C And, F uh, have a good lunch. All right, bye, bye. F Um, no, not personally C but, Yes, uhhuh, Yeah, several <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right, right. Yeah, I know I, F uh, I do have a, F uh, D you know, a computer at home, C but it's one that the company has loaned me. C And, that, that's been my situation, is that, F uh, that way I can get in, access our, F uh, computers that I have up here and, D you know, do work from home. F Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Right. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah, no I, F um, I, I have both, because that, that's what I use all the time is UNIX Systems. F Um, versus the DOS. C But then I teach DOS classes, F uh, at night. Uhhuh, part time. C So, D Well, that, that's the really neat thing, I teach in the continuing education classes, so I don't, F uh, I don't have to have grad, any grades, no grade books, so that's great <laughter>. C But, no, I find that I use the, the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect, and also for my spread sheets. F Um, C so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful. Uhhuh. F Um, F um. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. F Um, F um. Uhhuh. Right. Right. That's true. That's true. Uhhuh. F Oh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. What a hassle, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Yeah. C And, I love all the windows that they have out now too, they have really simplified things. Right. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, I know, I, F uh, I remember my college days <laughter>. And having to do that too. F Oh, yeah, uhhuh. I sure did. F Uh, I graduated in eightysix. Yeah. C So it's been fairly recent. The cards. F Oh, F oh dear. I didn't have to bother with that at all, thank goodness. Yeah. Yes. Wow, wow. Uhhuh, wow. Uhhuh. F Oh, that would be great. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Wow. <Laughter>. F Oh, sure, F oh, sure. Right. Yeah, C and the two eightysix too, C so, yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. D Well. Okay. Thanks. Bye.
