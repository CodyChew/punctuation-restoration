Okay. Guess we can go ahead. F Uh, D well, I guess D you know it's, D you know, since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day. C So, do you work? Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, C and buying suits and stuff, D yeah, because just being at home C and, I work at home, C so, I just have, D you know, I just wear my, D you know, my shorts and stuff like that. I don't go out and spend lots of money on, F uh, different, D you know, suits and stuff, D you know. C But when I, before I got married, D you know, I was working C so I, F uh, <talking> D you know, I had more suits and stuff then C but, Worry about all that kind of stuff <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. When you're training, right. Yeah. Uhhuh, moved from, Winter. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, C because I came from Wyoming C and I had wool suits and wool skirts C and, D You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear, because you can't wear them here. C And, F uh, the seasons are just so much different. You have so much summer. C And, F uh, C so then when I, D you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear <laughter>. Yeah <noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them. C And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know. D So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Clothes, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, C and I, I just don't spend, D you know, right now my clothes come from Target, D you know <laughter>. Yes, C and they, you take them out of the drier C and they're wadded up in a ball. Oh <laughter>, I'm so glad to meet somebody that, that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house. D You know, I have very little furniture, C but my ironing board is part of my decor C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, yeah it is, it is, C but it's like, F uh, I just don't want to do it <<fading>>, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>, that's an idea. Yeah. Yeah, I, D you know, if I have, if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house C and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room, I will put it away, C but I iron our clothes as we go along, C so, D you know, Right, no. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You can't iron it all C and, Yeah. C And then with my kids, they're always getting into, D you know, they can't decide what they want to wear so they, change their minds, D you know, I know, E I mean my oldest is only four, C but she's still changes her mind two or three times, before she figures out what she's going to wear C so, C And then they never put anything back. Uhhuh. Yeah, that, that, that's called smart, D you know, they don't, we don't do that kind of stuff, D you know. That's called too easy on mom. Our lot in life is to make her life miserable C so, F Uh. Yeah, <lipsmack> D well that's, it's been good talking to you, to see somebody, hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do C and they just go, F oh, how do you do that? It's like, it's easy, you just do it, D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, D you know. My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes. You know. Yeah. He wouldn't know where to put things C so, Yeah C so, F Oh, it was nice talking with you, too. Take care. Byebye. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Yes, uhhuh, yeah, I do work. F Uh, C and, C but I work at a manufacturing plant, C so I wear a lot of blue jeans, and Tshirts. C But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress, and high heel shoes C and I feel really uncomfortable doing that C and, in the plant so, F uh, it's, it's a problem for me. C But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a Tshirt. Very, very, comfortable. I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Right <breathing>. <Laughter> D Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working, F uh, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff <breathing>, C but now that I, D you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that. F Uh, C but occasionally I have to because, F uh, part of my job is teaching, and training, C and, F uh, C so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal, garb <laughter>. Than your normal garb <laughter>. C But I'm like you, too, F uh, I moved from Ohio down to here C and I had mostly polyesters and, wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes, C and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time. That's really, that's been a problem for me. <Laughter>. Right. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter> That's true, that's true. D Well, I know, I was just now, F uh, F uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes, C and I was going through here C and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years. C And, C because it's a wool skirt C and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it. C And I have five or six wool skirts, C so I was thinking D well, maybe, D you know, I need to think about getting rid of them, C but <breathing> D no, I folded it up neatly and put it away <laughter>, maybe next year <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I know, I agree with you <breathing>. D Well, I know last year, F uh, D well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold. C But the previous winter we had more, F uh, cold weather where I was able to actually wear, your double and triple layerings of, F uh, clothes D yeah, like you would when you're up north. C So <lipsmack>, that's really interesting. Yes, yes, yes, C and they're all one hundred percent cotton C and <laughter>, Yes, yes, I know. C So I, F uh, I have my ironing board sitting out all the time, I never put mine away <laughter>, It is, it is. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's true, C and, C and I've been looking at these, F uh, F uh, D like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got, that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the F uh, F uh, what, the, the, the door. C And, F uh, C and then you can ha, actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, D you know, to have it, permanently attached, C and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because <breathing> mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom C and it's just, it's just an eyesore, I think, with all the, Uhuh, uhuh. No. I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet, and, and running, D you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there C and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore <laughter>. Yeah. C So, I have a big closet. Uhhuh. Yeah <noise>. Uhhuh. I no longer do that weekly thing, because I have so many, C and I'm like you, I, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need C and that's it. C Because it's too many, hundred percent cotton. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. F Oh, I know, I know. No, no of course not. No, that, F uh, that would be too simple. <Laughter>. Absolutely not <laughter>. That's right. Uhhuh, absolutely, absolutely. Oh. <Laughter>. That's right <laughter>. That's right, you do, you do. C So, F uh, C but, yeah, I, F uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, F uh, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, F uh, an ever present thing in our household C so, <Laughter>. <Laughter> There you go. Things that need to be mended, things that have to get ironed, Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. That's true. F Oh, D well, it was nice talking with you. Okay, take care. Uhhuh, byebye.
