F Oh, uhhuh. D Well, no, <laughter> would they, no. D Well both of mine are boys. They're eight and eleven C and they're into sports E I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight <laughter>. Baseball has started. F Oh, F oh, yes, we start here at, F uh, five. Up until, it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May. C So he's going to be with, F uh, regular pitching C and my eleven year old, of course, D you know, is pitching. Uhhuh. C But yes, we're into baseball, C and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. We even have peewee basketball here. D So there's always something. Both. If we're not doing sports we go somewhere. F Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, usually in the summer time. Different places every year. We, No <laughter>. Uhhuh. D You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often, C and that must be the thing. They really hadn't either. They went to the Memorial, D you know, when they go, it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see. F Oh, I bet it is, too. Uhhuh. F Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places. C But our child, C but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close. F Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh. F Oh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, yes, C but we try, D you know, I try, my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does C because, F uh, my dad died, D you know, when I was less than a year old C so I always just had a mother. C So I always thought, when I have kids, D you know, I really want to be involved with them. Material things, yes, that is, yes, Uhhuh. Best friends, now. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, you have to E I mean, you honestly do. Now I have friends that I love to death, C but, C and they have children, C but their children does anything, we have to take them, and, D you know to do it. C And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while C because you're saying, D Well, I work full time too, D you know. Yeah, F oh, yeah. Problem, uhhuh Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah, I agree with you very much so. Now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college, C and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then. Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah. That's right, C but you can't take this money with us, though that's how I keep looking at it. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, if you cou, if you can, yeah. Yeah. What are you learning to be? What degree, E I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college? F Oh, that's, my husband's into, F uh, computers. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And you don't want to? No, no. Oh. Oh. Then you'll never leave. F Oh. Uhhuh. D Well maybe something will open up for you. Uhhuh. D Well, may, D well I've enjoyed talking to you. Okay, byebye. Okay, D well personally, I don't have any children. I'm twentytwo C and I'm doing my Master's at N C State C so, F uh, F uh, children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now. D So what, what, how do you spend the time with your children? F Um. Okay, C and did, Yeah. What, what are you doing? F Oh, okay. Do, do they play D like, F uh, D like does the eight year old play baseball? Okay, C and, C and in, in his league do they have D like a pitcher, C or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what? Okay. F Oh, okay. Yeah. I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York, C so. <Laughter>. Yeah, C and how about, how about D like on the weekends. Do you do sports C or do you go out? Do you go, how about D like for, F uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off? In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now? C And where do you go? Have, have you been out of the country? F Oh, okay, D well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave, E I mean I, I lived in places, D like when I lived in Washington, F uh, Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial, C and then when I went back to visit, I went to the Washington Memorial. Right. Right. D Well, it's, it's a beautiful city. C But, the problem is, D like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas C and that was the most boring place on earth. Yeah. Did, F uh, did, D like, did you go to Disneyland? F Oh, okay. D So, C but F um, D now, I don't know, C but F um, C but let's see, when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean. That, that was fun. That was, C and, F uh, then after that, I, my sister lives in Turkey, C so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey. C And this Christmas, I went to Turkey. C But basically, it's a, for the past couple of years, I, since my parents are, are, D well, I'm from Argentina, C and my parents live down there. C So, all the traveling I do is alone. C And, F uh, we were never much of, F uh, a very, F uh, family thing, D you know, made, D like go skiing in Vermont or something. That was, F uh, that was a lot of fun. C But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, C so there's never much of a family <laughter> family thing. D You know, one of those hell family vacations. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, C so he could buy us material things. C And, C and to me, D you know, it's D like, now I'm twentytwo, C but I still feel, D you know, it's D like D yeah, we never threw a football or something C and the way I was brought up, C and he wants me now, he, D like he, D you know, D like he wants to be best friends now C and it's very hard for me C because, D you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, C and it's always the same man C and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, C and he wants to be best friends C but, F uh, D you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, C because, D you know, F um, everything that he taught me, D you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, D you know. It's D like, D you know, I love you C and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, D you know C and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, D like, D like I've seen my uncle and his family, D you know, does everything together, C and D you know, his kids are, D you know, when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, F uh, they would go to the beach, C and she could go to sleep at two in the morning D you know C and, F uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you have, just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up D you know, C but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, C but, F uh, it's just, it's just something that, D you know, my theory is, D you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, D well, what I'll do is, D you know, D like, E I mean, you might have problems, C but it's not your kids' problems D you know, C and you got to try to be with them as much as you can C and to, D you know, D like, thing is, is, that, D you know, D like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem D you know, C and, F uh C and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, D you know, first of all you're coming to me C and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, D you know, C and that's F uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, C because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better. Yeah. Yeah, my, my father was raising four ki, F oh D well, three kids before he had me, C so it was, F uh, D you know, you're trying, to support, F uh, four kids, C and it's pretty hard D you know, C and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids. He says yeah, C but then I wouldn't have you, I go, yeah, C but then you would have a lot of money <laughter>. Yeah. C But, D you know, D like, four, E I mean fou, four children is expensive, especially when you consider D like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition. I'm paying, D you know, three thousand, no, what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester. C And, D you know, people say, D you know, it's expensive to think it's college, C but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, D you know, it's D like, what does it, what does it cost. It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose. Now they go to a state college C and they live at home D you know, C and D well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, C but D you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, D you know, D like E I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars D you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, D you know. F Oh, F oh, excuse me? D Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering. Yeah, C and, C and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home C because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina. D Well, my dad wants me to go back. C So. No. No, C because if you go back there, then you can never get out. D Like you don't have any money to, to, get out. C So, F uh, C and, F uh, I was thinking, D you know, D like, Oh my God, D you know, I go back there, C and then, C and I get married there, C and now I have kids there, C and then I'll never leave the place, D you know. Yeah, I know, C and that's, that's what happened to my brother. He came to school up here, C and then when he went down there, he was just so bad off, D you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain. C So. Yeah, I've been calling a lot of companies. There, some of them are interested. D Well, at least for a year and a half I can work, C so. All right, same here. Byebye.
