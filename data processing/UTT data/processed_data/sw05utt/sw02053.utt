F Um, what kind of hobbies do you have? Really, I like crossstitch too. <Laughter> I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately. <Laughter> Uhhuh. F Oh, several years. My husband is even interested in it now. He likes to help me design, F um, D you know, projects that are, a little more customized. Not that hard. I really enjoy it. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Um, I do mostly that, F um, not very artistic really for like painting and stuff. C But, now I don't know. F Oh, really <laughter>. Yeah, I've got the kits to put them all in. I don't have them all yet <talking> certainly. F Oh, yeah. I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have, C and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, D you know, just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on. Uhhuh. Yeah. A lot of times you can do that. I think, I the pinks, there's like fortytwo different shades of pink. Pinks and greens. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, not lately <laughter>. I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there. Yeah. How old? F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one. He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway <laughter>. You would have C but, F Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's kind of strange <laughter> that we got the same call. It's a call. No, that's okay. F Oh, wow. No, I just started about, D well, five years ago, I think. Uhhuh <throat_clearing>. There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans, C and I got one done C and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished. Bear thing. D Well, yeah I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it. I didn't, F um, I didn't buy the, F uh, I didn't buy a kit. Uhhuh. It's that cloth. It's an, cloth I think. C And it has the borders and everything already. Number one turned out just great, C and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery C and I didn't even know it. I gave it to her C and she said how did you know those are the colors we used. I said <<pause>> didn't <laughter>. It worked out that way. Uhhuh. Yeah. Lilly, Lilly, she said, she said it's for your daughter to use. F Oh, no. She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it. She hung it on the wall. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. True. Okay. You too. Uhhuh, bye bye. F Um, I do a lot of crossstitching and painting, when I do have spare time. F Oh, I love it. That's my case also. I've got a new born C and there's just no time. Have you been crossstitching long? F Oh, really. Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern C and he says how do you get that from there to the material <laughter>. F Oh, it's not. C And once you get started on it, it's just, F oh, I just, I love it. I do a lot of my own patterns also. In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, D you know, from Glenn County that, F uh, was a real good one to do. It was tough, C but, F uh, yeah. Do you have any others, C or is this mainly crossstitching? F Oh, uhhuh. F Um, Yeah. I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors <laughter>. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. I got to counting the other day C and, F uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred, C and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this <laughter> is, F uh, it, D yeah, it can add up quick. Uhhuh. Right. I see. D Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, D you know, what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar. Good grief <laughter>. Yeah, there's lots of pinks and greens. There's lots of shades of greens. C But the colors, I just love all the different colors. They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to. C But, you don't have much spare time either? F Oh, yes. C And that does take some time. C And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, F uh, with having a baby, C and. He's seven months old. C And just into everything, C so there's not a spare moment. F Oh, C but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And, F uh, work on his Christmas stocking. We missed it last year, C so hopefully this year he'll have one. Right. <Laughter>.. Right. If it tasted good, yeah. All he liked was the lights this year, C so. F Oh, D well, that's neat that you like crossstitching also. Yeah. F Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Okay <laughter>, F uh, C but, yeah, I've been doing it for probably ten years or so. C But it is peaceful, E I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it. <Laughter> On that, F uh is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares? F Oh, uhhuh. D Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for crossstitching. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. Those are pretty. F Oh, that's a. <Laughter> That was a good. That's great. F Uh, that, F uh, now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it. I like those. Those are pretty. Yes, my, F uh, grandmother, F um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby, C and I was like, F oh, I don't want to mess those up. F Uh, there just too nice. E I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore. F Oh, yeah. D Well, I've enjoyed this. C But, F uh, D well keep up the good, F um, keep up the crossstitching. All right, thanks. Bye bye.
