You have any pets? Yeah. Two dogs, what kind? Schnauzers. Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer? F Uh. I'm going into all this because I used to w, I just got done <laughter> working at a pet shop actually. Yeah. F Uh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. That's good. They say, <Laughter>. Didn't expect that would happen. Yeah, that's cool, that's nice. F Uh, let's see, what was the other dog you had? F Oh, a sheltie. Yeah. <Laughter> They can be nippy. Yeah, shelties are nice. Everybody seems to be really happy with them. They're good temperament. They put up with a lot. <Laughter> Schnauzers, in particular probably. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, I g, it seems the smaller the are, the, the worse off they are <laughter>. Yeah, the, they're bred down so much. It's, They aren't the best pets. Yeah. Yeah, E I mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, F uh, miniature poodles and such. <Laughter>. Pit bull. They might, they're actually very friendly dogs. F Uh, they're really nice. I, I've dealt with quite a few of them. People, F uh, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me D like, they, F uh, fit collars and stuff on them C and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, F uh, kind of like medium intelligence. F Uh, D Well, because some people, F uh, want to train them as, Yeah. You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. Yeah, it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. Right. Yeah, they aren't, they aren't by nature really nasty critters. They are very determined critters C and so once you get them going, it's not good to <laughter>, to deal with, but, they, I, I really like them. I was, I was impressed by them. They're, they're real sturdy little critters C and they aren't that big. And, F uh, just really friendly. I was, I was overwhelmed. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, right now, They picked up a lot of bad press lately. D Well, yeah. C But, any, any, any pet's going to, can, can be bad if you train it to be that way. D Well, yeah, it's, when, in my hometown, they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret, F uh, attacking a k, a child in a house. E I mean, these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. The, the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild C and, D you know, they should expect something like that to happen. C And so bas, now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. Yeah, it, it bit him. C And that was, that was not a good thing, C but I think it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was f, it was a fairly wild ferret. Hadn't, they hadn't, Yeah, E I mean they really should have, should have expected it. C And taken the precautions. They didn't. It's too bad it happened, though. Right. Do I have pets? Yes, I have a cat C and I have two dogs. I have a Schnauzer C and I have a Sheltie. It, it's a miniature. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. D Well, the Schnauzer I'm, I'm watching for one of, F uh, the managers where I work C and he's been transferred to Germany for a while C and I'm taking care of his dog C and, F uh, C and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that C and he says, D well, my dog doesn't like cats, C and I said, D well, we won't tell him it's a c, we won't tell her it's a cat, because it was a kitten, C and, D you know, they just, they just love kittens. They just are fascinated. C So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet. <Laughter>. C And they get along real good. I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty, he'd flip. <Laughter> C So that was interesting. It's a sheltie. She's real s, sweet little dog. She's got a very nice temperament. F Uh, they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer. D You know, the Schnauzers are a little aggressive. Uhhuh. They're a good temperament C and they, C and they just, F uh, they, I think they have a good head on their shoulders. I think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, F uh, dogs that I have encountered. D Well, yeah, C but also some poodles, F uh they're kind of, there are some smart ones out there, C but there's some also some, F uh, not so smart ones <laughter>. Yeah, that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, F uh, some credence in that statement. Uhhuh. I, I'd, I really don't know what the best pet is. I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. F Um, And bull dogs <laughter>. C But I don't know about these, F uh, these, F uh, F uh, these pincers, these, now, what are they called. Pit bulls, pit bulls that are so vicious. Are they really? I don't think I've ever seen one. D Well, how do they become s, w, how did they get their reputation, then? F Oh, they train them to be that way, then. F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. F Oh, dear, C so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection. F Oh, dear. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's unusual. I, F Huh, D well, I suppose you were surprised. <Laughter>. After the reputation that, D you know they have quite an, F uh, F uh, notable reputation as far as, D you know, Yeah, they're banned from, in some areas I understand. Uhhuh. D You know, that, they must have just targeted that breed and said, boy, we're going <laughter>, F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, did it attack the child, then? Uhhuh. D Well, the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. F Um. Sure, yeah. Yeah, C because then the, the animal's in trouble, and not the person.
