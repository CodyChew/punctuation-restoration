D So, how do you feel about our policy in Latin America? <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, do you think that's, do you think that's right? Do you think, we should direct the government? <Breathing>. Yeah <<pause>>. Yeah. D Well, I have a friend that's, F uh, de, his descendants are from, F uh, F uh, Nicaragua <breathing> and, F uh, very, E I mean it's like his mother, his, mother came over C and, F uh, he, D you know, I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about, D you know, our intervention and their government <baby_crying> and stuff like that, C and he, he was all for it because it's just like you say, F uh, there's so many people there that, that get the kind of control that's bad, D you know, C and that their governments can become so corrupt C and it's like, D well, D you know, I use to feel like, D well, they, they, should work their way, D you know, they should, should be able to work their self out of it C or, D you know, why, why, why intervene in another country's, D you know, problems and things like that. Why, why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that C but I think just a lot of times if we don't then, then it, then that influence will affect our country too for one. C And for two, D you know, <baby_crying> that it does help. E I mean, D you know, I think the people in those country do want our help. The people that are under conditions that are, D you know, not favorable to this their rights. D So, Yeah, C But, F uh, <breathing> I wish we didn't have to. E I mean I'd rather, even if a country chooses a government that's not, D you know, exactly the kind of government that we have, D you know or, or as in complete opposition to it, at least it's their choice, as long, as long it's one that's, <<pause>> that, that makes since, so to speak, D you know, it is a government that stays in power, that can stay in power, C but it seems like most of them don't <baby_crying>, D you know. F Oh, yeah. C So you think D like C I A influence and our money over there. Yeah. C Or, C or government aids and stuff. D Well, then how can you, how can you say as far as D like in, F uh, Europe, as far as the, the toppling of those kinds of governments, D you know, D like, E I mean, Uhhuh. Yeah. C But we don't, we're not intervening in that, C or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing <<pause>>. Are, C And, Yeah. D See, I, I agree with that. Yeah, I, I agree that, that the communication that now, that communication has, become so much more widespread and, D you know, worldwide that people are realizing hey, we don't have it so good and let's stand up D you know, F uh, this is ridiculous we're living, with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is that, F uh, I think people are just saying, no way, we don't want anywhere of this. <Breathing>. Yeah <breathing>. Yeah. D Well, E I mean, I don't mean to, D well, I guess I do in a way, sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that. I think that, that, F uh, because of those co, countries a lot, D you know, where such Catholic influence. C And I think the Catholic religion itself was, was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak, C but, F Uh. C But, C but D see, C but I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion, as far as through the ages has been the rule, so to speak. D You know, they are the ones that set, that set a lot of the rules C and they are the ones that do keep the people down, E I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're, yet they're expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, D you know. D Well, when, when it use to be Latin. I'm just saying, that, the old church. Yeah. Which it's not that way now C but I think that there is, just that, I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around. D Well, Latin, F Uh, they still didn't understand it though, I don't think, C because I, I descend from that. C And I, D you know, I don't, can't, I don't understand Latin C and I'm of Spanish descent. C So <laughter>, F um, I, I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or, tend to be, D you know, the mee, the more meek, D you know, they tend to be more, <<pause>> D like not stand up for their rights as much. They're not really sure of what they are. I don't think. D Well, E I mean, how, can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to, to say the people in Latin America. E I mean, why are they, why are they not as vocal C or why do they not, D you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights? <Breathing>. Uhhuh. F Uh, I don't, agree with that. I don't agree, C because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in, in, F uh, Africa. I think they've made a lot more chances. They, they've, their very vocal. C So, what's the difference? Yeah. C So what makes the difference between, D say South America and the rest, E I mean, South Africa and it is rest of Africa? Yeah. Yeah. I think it maybe has to do with a lo, a lot to do with education C because you look at the, F uh, European countries, I think they tend to be more educated, much more, educated than, than Africa or the Latin American countries. Uhhuh. D Well, I know that Russia, they're, they're comparably more, better educated than we are, in our country. Yeah <breathing>. Yeah. In our country? Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that's just it though, good education. Is it good education? It may be free but is it good education C and that's just it are we willing to pay for it, D you know, E I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all C but, D so are they willing to, pay for, D you know quality education, D you know? C So, D you know, C and yet they, yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology, D you know, that we use to dominate C and it's like D well, D you know, they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do. C So, you're going to have to expect it. C So what you, are you willing to compromise a little and, and pay, pay some, take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education. C So, I don't know. C But, <laughter> I, I, F Oh, I'm all in favor of it, yeah <laughter>. No, I, F uh, I think we've been doing a pretty good job, D you know, not, F uh, not taking advantage of our, D you know, of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us, D you know, F uh, E I mean we could direct the government even more than we have been. I don't think we've been doing too bad. F Um. D Well, I think that, F uh, as a whole that the, being that the drug problem, the drug industry can, F uh, bring so much money to a country. I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the g, the drug, F uh, cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America. Just that, F uh, money is power, C and, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Breathing>. Right. Exactly. Yeah. C But, F uh, Yeah. D Well, sometimes that's, that's America doing that too D you know, we, we fall out of, F uh, agreements with certain leaders C and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader, D you know <laughter>. It's, F uh, That, and, F uh, that and, yeah, America starts talking then about removing bases and, and whatnot and, stuff like that, and people. Right. Yeah, I think that has a lot of things to did with, F uh, F um, Yeah, that was, F uh, I'm, I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not, C because on one hand you have, D you know, that the, D you know, the, Soviet Government, of course, mistreating a lot of the, F uh, Slovak countries and then, on the other hand, you have, D well, they, they were feeding us, <laughter> D you know, C so, F uh I don't know really what's going to happen. Oh, yeah. I think we're getting quite a, put it this way, I think, no, I think the people are, revolting themselves, C and we're, F uh, allowing, it to happen. Yeah. <Breathing>. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. I think, F uh, Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive, D you know, where it's always the minority that are, are trying to make the country better. <Breathing>. I thought, it was the other way around. They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this, C so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it, it's been, sort of D like, D you know. <Breathing>. <Breathing> I don't quite understand that. Do they even understand what's being said? F Oh, yeah, the old church. Yeah. D Well, they actually understood, it is in America where it was hard <laughter>. Latin, D you know is very, very, very close to Spanish. Yeah. F Uh. Yeah. F Uh, I never really thought of, it that way. I don't know, could be the, the economic still. D You know, the, there's, the poverty level is certainly, F uh, D you know, much worse in the Latin American countries. E I mean, you can say that about Africa too. I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic, F uh, country, C and yet, D you know, they have the same problem where, D you know, where kings and such, D Well, in South Africa, yeah <<pause>>. In South Africa I think they are, C but yet, D you know, Idi Amin was, D you know, in power for so long. <Laughter>. F Uh, racial, I think <<pause>>, C or like you say, maybe communication of knowing that, hey, up in other English colonies, or previous English colonies, everything is equal and yet down there it's not, D you know, I think communication does have a lot to do with it, <<pause>> D you know, in education, maybe. I don't know about education C because the black community is still not very educated down there. C So, I think it is communication, it's just oopsy. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. You know that, I don't know whether, F uh, actually I, I've always wondered whether, how the education system works in the Russian countries, the Republics, D you know. Really. That's good, <<pause>> in a way <laughter>. D You know, F uh, something we compete with. F Uh, C and I've been sort of disappointed how that they, they say literacy rate has gone down, D you know, that's sort of upsetting, to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer <laughter>. In our country, yeah, that is really upsetting C and, C and, considering it's free, D you know, E I mean good education is really still free. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh. Uhhuh. F Uh.
