Do you have children? Oh. I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter. And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school. C And I spend most of my time carpooling <laughter>. The story of my life <breathing>. My kids are involved in sports. My daughter has played basketball for six years, C and my son plays football. I, my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year <breathing>, because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere. Yes. I know, I know. The insurance. Yes. My son, is in both band and scouts too. F Oh, gee. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. We found this Oriental tile game called Mahjongg. Have you? D Well, it's really fun. F Um, one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis C and a lot of them played it, C and she started a group going in the neighborhood C and my kids wanted to learn how to play it C and it's more fun with four people. C And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, C and they both enjoy it. C So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad. C So, F uh, we play that a lot of them, C and, F uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies. <Lipsmack> We have family that lives outside of the state C so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips. C So, that, C and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly. My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping. C So that just kind of works out real well. C And, F um, I'm a writer by profession C and my daughter enjoys writing too, C so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together. Yeah. C So, Yeah. C So that gives us special time together too. C And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that C so I can help her with that C and she gives me ideas for my writing too C so. Yep. Yeah. Right. My husband has taken us to work with him, C and we still don't know what he does. C So, <laughter> we just say he travels a lot. C So, that kind of covers it. Yes. Yeah. He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months. Yes. C So those are the real killers. If he's just gone, he's gone three weeks right now C and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones, C so we just, D you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. C And something major, always needs to be done. C So you just have to, to handle it until he gets home <laughter>. C And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home. F Uh, yes. F Uh, we have two sons. F Uh, one's a freshman in college C and one's a sophomore in high school. C And you? Okay. Oh <laughter>. Yes <laughter>. Yes. F Uh, Yeah. <Laughter> F Uh, D well, F uh, yeah. We 've spend a lo, spend a n, did spend a lot of time, F uh, it really helped when the, F uh, older one was old enough to get his license and could, F uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole n, other set of problems. <Laughter>. C But, F uh, I, F uh, fo, yeah, for one thing. F Uh, <lipsmack> C but yeah, we, F uh, we do C but our two had, had, F uh, totally different interests of, C but the, there was not much, F uh, overlap as such. The, the older one is not, was not at all into, F uh, sports for the most part. F Uh, he participated band and, and, F uh, scouts were his two big things. C And, F uh C and the, D yeah, younger one is, F uh, F uh, the sports one C and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite <laughter>. Yeah. C So, F uh, yeah, we spend a lot of time, F uh, F uh, carpooling and, F uh, D you know, and then trying to be, F uh, up as much as possible with anything that they, that they do. C But then, F uh, we also didn't do, spend, F uh, <breathing> time with them trying to, trying to, F uh, D you know, just family time. F Uh, <lipsmack> we had a, at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth. C And, C and, F uh, F uh, C but we didn't, F uh, do it as much or as often as, F uh, I would have liked to. I would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some T V watching. What about you? Yeah, I've, I've heard of that. I've never actually, never actually played it. C But, Yeah, yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so do we. Okay. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, D now that's neat. Yeah. No, we've never had anything like that. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, good. D Well, I, D you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, D you know, obv, obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up. I, I, I grew up on a farm, F uh, in Iowa, C and, F uh, D you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. C And then what my father did was, was, F uh, in, D you know, obvious to me C and I, I helped out with it. C But, F uh, although I have brought my boys into <breathing> to see where I work, it's not that easy, C and it's, it's certainly not at all common, C and they, they just don't really have that same idea, C so th, they, F uh, it's a, it's a whole different, F uh, kind of thing there then, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, D you know, family time with, with him. Yeah, I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, F uh, don't travel too much. Oh. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right.
