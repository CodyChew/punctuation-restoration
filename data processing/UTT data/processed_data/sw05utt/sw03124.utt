D Well, the weather has been, certainly has been hot C and it's been humid. I don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for, F uh, this late into, F uh, D well, it's not really late into the summer, C but the, the humidity has hung around all of June. No, I grew up in Michigan, C so, F uh, C But I've been, I've been in Texas for fifteen years. C So, F uh, C but, D you know, I know the summers get hot C but it certainly, F uh, this humidity has just really hung on there. Yes. F Oh, that's right, that's right. I can remember it not, it's really August that it happens. You get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry C and it just gets so dry C and, the earth opens up. I can remember the first year I moved here C and it didn't rain, I moved here D like in late August C and it didn't rain from August until December C and, I went home and told it just doesn't rain in Texas. E I mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not, and al, D you know, every day was cloudy, almost every day was cloudy C and I, you sort of forget how much it did rain C and coming here and then it didn't rain, it was just wonderful. F Oh, yeah. That's right, that's right. Yeah. That's right. F Oh, I grew up in Dearborn which is a suburb of, of Detroit. You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is, C so, F uh, <Laughter> Anyway, yeah. F Oh, a teaching job. Yeah, I did, I did for a while, uhhuh. C So, I'm home with, home with two children, C so, F uh, C So, New career. New career C but, F uh, anyway, C so that kind of, F uh, D well, I had been down here to visit C so I school and said hey, let's, D you know, find a place that has a nice job C and, F uh, that's how it worked out. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, D well, it's a nice place, D you know, E I mean it's, it's a nice, that's a nice place, though. Okay, sort of. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Lake, I think Lake Whitmore is the only one I have real memories of. Which is, D well, I think it's, I think it's toward Ann Arbor, C so it's probably out in that direction, C but that's the only one I probably could name after all these years <laughter> C so, C But, F uh, Yeah. Oh. Right. Right. Sure, sure, C and d, isn't that where they have a summer music festival there, too? That's right, that's right. I know, we used to, we, we didn't do a lot of it, C but we did. We did, C so those are always fun. C And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to, C so, F uh, It was nice. I always tell people <laughter> that in the winter we use, we used to, F uh, my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, D you know, make a pond in the backyard for us. C So C but, F uh, D you know, we probably did some ice skating on it, C but then it chipped, chipped C and, D you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven C so, Yeah. Oh. Oh. F Oh, right, right. If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know. No, that's not fun either, C so, F uh, I, I just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets C so, C But, F uh, D well we have, our house is kind of on a little hill, C so, F uh, we get the sled out C and, F uh, the kids go down the hi, the hill on the sleds when it's icy, E I mean they just go down the ice. <Laughter> C And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go. I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there. Yeah. Are you native to this area? F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like, D well, D you know, last year was so strange having all those heavy, heavy rains in April C and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May. Kind of like pushed the season back a little farther C and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity C and it just tried to rain, E I mean, I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago C and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in July. Normally we don't have too much, F uh, humidity or, or, F uh, rainy time when it's past June. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, yeah, D see I, I lived in, F uh, Ohio mainly. I lived in, F uh, Pontiac just a little while before I came down here C and, D you know, so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities, you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather. It might rain on your little parade. D You know, C and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime C and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out. You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do. What part of Michigan were you living in? Okay. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter>. What brought you down here? C So you teach in Plano schools? Oh. Okay <<faint>>. Okay. D Well, yeah, I think a lot of people were, F uh, leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties C and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus. You know, the, the little joke about, will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light <laughter>. D Well, D you know, I, I said I lived in, F uh, the Pontiac. I didn't live in the city of Pontiac, I lived to the west of it. F Uh, I forget the, the county, C but D you know where all the lakes are around there. I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes. It was real close to where I worked. It was only D like four miles to work C and it was wonderful being on the lake like that. D You know, in the summer, you feel like you're, D you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake C and everybody's, D you know, out enjoying the water and such, C and, F uh, in the winter time the lakes froze over, you could still kind of go sledding and such out there C but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes. There's lots of really small ones out there. D You know, D like maybe a mile, two long. That's enough to, F uh, do some boating C and it was lots of fun. F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. C But it was, D yeah, just lots of little lakes C and, of course, it was, D you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, C but I just thought that was grand. C And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them, C but there was quite a few lakes all around there. It seemed like, it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where I was. I said I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac, I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from, from the city limits C and it was really nice out there. We had, F uh, Pine Knob D you know, to go skiing and stuff. C So there were things around there. Really was pretty nice. Right, right in the summertime they have musicals there C and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We used to have a Christmas time, F uh, some of our relatives would come up from Alabama, C and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas C and the kids when they were young would just go nuts. D You know, C because they were from Alabama where it never snowed C and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it, D you know, eternally. <Laughter>. My first winter here, I, I came down in, F uh, early eightytwo C and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be, couple days before Christmas. It lasted only a few hours, D like by noon it was gone. C And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go to work because the roads are all, D you know, snow <laughter>. C And I was laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke, ha ha. They said, no really, there's snow C and there was, but a very short time C and the weather got warm so quick it just melted it all away. C Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> <noise>. F Oh, yeah. I think it's fun, even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit. E I mean, sometimes the ice is pretty bad, C but if you get on the, the, F uh, grassy kind of part, you get a little bit of traction, D you know, not slip and fall. E I mean, first,
