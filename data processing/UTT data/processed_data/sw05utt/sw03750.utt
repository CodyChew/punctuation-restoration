Okay, C so you enjoy camping? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Is it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you have electricity out there. Yeah. You've got a phone obviously <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so, F huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh. F Uh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well I grew up in California, in southe, in central California right in the valley. C So it is a fortyfive minute drive to the mountains C and, F uh, C so my dad loved fishing and camping. C So we would go up. First, we went up just to, F uh, with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and D you know cooked our, F uh, hot dogs by the fire or whatever. C But then later my mom and dad got a camper C so, F uh we have kind of moved up. Yeah. A little bit in the world. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh that's, F uh, That will be pretty. That's really pretty out there. There are a lot of nice places, Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I, F uh like you, I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now <laughter> which is, which is very close to camping <laughter>. Yeah. D You know, I, F uh, camped in the Boy Scouts C and, D you know, my dad and I went out sometimes C but F uh, even my first, F uh, eight or nine years of working, I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction. C And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress. E I mean, when you have to have it, you have got to have it. C And, D you know, in those those kinds of situations, F uh, room rent which is outrageous. C So, my buddy and I, we just camped <laughter>. C And we figured, what the hell, we did it when we were kids C and we loved it. Of course, we didn't really rough it that much. When, when I was in high school, he is a couple years older than me C and, F uh, he graduated and went off to college C and, F uh, during the summer we would camp out at the lake. C But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove <laughter>. D You know, I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine. C And, F uh, D well, it was fantastic. We would get up in the morning, go skiing, F uh, that substituted for a shower <laughter> C and then we would go to work and F uh, come back to the, F uh, D you know, boat house at night C and, F uh, in the afternoon, D you know, it is still four o'clock. You have got four hours of day light, good skiing left. C And, F uh, it was great. C But, F uh, D you know, now all my life is more like camping than not camping really. F Oh, yeah. D Well, actually as a matter of fact, they just ran the phone three years ago. We didn't have a phone. They didn't have phone lines. You just couldn't get phones. C And, F uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string. C So, we are at the end of the mail route <laughter>. Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas. C But, F uh, D you know, right now, F uh, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by fortyeight's that got repoed, And, F uh, swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day, D you know. I'm in construction C and, F uh, D you know I just had this place D you know to shower up while I was you know out here, D you know, putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in D you know. C And, F uh, I came home from work one Friday afternoon C and our truck was back. Everything we had was in boxes C and my wife said, F uh, we're moving. C And I said where. C And she said out to the trailer. C And I said, oh. She said yep C and I said okay <laughter>. C So, we have been roughing it out here for about three years, C but it is not bad. I, we have color T V, microwave D you know it is not horrible, C but it's, it's a lot like camping. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Became civilized. Yeah, my mom goes camping D you know. She takes her, F uh, motor home. D You know, she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and airconditioning, color T V, microwave oven <laughter> D you know <laughter>. She just, roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. D You know. C But, D you know, she has a lot of fun. C And mostly, it is just a way to, she, she goes to dog shows. D See, she shows dogs C and, F uh, you can sneak a dog into a motel C but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel. C So, she, F uh, D you know, takes the motor home <sniffing>. C And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing. C And she, if he would buy her a motor home <laughter>. C So he did <laughter>. C But as far as camping, my wife and I have plans to, F uh, not really camp per se, but to drive up the, F uh, D you know, Highway One there in California F uh, as soon as we get this house finished. I am going to need a vacation <laughter>.
