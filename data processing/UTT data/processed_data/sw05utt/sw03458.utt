Yeah, is that it? Okay, <laughter>. F Uh, D well, we, I guess we have to talk about magazines C and, F uh, what, what, D Well, I subscribe to P, D well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time. I do, D you know, I enjoy PEOPLE. C And now I'm, F uh, <noise> I, F uh, subscribe to, F uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL. Uhhuh. Okay, are you interested in, in computers? Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, yeah, D well, that, that would be one of my peeves. My pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, E I mean, it's, it's really geared to, all they have, you have too many recipes first of all. I just don't, D you know, that's what I don't like about <noise> LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. Too many recipes, too many, F uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense. I, D you know, I like to read articles about things that matter. D Well, of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, D you know, one of your, F uh, your more intellectual magazines, C but it's nice, light reading <laughter>. D You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book. D Well, that's true, yeah, they did. Yeah. D Well, is REDBOOK still in existence? I don't know <laughter> if they're, if they're around anymore. Yeah. D Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, F uh, I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of, which I think it was either, yeah, it was Publisher's Clearinghouse <laughter>, They told me, D you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their, their winning, D you know, their list <laughter>. C So, Yeah, my last, E right, my last chance to win ten million dollars, C so I figured, hey, look <laughter>. For twelve dollars, D you know, That's it. F Oh, yeah, F oh, uhhuh. Yeah. <Noise> Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I don't know, I just think, F uh, D you know, it's, It's light reading. D You know, you don't have, D well, you don't have to concentrate, D you know <laughter> D you know. It's entertaining, D you know, C and, F uh, that's, I just, I enjoy it, I, D you know, I, F uh <noise>. D Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is very, wasn't that similar, E or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE? F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, I see. F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. Right, right. D Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, D like maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three, if I read three articles in, in, D you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, D you know, I did really well. C Because there's just nothing in there that interests me. I don't, D you know, I don't, I'm not into, D you know, recipes C and <laughter>, D See, D now, C and I'm not into crafts, C so, D you know, that, that eliminates, D like three quarters of the magazine <laughter>. D You know. D Well, I just got the new issue, they have Bette Midler on the cover, C so that should be one article that I'll read anyway <laughter>. Okay, you ready? That's it. What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you? I, F uh, take a computer magazine. And, F uh, also, F uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. C And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, that's true. I, F uh, I like it <noise> when they have short stories. D Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it. C And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while <noise>, C so I guess <laughter>, I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore <noise>. Yeah <breathing>. I think it is. Surely, it's an institution, surely it would have to be. C But, Right <laughter>. Mine, too <laughter>. This was it, my last chance <laughter>. D Well, I, I, I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that F uh, to, F uh, ENTERTAINMENT. C And I was real disappointed with it. I, I don't know, it just, not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into. It's little short articles more than anything else. C And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. F Uh, it 's just, D you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it. If you've only got a short time to read <laughter>. No, that's true <laughter>. F Uh, <breathing>, no, not really. E I mean, not the one I take now. It's a, it's a magazine C and it goes into all the movies, previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes. C And, F uh, I'm a real movie buff, C so that's why I thought I might be interested in it, C but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be. C And, F uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, F uh, the <noise> HOME JOURNAL and the, F uh, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, F oh, I really need to read this <laughter>. Yeah, D Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts. <Laughter>. That's true. Do you, F uh,
