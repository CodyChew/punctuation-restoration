Okay, while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of a couple of menus, C so I decided it had to be in it, informal or not. D You know if it's informal I'd probably choose something, E I mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. F Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something. I'm not <laughter> I'm not into formal dinner parties, C but I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread. <Breathing> F Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married, C but, it's kind of the bible of cooking for me. Then I have some from D like church that are more family recipes that are more useful <laughter>. D You know, budget cookbooks, C but C and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up. F Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did, of course I've added several different recipes, C but, what you serve or what would you <laughter>, D Well, that's good <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah that would be wonderful in these times <laughter>. Yeah, either they're really fast or <laughter>, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What's one of your favorites? Uhhuh. Wow, sounds too good. Yeah. Yeah, that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. That sounds fun. I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time C and I have young children, C and our budget's set, D you know, at this time, C but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand, I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of <laughter>. That's why sometimes I shy away from, F uh, more of a traditional cookbook C but, <inhaling> D well, it was interesting talking to you. It's a fun subject. Food is one of my favorite things too. Anything else you wanted to add? F Oh, wow. Uhhuh, that's good. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Uhhuh. That sounds good. That sounds really good. <Laughter> It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am, I'm pretty simple right now, C but. Yes that's probably, that's true, I have little ones C and we, C and they won't eat, D you know, too many different foods right now. <Laughter> Yes. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Spaghetti's a pretty <laughter> staple every other week or so <laughter> C and it goes a long ways too. D So. All righty. Talk to you later maybe. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. I see. C So what do you use for cookbooks? Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds, F uh, C so the, I, I, I, C so, it diff, D you know, have different perspectives that you are. I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to, to fall back on, C because it has almost everything in it. C But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, F uh, it's a good reference when you need to dig something up. What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK, I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs F uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, D you know, the whole meal C and so she's yeah, D now, D now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes. C But they're, C but they're, C but they're interesting they're interesting menus, F um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of. F Um. F Um, gee, the one I had most recently was, was one that, was, ha, she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, F um, summer menu, or something, C and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage F uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and F uh, some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there. F Uh, C and that, C and that was, D you know, that's, that, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes. C But there are a whole lot of, D you know, E I mean, I, I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person. THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, yes. Uhhuh. Yes. D Well, you had said dinner, D you know, D you know, what would I put together for a formal dinner. We, we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night C and, C and, F um, put, here, here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, D you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella F um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, F um, basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, F um, having marinated it first C and, my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, F um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, F uh, there's a little bit of brown sugar in there, C and it bakes up C and it's a delicious thing, C and it's easy comparatively. C So. F Um. I'm sorry, I just love <laughter>, D Well, maybe a little more leisure time to do it. I don't know, Yeah. I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes. D Well, there again, sometimes it was easy, they'd, D you know, canned ravioli was, one of their favorites, and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli. Yes. D Well, nice talking to you Cheryl. Okay. Bye.
