Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It doesn't matter to me. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well how did they feel about the, F uh, the United States interven, intervening <barking> with Patriot missiles, did, did they, Uhhuh <barking>. Oh. Uhhuh. <Barking> Uhhuh. <Barking> Uhhuh. D Well I live in San Antonio C and fifty percent of the population is minority. Uhhuh. That's the barrios C but i, it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city. It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks. I grew up outside of Houston C and I don't think, F uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston. Houston is not at all. Yes there's quite a bit of crime. Uhhuh. F Huh. I think it's unfortunate, F uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned, it, <<pause>> I thi, Yeah, yeah, we can't get involved in their civil war, F um, unfortunately, C but we've kind of driven these people out. Sure. D Well I think the war ended too soon. Yeah. We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal. We damaged most of it C but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything. Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait. C And once that was accomplished <<pause>> it, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come. I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned. They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes. Uhhuh. There are some Kurds living in Iran. I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did. Uhhuh. Yeah, it C and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war. D Well, this is a good subject, isn't it? <Clicking> It's, it's something that you can really talk about. F Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it, C but, C but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about. F Um, D you know, when they say the Middle East, it's such a big area C and there's so many different problems there. F Uh, what do you want to concentrate on. D Well, F uh, I'll tell you something, F um, I, I have a sisterinlaw from Israel, C and, C and they're really quite, F uh, arrogant about it all. They, they believe that they, they belong there C and they've belonged there forever, C and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, F uh, more or less, they, they consider them second class. D So, they're really quite arrogant about it. I don't, F uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem. F Oh, F uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans, C but, I didn't really talk about that with her. She, F um, F um, my sisterinlaw now lives in, F um, Switzerland. C But, F um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an, C and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them, C and they really treat them like second class citizens. They, they don't really want them around C but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such. C But they, they really do, they look down on them. C And, I don't know, being, I, I live in, F uh, Vermont C and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, D you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black. We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, D you know. I, if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people C because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, D you know, it's just like it's a dog eat dog world. C And here, D you know, all, all my black friends are professionals C and they're, they don't, D you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs C and they, they send their kids to school C and they, they, they F uh, D you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff. C So it's just a different world. F Oh, F um, I talked to someone about San Antonio, C and, F um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, F uh, the ghettos, I don't know, do they call it the barrio down there. Yeah, C but I heard that sa, San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it se, it just has a really bad problem. Yeah, like D say Houston. D Now I would, D now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city. No, F huh, there's a lot of crime? F Oh, my, F um, yeah, D like I, wer, we're so protected up here, it's, it's really strange. E I mean our red light district, E I mean, F uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, D you know, C and we're just so protected. C But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a D like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians. D You know, the Israelis can do anything they want C but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd. F Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, F um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities C and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories. C So they don't have that. C But, F uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq? It's just what do you do for them, you want to do something for them, C but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country. To do it, yeah, C but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, D you know, F uh, uprise. C And that's what they did C and now they're D like asking him for help C and he's like, no we can't get involved. What my husband had very strong feelings, he, F uh, agreed with, F um, the General Schwartzkopf, he said, F um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job. He should, he should have let them, F um, corner the Republican Guards, Yeah, exactly, that's what everyone says. E, everyone I talk to, they says, D you know, it's real easy to say that. Yeah, I don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh, what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine. They're going, F oh, D well it's not going to hurt us C so we're just going to let them go, C but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, tr, C and E I mean, he, he's just, They, D yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals, C and right, what they were going to say. C And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that. D So they were, they were playing it very safe, C but, D you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever. Th, they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartz, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done C and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to D you know, the, F uh, the go ahead to do it. C Because he had the fu, he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us. C Because I didn't realize that, F um, *slash error it was going to make such a mess. E I mean I feel really sorry for these people, these people are middle class people, just like us. Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood, C and you knew this, these people are going to come C and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you. Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry C and you're going to run. C And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that. D Well you know what I was hoping? I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, F um, dramatic stand and invade, D you know, C and then D like Iran's the big bad guy, D you know, C but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives, Yeah, I know, it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict C but, I, I, D you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians, why they didn't go save, E I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish, I know the Shiite's are their people. C But, I don't know, I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds. Yeah, I, I think they should have just done more, F uh, C and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid. It's, it's just so complicated. F Oh, yeah, D well, you, knowing them, they're very, F um, F oh, I don't know, almost compare them to a very egotistical man. You're damn right, I'm going to protect my family, D you know, C so, I, I was amazed too. I was really, I was really, F um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it. C But, F Oh yeah, I was, I that part scared me. That, that, F um, the Egyptians would pull out C and I just saw atomic bomb,
