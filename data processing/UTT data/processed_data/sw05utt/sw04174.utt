Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Damn it, I agree with pretty much with everything you've said. F Uh, the one, the one thing that I, D you know, I'd advise any parent, F uh, D you know, or any, or any person looking for a college, F uh, is that I think, I think, D you know, it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from, D you know, the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the, D you know, actual students there C because, D you know, they're just, F uh, in my experience, I've talked to people at other colleges, F uh, that, D you know, the, the, the way, the, D you know, the, the, the lifestyle pictured in the cat, catalogs isn't always <laughter> the whole story. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Clanking>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I go to Georgia Tech which is, D you know, primarily an engineering school C and, F uh, D you know, I think I really do miss the fact, D you know, that it's not a university, that there's, there's not, the, the, D you know, it tends to be a very conservative school C and there, C and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of, D you know, universities will, will have. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh, I don't really know of anyone that's D like look, that's looking for colleges now, D you know, because it, with the exception of, F uh, people's younger brothers and sisters. Then the only advise passed down is, don't go to Georgia Tech <laughter>. F Uh, C but, F uh, no, actua, actually I'm, I'm, I'm more interested in, in, in choosing the right j, job when you graduate <laughter> type information <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Program. Uhhuh. Uhuh. Uhhuh, like a fine arts education, I, Uhhuh. Okay, D well, Mark, our situation is that we do have a daughter that is, F uh, in the situation of choosing college. She's actually at Bible College for this current year. C And, F uh, I guess <breathing>, F uh, first and foremost, it, E really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then, F uh, F uh, which colleges or universities can best offer that program, C and then it comes down to the dollar. You have to, F uh, it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction, C or D you know, it does, it comes down to, F uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs. F Uh, what do you feel about come of the things that need to, No, y, the, the college, the, the catalogs are sales material. It doesn't matter whether, D you know, they're, they're selling school. C And, F uh, C and, true, it, F uh, really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school. F Uh, I guess there's a difference in, here the, at least, the university here in Saskatoon is primarily, F uh, off campus resident students. D Like, they just live in the community. F Uh, D you know, I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities, particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is, F uh, is right on campus as well C and that, D you know, that changes the character of it quite a bit. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, I guess we're here, this is the university that has, for years had the, the car, that, F uh, will travel the farthest on, F uh, on a small quantity of gas, our engineering students. F Uh, in competitions C and that's the kind of thing that also you see, F uh, if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school. F Uh, whether you, D you know, in one sense, whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a, a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates. F Uh, D you know, as sort of some development and some training, F uh, D like it's easy enough to crank out graduates, but to really challenge them C and, F uh, C and that can vary between colleges, and faculties even, as to how, D you know, what the attitude towards achievement is. F Uh, do you, F uh, have anyone that you're seriously needing to, F uh, feed information to? I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student, you're a ways away from that. <Laughter>. Right. D Well, that's, that's one of the, really, a valid point that people need to consider as well. F Uh, D you know, to, going to college, university is going to take four to eight years depending on the p, pa, programs person's involved in C and after that, you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself C and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market jeez, if that's, Right. Best training in the world is not going to f, put food on your table. C But, F uh,
