I really haven't seen any movies lately, C so when the computer picked this one, I was a little bit surprised, C but, I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about, F oh, six months, C but, F uh, D you know, the last movies that I've seen <baby_crying> were probably on video. Yeah <baby_crying>. Uhhuh. Yeah, now I ha, I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie, C but, C and that's kind of blood and guts, isn't it. I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff. <Laughter> Yeah, right. Yeah, he maims them pretty good, doesn't he? Yeah. Uhhuh. I, I saw, F uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. F Uh, F Uh, I saw it, F uh, F oh, couple weeks ago I rented it and, F uh, <lipsmack> watched it C and I was, I was pretty disappointed in it C because I, I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense C and I was pretty disappointed in it. D Now it's a good movie, C but, I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Now I haven't seen it either, C but, F uh, I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie, but it's long, like three hours. That's right. That's right. OSCAR. Uhhuh. Yeah. I know my daughter saw that C and she liked it C so, Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And, of course, I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, TOO <baby_crying> C and, C because I have a ten year old C so, We, we watch a lot of movies around that category, D you know that she, that she can watch <noise>. <Laughter> Yeah. We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID, too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And there's some, I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video, F uh, SHIPWRECKED. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's fixing to come out on video C and, boy, I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out. C But, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. That's right. C And then they go to the dollar movies. Uhhuh. Yeah, that does sound fun. Right. Uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Golly, I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie. F Oh, that's the, that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes? F Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is, F uh, F oh, I just forgot the title of it. F Uh <breathing>. F Oh, it's supposed to be a real scary one <lipsmack>. F Uh, darn, D well, here, here's another one that I've seen. I saw, F uh, I can't remember the title of it, either <laughter>. F Oh, D well that's, we rent a lot of videos too. F Uh, we saw, I have two little babies C and we saw one movie recently C and that was THE TERMINATOR movie, F uh, which I didn't like after all. D Well, I don't either. It, on all the, the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie. He doesn't. He maims them <laughter>. D So, Uhhuh. He, he, F uh, I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part. In the movie. D So. F Oh, I haven't seen that one yet. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah, D well, With all the commercials and everything. I haven't, that's one we want to see. I, I want to see, F uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES. C But, we haven't seen that one yet, either. Yeah, th, that's what I heard, too. Yeah, we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late <laughter> to watch it <baby_crying>. C So, We saw, F uh, the, the, F uh, movie with, F uh, Sylvester Stallone, OSCAR. Supposed to be his, F uh, his debut in comedy. Which was an interesting movie, but not very funny. Did she? D Well, it was, it was an amusing movie. It j, <baby_crying>, I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, F uh, just at the house watching it with, with no one else around. C So, Oh. Uhhuh. My son just turned two C and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie. LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are, are his two favorites that we've got <breathing>. F Oh, I haven't, I didn't hear that was coming out. D Well, they just had F uh, THE RESCUERS movie that was a Disney movie, wasn't it. I think I heard that was just one, was just out. He's, F uh, he doesn't sit still for the whole movie, yet, C but he likes to, F uh, to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the m, in the movie. D Well, I w, tell you, ever s, my, my kids are just small babies C and, I tell you, we really want to go a lot C and, F uh, there's so much out on video now, that it's almost, D you know, the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it. Sometimes. D So. Uhhuh <laughter>. That seems to happen. I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the, F uh, Granada Theater. C And, F uh, someone said that was a lot of fun to go do. You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie. I thought that might be kind of fun to do. C And, of course, you need a babysitter for that <laughter>. Definitely. C But, F uh, D no, I'd really like to get out to the movies more often. Course, it's so expensive, now, too that you can't hardly afford it. I, I know we get discount tickets where my husband works, C but, other than that it just seems like it's so expensive. C And then the popcorn and everything else, you almost can't afford to do it. No matter what. Although we did actually get, we went on vacation couple months ago, C and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB? That was kind of a funny movie with, F uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. That was fun. F Oh, he's a, Richard Dreyfuss is a, F uh, psychiatrist C and Bob is his patient C and Bob follows him on vacation. It's, F uh, Uhhuh, uhhuh <swallowing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's the one. Must have left an impression.
