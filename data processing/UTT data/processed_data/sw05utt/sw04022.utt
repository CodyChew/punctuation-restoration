D Well, F uh, I don't know. I think the budget is really out of hand right now, C and especially in this election year, I think that, F uh, there ought to be so, at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this. Right. Right, C and, F uh, D well, as you said, mostly they are token cuts. F Uh especially what, for instance, George Bush is offering. Yeah, ninetyseven cents a week. D Now what, that's really not going to do a lot of good, it doesn't seem to me, to your average middle income person, D you know. Another ninetyseven cents, hell you can buy a coke or something for that. Yeah. That ninetyseven cents really isn't going to do it for me either. F Uh, I, I haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either, especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as D yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point. I believe it was Dukakis C but I, I can't. Yeah, E I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said, No, I will not read my lips, or whatever C and then, D you know, ten months later he said, D well, sorry, D you know, I, I can't follow through on this. C But it seems to me that, F uh, that the budget is so out of hand, C and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over C and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of, D you know of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year. D Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go, C because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace, socalled peace dividend. E I mean, if they could actually put something together and make, I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste money, also, C but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of D like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever. Right, ex, Exactly C and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country. Yeah, C and C and there's no way that we can ever really recover from, from the state that we're in right now, unless, at least I feel, unless we focus on the infra structure, C and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now. <Laughter>. So am I. F Uh, I U. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right. You, you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington. Yeah, F uh, D well, it's, it's more than a loaded, it's a loaded cannon. E I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year, C and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. F Oh, no. Uhhuh. For, for the moment, C and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again C and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said C or D you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. No, no, not at all. No. Uhhuh. Yeah, it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering, D you know, their token little tax cut program, D you know, when it's when it's just such a bad time for it. Yeah. The ninetyseven cents a week <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, E I mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut, it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld, D you know. F Um, yeah I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot. Huhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, E I mean, D you know, in retrospect, F um, was it, was it Mondale or Dukakis that said, D you know, I'll, I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes? It was Dukakis, yeah. I have a lot of respect for him <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <laughter> Yeah, it's, it's. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, I, F uh, I, I think that would be a great idea, D you know, like the conservation corps, D you know where. It wou, it wou, it would help unemployment greatly. C And it. Yeah, infra structure is in, is in, E I mean, we, we, we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war. Uhhuh. F Um, yeah, I, I agree totally <laughter>. F Um, E I mean, this, this, it just seems so, D you know, so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen. F Um, I, I'm in college right now, C and. F Oh really, where do you go? Right, I go to Georgia Tech, F um. C And, in, what, I had pol, D you know, the required political science class a couple of years ago. C And one of the things we discussed was, D you know, where our, where the budget situate, how the budget situation just got so out of hand. C And essentially what happened was, I think it was like in the, F um, tax year of eightyone, F um, Ronald Reagan basically said, D you know, I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and, and, created this, this ludicrous budget that he knew, that, that, F um, that the Congress would not in their right mind pass C and Con, Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, D you know, A byebye, D you know, byebye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created, D you know, that, that, that, D you know, created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit. C And you just,. E I mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah, F um, what really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were to say, D you know, D well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're, we're going to have to do some unpopular things, E I mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected. E I mean, it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing, D you know where people just want, want to have, D you know, whatever will make them feel good, right now, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It, E I mean, I don't know, I <laughter> I don't, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with <laughter> ninetyseven cents a week. I just don't think it was a well thought out <laughter> incentive.
