All right. I've never done it before, C so I guess that's all I have to do, right <laughter>. I've been called several times, C and I push in, pushed in my number, they kept saying you have the invalid code C and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right. F Oh, C so this is the first time I've even done it. I wonder how long it's going to be on for. F Oh, no, E I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, do you know? Yeah, okay, D well back to crime, I guess we're supposed to talk about that. They say what aspect are you worried about, D well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect <laughter>. I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from. Uhhuh, golly I know. Have they done that in Garland? Now, F um, Right. D Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, D you know, on the school grounds after school. C And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school, C so D you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like. C So. Yeah, it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school C and you wonder if he's going to get shot. E I mean, we didn't have to <laughter> worry about that before. What next? Right, C and, D you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, they just can't do it. I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent C and, F uh, C and how we going to bring that back together. Uhhuh. Right C and, I think so, C and, C and then there's a drop in, F uh, the training of morals, really, D you know. These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more <laughter> morals, D you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood. I think it was just rare, I really do. My mother, D well, she's D like seventyfour now. She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California, C and she was dating this millionaire's son C and he wanted to marry her, C and she wouldn't marry him C and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, C and, F uh, No, I'm the one, Yeah, that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, C but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks C but now, D you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas it's just, D you know, another killing. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, lots of their picture and life story and everything. Uhhuh. Right. Right. I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible, C So, F uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, D well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, F oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with. Yeah, I think it was on a Hard Copy, she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college C and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties, Remember that? Right, right, <laughter> that's, F uh, My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School. Yeah, can you believe it, that's just, F uh, Taco Bueno, right, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, F uh, F uh, isn't that weird? I know, C and, F uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. D You know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything. C And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids gu, <Laughter> I guess so. F Oh, really. Oh <laughter>. Yeah. I think five minutes is the max. F Oh, I don't know. <Laughter>. Right, especially, F uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, D you know, there's so much going on here. D Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in, C and, No, I, not that I'm aware of. I just heard, D you know, <throat_clearing> last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting C so, F um, Is that right? Uhhuh. Not at all. Yeah, yeah. I know <laughter>. I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, C and it just continues to get worse. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's, I thi, I agree, I think that's where it stems from, is that and, F um, D you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children C and that may impact it as well. Right, right. Yeah they don't think twice about it. <Laughter> Yeah. Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the, Uhhuh. You're kidding. Himself and her? F Oh, wow, I bet. F Oh, I know, D Well, they were, I was watching some show the other day, C and they were talking about, F uh, mass murderers C and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, C and they were saying, D you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V s and everything, Right, C and then you get to their life story, F Oh, they came from a broken family F oh this person had mental problems F oh F duh, F duh, F duh D you know, Yeah. Is that right? Uhhuh. F Uh, I remember seeing that, I saw that on Hard Copy <laughter>. Yes. Is that right? I'm trying to remember, he, F um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something C and he just shot them himself and her. I remember seeing that. Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days. Yeah.
