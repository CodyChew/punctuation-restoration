Okay, what do you think are some current trends in, F uh, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen. Yeah <breathing> <<heavily>>. Really. Are you newly married, C or, Yeah. Same, same situation here, I've been married about ten months, C so. Yeah, I can, I can, I know what you mean. Yeah. Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that. <Cough>. That's we, that's wild. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it, C but, F um, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more, F um, where they could manage their own schedule C and, F uh, they could spend more time with their kids C because they look back C and, D you know, they're all D like, F um, kind of regretful, I think. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, same here. Yeah. At T I, is that where you work? It's really kind of sad, some of the people that I work with they, D like when I worked on second shift, F um, their paren, their kids go to school during the day C and then they wouldn't see them at night, because they would be in, D you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed. C And so it was kind of like, they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses. This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, D you know. C So it was really sad, jus, D you know that a lot of families, F um, have to, D well, D you know, have to have dual income. A lot of people choose to, which is fine. C But, F uh, D you know, then the kids kind of suffer. Uhhuh, F huh <<said strangely, high pitched>>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh. I know. Unfortunately, that's probably true. F Um, do you think s, the, the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it's more D like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, F uh... Yeah <dishes>. Yeah <<pause>> it's always that way unti, until it's too late. Yeah, it's true, F um. What's, what are some other questions they have, , I'm not sure. I know <breathing> my parents are growing up, I guess they never spent much time watching T V. In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the T V, we didn't really have one. Yeah, C and, C and they spent a lot of time D like outside with us and stuff, C but, D you know, my dad had his own business C and it was easier for them to do that, C but, I, I don't know, it was, I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Yeah, that's a pretty good way to put it <throat_clearing>. If I had kids, D well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do? <Noise> <<sounds like paper rustling>>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff, yeah, I agree. I hope that happens, in my case. Yeah. Yeah. F Huh <sigh>. I know. Yeah, C and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids. That may not necessarily be consistent with yours. Yeah <throat_clearing>. F Huh. I, D well I don't even think we had <cough>, I don't even remember them being around when we were little. Yeah. Sure, is, F um, <breathing>, D well, <<pause>>. I guess we could ring this off since we, we've exhausted all of our ideas, we seem to agree. Yeah, C so, Yeah, you too, I wish you the best. Okay thanks. Byebye. F Um, I, I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together. F Um, I think, F uh, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today, C and I've been off doing my thing all day <barking> C and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning. D So, F uh. F Um, two years. It's, it's really hard, hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, F uh, you both have hobbies that are different. D you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, D you know, you can enjoy your hobby together, C but my husband and I have different hobbies. No, no, he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector. F Um, C so he was off today, F uh, looking at, at records. C So, F uh, C and I was off, D you know, doing, D you know, hou, household type things. D You know, laundry C and, F um, did some shopping and stuff. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I think, I think that would be the ideal situation, I think that would be the ideal situation. I think that a lot of people, like in my case I, I do shift work. I don't, I don't have that choice. F Um, I have to be at work at, at X hour, D you know, at just, at, at a certain hour C and I can't, it's not flexible. F Um, it, it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours C and, C and maybe after we decide to have kids I, I might find a job that has flexible hours. I woul, I hope so anyway. F Um, C but I would, I don't know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, ideally, it wo, it would be nice to be able to just have, D like, back in the old days, D you know, back D like whe, when I grew up, D you know, the, the mom stayed home, D you know, and raised the kids. My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school. F Um, C so she was there pretty much all my, D you know, formative years. C And that was nice C and I liked that C and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids. C But I think with the way the future is, F um, economy wise, I don't think it's going to be realistic. I, D yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time. I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that. I think that, F um, F uh, most, most kids that I see don't really, they don't really value quality time. Until, until they're older C and then they look back. F Oh really. I, I think kids now a days are raised on T V. E I mean that's, that's almost D like a surog, T V s a surrogate parent. C And not a, C and not a very good one at that. F Um, I, I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong. I hope, I hope to be able to spend, F um, their growing up years, being in the home, D you know, not having to work. F Um, C and being able to do, I, I, I know a lot of people wh, who, F um, F um, I work parttime also, C and I a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home. F Um, C and they, they do a lot of volunteer work C and they're real active in the community C and, F um, they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working. C And I'd, I'd like to be able to do that. I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids. Yeah. Yeah, C but, I think that's for the, the few and far between. I think that, F uh, probably ninety percent of the, of the, F um parents out there are, are probably working parents. C And I, I don't, I don't really see that, that trend changing much, if anything, I think, there's going to be fewer and fewer, F uh, single income families. Yeah. Exactly. D See I, I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I, I never went to a day care center, I never, I never had that kind of experience. Yeah, I, I D see, it seems like that's, that's a big trend, D you know, in the last ten years. Day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, F um, a lot bigger part of, of the kids' lives. It's like a home away from home for a lot of them. Yeah, I, I think, D yeah I think this is a good closing point. D Well it was really nice talking to you. Thanks you too. F Uh, bye, byebye.
