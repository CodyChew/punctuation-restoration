<Talking> <<sounds like a radio>> All right. What have you seen? That's, I knew you were going to say that. I wanted, I want to go see that. Gosh. Yeah. I, I, I watched, F uh, Costner <<mispronounced>> on the Academy Awards. I was really happy that he got, I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor. F Uh, C but he, he, he did pretty good on that one. Yeah. Yeah, I'd, I bet. Yeah. There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see. F Uh, DANCES. F Uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. <Groan>. Nay. Nay. That's what people said, Yeah. Yeah. D Well, D you know, they, they, that's what they said about THE EXORCIST, D you know. No, no, it's terrible. You'll have nightmares, D you know. I watched last weekend. Me and my roommate. We, we laughed about it <laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, I'll tell, D well I guess, I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie. C And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was. Yeah. He's a very good writer C and he had a way of putting you in that scene, D you know. It was, Yeah. C And, of course, I was, I was living alone at the time C and it was late at night and scary C and, D you know <laughter>. You start hearing noises D you know. C And there's rats in the attic, D you know. F Uh, let's see. There was a couple of others that are out, C and I can't remember, Yeah. I, I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that. <Laughter>. No. I, I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway. Yeah. I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE C and then I, I know, I hardly ever go see a sequel. E I mean, I think, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. F Uh, TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better. TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book. Yeah. No, nobody could figure it out. E I mean the, the book was so much, F uh, there's just things, all you can do is put it in words. You can't put it in pictures. D You know, a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film, you co, say what is this? D You know, what's the significance of the apes, D you know <laughter>. F Oh, the book is really good. E I mean, I, I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again C and that's one of them. It's, it's so well written. F Oh, you're right. I haven't <laughter>. F Huh. F Oh, those a real dog and cat? F Huh. F Huh. So, sounds sort of like the incredible journey. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah. Th, that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film. Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film. F Oh, yeah. Not anymore. I mean, I, I, I was raised on Walt Disney films. D You know. OLD YELLER. F Uh, BIG RED. Yeah. When I was a little kid, I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve C and it was so good that I had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve. E I mean that's something for a kid. C And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, I'll tell you. No <laughter>. Is it? <Laughter>. Yeah. I didn't much care for the first one. Maybe that's, D Well, I, I'll have to go get that one I guess. Yeah. It's, it's, Yeah. I get so tired of, D you know, these, D you know, sequels. Number nine, number ten, number fourteen. Yeah, D you know. Yeah, D you know. FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD, D you know. I, I'm just, I'm so sick and tired of that. I just can't believe it. It's like ROCKY films. I I haven't seen a one. I can't stand Stallone. Yeah. C And I, I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do, D you know. Go into fourteen hundred episodes. <Ugh> Now I don't, I hardly ever watch T V. If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies C and I just, Yeah. I don't even rent them. D You know. I, I figure if I find a movie I like, I'll buy it. Cause I just watch them over and over again. Yeah. I, Yeah. My, my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is, F uh, EXCALIBUR. I, I loved that film. F Um, it's just so well done. C And I lived over in England for four years, That was the first place I ever saw it. C And it was just, gosh, it was so good. It was, it was filmed in Ireland. C And they got pretty scenery in Ireland. Yeah, it's nice. C And I, I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was. Yeah, it was, D yeah it was unimpressive to look at. E I mean, the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house <laughter>. Yeah. It wasn't, F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's some nice stuff over there to see. I, I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, D you know, hardly anything. I just, I need, to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel. Go around all the places. Stonehenge, of course, D you know. Every, everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge. Okay, big deal. Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field. Okay <laughter>. It's boring. <Laughter>. You know something, I, come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time. I, F uh, where I lived. F Uh, it was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London. C And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us. C And they had a little, F uh, theater company there C and we use to go, go out to that about once a week. Yeah. A really nice place. D You know, amateurs but really quite good. F Uh, C but that was interesting. Course go to London quite a lot and see shows down there. F Uh, C but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies, D you know. Never sho, any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted, I rented a lot of videos <laughter>. C Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds C and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies <laughter>. A lot of, a lot of people did. C But it would have to be a good show. Yeah. Yeah. I, I us, they, they, they have all these neat phrases. D You know, D you know, D you know. Like critically acclaimed. That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. D You know. They can't, Yeah, yeah. Yeah, from Love Canal <laughter>. Waterfront property here at Love Canal, D you know. C But, D you know, critically acclaimed. F Oh, good grief. Give me a break. That's wh, E I mean, there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies. C And primarily, E I mean, I, now I'm probably going to, going to upset you. C But people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me <talking>. <Children> Okay. The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES. F Oh, man. <Noise> <<sounds like water dripping>> I, I just finally ended up going to see it, F uh, C and <laughter> one day my husband had the kids C and I just went because we couldn't, we could never get to go see it together because it's so long. By the time we had a <laughter> babysitter for that long. C So I finally just went to see it. C And I just thought it was fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. That was quite a, <clicking> <<sounds like ping pong>> the buffalo scene in that thing was so real. It's like, <laughter> E I mean it just blew me away. Yeah. F Uh, I'm, I'm afraid to go see that one. That one looks so scary just, from the previews. I thought gosh I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months <laughter>. It's supposed to be good though. I know some friends who went to see it. They said it was really riveting. <Laughter> D Well, you're not a thirteen year old. I don't know. I saw it when I was a kid C and I thought, F oh, man <laughter>. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, really. F Huh. Gosh. F Oh, boy. <Laughter> Gosh. Call the crisis line. Yeah, I bet. F Oh, gosh. <Thumping>. I saw one I thought was crummy. With that new, F uh, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY. Where he plays a, a actor that's, F uh, D like th, F huh. F Oh, I know. It was, D well I ended up at the theater C and there was, didn't seem to be anything else on <laughter> I wanted to see, C so I'll try that. C But it wasn't worth anything. I didn't care <thumping> for that at all. Yeah. D Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals C and that was crummy also. I didn't think that was any good C so <child_talking>. Yeah. F Oh, boy. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I hadn't read it C and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time, C so <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. I should probably go back and read the book now <laughter> that I just saw the movie again not too long ago. Wow. F Huh. F Huh. D Well, I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO. <Noise> F Oh, that is, that is the most precious movie. It has, w, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life. C And it's all this, it's the story of this little cat and dog C and it's not <swallowing> D like cutesy. It's just, F uh, it's just so realistic. Everything they do. You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things. C And it was, A real dog and cat C and all the other animals. They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised. C And then the cat gets, F um, on this treacherous journey. He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river C and he winds up all over creation. I don't know where in the world it is. Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed. C But, F uh, it's just really an incredible thing. Yeah. It was pretty wild <laughter> C and. Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it. C But there's no, D you know, nothing else <laughter> to keep it going. C But it really keeps keeps me going. I, I've seen it twice now <laughter>. F Huh? Yeah. It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones. Walt Disney's kind of <thumping> gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years. Yeah. Yeah. All those old good ones that you, D you know, wish they had on more now, C but. F Oh, boy. F Huh. <Laughter> That's pretty good. Really. <Laughter> Let's see. What are some other ones I've seen lately. I'm trying to remember. I can't. F Oh, I just saw one on the video. F Oh, F um, have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO? That is a riot. Yeah. The first one was really good. C But the second one <laughter>, is really good too. I was really surprised. No, I thought it was funny. C But, that's my sense of humor <laughter>. <Thumping> It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore. C And I'm just, I guess I'm just middle America or something. I just go to be entertained C and C and not really interested in some of the, D like the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger <laughter> stuff. I just. Yeah. FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTYFIVE <laughter> or whatever. Yeah. I've never, <Laughter> <thumping>. Yeah. Yeah. I've never seen any of those. Yeah. I can't either. He seems so macho I just <ugh> <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can. You don't? <Laughter> That's like, my husband does that. He can watch them over and over. C And I'm, there's very few I would want to see that many times. C So he, he, once he has one he likes, he likes to watch it over and over. F Oh, yeah. That was a good one. I haven't seen that one in a long time. Yeah. <Screeching> F Oh, boy. Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh. F Huh. Yeah, I bet <dishes>. Gosh. F Oh, boy. C So, that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that. <Laughter> F Oh, really <laughter>. D Well, when I was in England years ago. C And I went to, to D like Shakespeare's and, D you know, StratfordOnAvon and all that <laughter> C and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it C because it was so short. The ceilings were so short. C But <sigh>. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, boy. <Dishes>. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter> Did you see any movies over there <laughter>? I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out. It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren C and that was a riot to see that. Yeah. Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie. F Huh. F Oh, boy <thumping>. Uhhuh. F Oh, boy. Yeah. That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh <laughter>. F Oh, boy. <Laughter> Probably some of them did <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore. C Because sometimes <dishes> the reviews you just can't go by. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, I see <laughter>. It's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're, D you know, if you're two miles away from water <laughter>. Water view <laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> <children> <noise>.
