Hi. You didn't try re, rewallpapering? You just, F uh, Did you use a textured paint C or, F Um. D Well, did you get good results? <Noise> <<Sounds like paper shuffling>>. Yeah. C But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it? <Noise> D Well, we did a, F uh, we moved, F oh, last August C and we're getting a house, my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den C and we decided, we went to, I've forgotten, one of the paint stores C and they just said, F oh, you can get by, C and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark. D Well, more or less. After about, F uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable C but it kept, the, the dark it was, F uh, just a real dark, F uh, wood grain type paneling C and it was smooth C and, F uh, C and we would, we put this stuff on C and, C and it supposedly textured it or did something to it C and, C but because of the b, dark behind it, it was really hard to cover C and <noise> <<sounds like pages turning>>, Yeah. It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it C because we were, D you know, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it C and we were painting it and trying to do, F uh, D you know, make it, C and it, it really was, D you know, the advice they give you is, F uh, the job was considerably tougher than we thought. F Uh, particularly when you try to, I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling C and, F uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate C and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling C and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something. Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted? Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, that's quite reasonable. . F Um, problem i, have you, have you tried matching paint lately? My wife, we, we built a shed over the long way, actually, it took, this is not on the topic C but I did finish it. C But my wife went to the, F uh, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, F uh, a copy, took a piece of brick C and she wanted to paint the shed it's, it's a wooden shed, F uh, C and she took it C and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint. C And, F uh, they got, C and, F uh, C and, in fact she put some right ba, she got, they mixed, F uh, a gallon of it C and, F uh, it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, F uh, C and it does it, F uh, F oh, electronically some, something, magic. Yeah, D you know, they, C but it's electronic. F Uh, you put your sample under this thing C and it looks at it in, and, F uh, and determines the, C and it, it's really remarkable. F Uh, the problem they had C and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim. C And, F uh, C but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, F um, that they could have taken a sample F um, from, I forgotten, this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something C but anyway. It's, it's remarkable. That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the, D you know, you want this, you want this to look like this C and you want that to look like that C and, of course, if it's all white you're all right C but when you start getting into colors, have you had problems getting colors to match? F Um. D So, Gosh. C So you, C so what's your, what's the solution then? F Oh, my <laughter>. D Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right? You could go back and, and paint, the whole thing over that's, F uh, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting C because it, F uh, it seems like everybody has a, D you know, to go in and do, I'll just do a little bit here and a little there. Although, the, F uh, it's F uh, it, we almost one day, we painted the house to, F uh, we painted, we painted the whole inside C and it had all this dark trim. We thought, F uh, D you know, we did the one wall but the other trim, I'm trying to think, I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, F uh, they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't, the mold, everything is white. In a new house everything is white. F Oh, good luck <laughter>. We wound up selling the house. Actually, I, I don't know whether it made, actually it does, it's interesting that the white, F um, makes the rooms look bigger. One of the, in our down stairs in our dining room A we have a formal dining room, it has molding, F uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that that actually, that are along the walls, D you know, up a couple of feet. C And my wife <noise> painted those, the insides of those dark blue. C And, F uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller. The trim, is still white. The, the molding C but by, C and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive, C but it makes the room look smaller which is, F uh F uh, which is, it explains why they, why they have everything white C but I, you wouldn't think that I, D well, maybe, maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff C but, F Uh, not particularly C because the house has so many windows F uh, it has the, the, the living room has four, F uh, good size windows C and, F uh, D well, of course, at night C but with the, we have, <laughter> we have a soccer field that's, F um, F oh, about a hundred yards from our house C and the lights shine right at our house. It's kind of, we didn't know that when we bought the house C but, Yeah. We have a lot of light, yeah. C And, D well, it, it, it, F um, D well, it's just, F uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white C so. Anyway, it didn't, it didn't change C but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't, it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're we're really on to that, that the masking is, you have to do that very, very carefully. That's right. You can work yourself to death. D Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend. It's kind of frustrating. D Well, I've got to go to a meeting. It's been good talking to you. Okay. Goodbye. <Children> <TV> <noise> <<kitchen>> Hi, F uh, as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, F uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom C and I had wallpaper up, I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that C and it took me all weekend C because, F uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down C and that had to dry. C And then the spackling had to dry a day C and then the painting took another day. No. I, I just painted. F Uh, no. Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth C so, I just used a, D like a semigloss. C And, D Well, no, not really. I need to, it, it looks so, bad you can see where those spackling marks were. I need to, F uh, either paper back over it or do something <sniffing>. Yeah. It covered the spots pretty good C but it didn't, E excuse me, it didn't, F uh, F uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Was it like a primer? Yeah. F Oh, my goodness, that's an awful lot. Not inside. D Now, F uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it. That was one of the requirements from, D you know, F H A that the house be painted before we bought it C and it was fairly reasonable. We have a brick house C but all the trim around the house was, F uh, if I remember right, <noise> it was like five hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah. C so that wasn't too bad. No, I haven't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh, C so, they did do a good job? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact, F uh, what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a, F uh, a blue C and the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match, D you know, it's the very same type of paint and everything, D So, F Oh, I have no idea. I repainted the whole thing. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. . White, yeah. That's what we're trying to get ours to look like. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. F Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim, what color? Okay. White. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. <Sniffing>. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, F uh, what about the lighting? Did it make a big difference? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. C So that, F uh, you get some, the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light. I see. Uhhuh. C And it takes a long time, Yeah. Really, no kidding. It is. A lot of work, a lot of work. Nice talking to you. Bye <Children> <TV> <noises> <<kitchen sounds in background>>.
