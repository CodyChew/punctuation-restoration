Ready to talk? Okay. F Uh, I want to talk about, F um, our family budget, and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and, give you a general description of it C and you can help me out a little bit. Tell me how yours works. D Well, at the my, I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we are, F uh, we're on the east coast now. My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that, D well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina. C And so naturally we put ourselves, we looked at our budget, C and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, F uh, was realistic. C And, F uh, C so, we had to make some adjustments C because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory, C and we've been here seven months C and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently. C So, you see, D Well, we actually planned for about one year. F Uh, that God because, it never occurred to <laughter>, it never occurred to us that it would take seven months. C And, F uh, what we did was just, F uh, decide wh, how we had been spending our money before, C and then we put that on the computer C and then we took about three months and, F uh, and adjusted, where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down, C and we really, F uh, lessened it, F uh, our living expenses, F uh, more than what we thought we would. C But, F Oh, just our own design. Uhhuh. C And the, D so, C but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, F uh, D you know, of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked <laughter>. We spent too much money, until our children went to college, C so. C So, tell me about, do you all, F uh, have a budget? Wonderful. Yes. Three and a two year old. Bang, bang. Uhhuh. D Well, I think that's important for your budget to be realis, for it to work though, you have to do something. Of course not. D Well, I found, F uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned, but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents. F Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish, gifts as, we had done before. C And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your <laughter> friends. Yes. D Well, I really do, I think you have to budget those things though. Yes. Exactly, although so much per month anyway. C And, F uh, that really should be in your bu, C but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month <laughter>. F Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't want the government to spend your money. You want to be able, D Well, F uh, C but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people, C and it was for us many years, for many years. F Uh, C and if, C and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I was just reading an article in, F uh, a North Carolina pap, paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, F uh, letters of applications to universities. She was o, she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty, C so, it can be done. Where there's a will, where there's a will, there's a way, right? <Laughter>. D Well, I have enjoyed talking to you. F Oh, I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard <laughter>. Byebye. I guess so <laughter>. Okay. Okay. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, no. That throws the budget out of whack real fast. F Oh, good. Really. That was smart. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Wow, that's great. Did you have a special program on your computer to do that C or was this just your own design of, Uhhuh. Gosh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, we've been married for five and a half years C and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot <noise>, more fun kinds of of things and, F uh, did really, F um, D you know, have a real strict budg, E but, budget C but, F uh, the about and to our, wh, wh, wh, wh, when we first got married we were in graduate school C and we were just, D you know, dirt poor. Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. C So, we virtually did that for about two years, which worked real well, and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway <laughter> no matter how much we saved, and moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, D you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market, C so, I don't know if we, <laughter> we did a good thing to buy a house or not C but at least we've got a place to live. F Um, C so, now, since, F uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, F um, Uhhuh. That's, that's, that threw our budget really <laughter> out of whack too. An we, F um, have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids. C And, F um, we just really have, F uh, <breathing> I don't know, we, we've tried different times, we've done D like a survey of D like taking, D you know, the past three months of where all the money went. C And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all, C but it seems like there's, F um, times when we just have to get out where we'll go and D like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow, D you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing something, D you know. Yeah, that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week C and then it's not really that realistic C because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, D you know, birthday for somebody C or, D you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids, we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, D you know, whether they're JORDACHE new or whether they're <laughter>, D you know, something C and they're both boys C so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes, D so. C But, F um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, F um, D you know, budgeting and some extra things, D you know, for, that are more, D you know, nonessential items. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> On your friends, that's true, that's true. D Well, we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with, we both have older cars C and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars, D you know, on the car in two months or something, C and, D you know, a lot of things like that that really ar, are hard to plan for. C And, F uh, Yeah, kind of put in a certain amount per year, you're going to have on extra expenses for car. Yeah, yeah. Yeah <laughter> our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, F um, D you know, is to, let's see, D now, I forget which way we do it. We don't list all the deductions C and then we get more money back, D you know, at the end of the year, C so, that's not a good way to <laughter>, <Laughter> that's what my husband said, C so this last year he changed it, of course, we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back C and it was like oh, no. Better find another way of saving money <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, C because we don't miss it, we really don't, when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff, C so. C But we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can en, envision the, F uh, expenses for college already, D you know, <laughter> eighteen years away or whatever. Gosh. I guess, that's fantastic. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, I enjoyed talking to you too, good luck C and don't spend any money this weekend <laughter>. F Oh, boy. Bye.
