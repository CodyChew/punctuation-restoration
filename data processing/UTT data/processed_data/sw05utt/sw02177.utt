Cindy, have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES? F Oh, that is a wonderful movie. No. F Oh goodness no. You don't even, you don't even realize it, D you know. Really. F Oh, I thought it was great. Yeah. D Well, yeah, C and I heard a story about there's a, there's a certain scene in the movie where there's, F um, where they're, they're on a buffalo hunt. C And they have a particular child actor, F uh, who's, who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo. C And when they were trying to film that, the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo. I can't remember what they said his name was. C But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies. <Laughter> C And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies <laughter>. <Laughter> I thought that was really funny. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, the wagon, the wagon driver. Yeah. C And, F uh, the costuming D yeah, was, the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't, that, that, F um, the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things. C And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age, to age the material D so, they, they did very authentic reproductions of the, of the actual stuff, C but they didn't, they didn't age it quite enough it seemed. C But it was a very good movie. What have you seen lately? F Oh, I didn't see that. I don't, I don't like Stephen King. Really. I wasn't sure, C because, F uh, just generally, D you know, that kind of scary stuff I, I just don't want to have anything to do with it. Yeah, I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something, D you know. F Um. Ugh. Yeah. It still just seems a little twisted to me <laughter>. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I know, we don't see movies at the movies a lot. The last, we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES C and we went to see NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER, C but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape, C and then we rent them <laughter>. F Oh, yeah that looks really good too. And SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I'm, I'm intrigued by it, C but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet <laughter>. I think, F uh, D well, D now, we had some friends that went to see it C and they said it was okay. C So, it might not be as, I think they may be playing up F um, some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects. D Now, we went to see the JAGGED EDGE. Yeah. C So, it's, it seems like, D you know, that kind of the thriller suspense and not, not real, F um, strange in other ways. Okay. <laughter> Maybe we'll talk to you again. Alright. Byebye. No, I haven't. Have you? Uhhuh, it's not, the length isn't too long? Uhhuh. F Uh. D Well, we all heard different opinions about it. F Uh, Uhhuh, one that, D you know, yeah, it was too long C and they thought that, D you know, at certain points that it was going to end, C and it didn't, C and it kept going on C and, uhhuh. Really. D Now, I've seen, D you know, some different clips of it, F um, C and it, it looks good, it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately <laughter> <static>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, oh <laughter>, Hey, that'd work for me, let me tell you <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Now I've seen another clip of, F um, the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN, I don't know his name, C but he played the, F uh, the, the character in it that was very, D like, gross, E I mean, very dirty, C an, F Oh, I saw the one clip of him C and ugh, it was first, I guess he was taking Kevin Costner to D like the site where he was going to be or whatever. That was rather, F um, gross <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. C But other than that I've heard the, the, D you know, the, F um, <<pause>> the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful. Uhhuh, really. F Oh really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. The styles, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I guess I will have to see it then. F Um, actually have been to the movies, F um, I think the last movie I saw was MISERY. F Oh, very suspenseful. I really don't either, C but I went with someone, C and once I was there, I couldn't believe. E I mean, it's an excellent movie. Yeah. It's not necessarily, it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful. E I mean it's not. No, in, in the book apparently she cuts his feet off, C but in the movie she, she disables him, but not by cutting his feet. F Um, she, she breaks both of his ankles. C And that I couldn't watch, C and, C but, D you know, you could tell when it was coming. C So yeah, F um, that was so that he couldn't leave her, C cause she, Yeah, yeah E I mean, Yeah, well, as far as that goes, yeah, E I mean, you wouldn't like to see anybo, anything happen to anybody, C but it was just how she got so caught up, her emotions C and, D you know, C and, C and she feel madly in love with this writer. C And there was this, C but she was a killer, C and the, the character was, D you know, prior to that had, had been someone that had killed other people C but no one knew that. D So. C But. C So, yeah, we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately, Uhhuh. Right, right. Now I want to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. F Uh yeah, that looks good. C And there were a couple others that I just haven't had the time. D Now D see I. Yeah, I don't think I want to see that either. I know, I don't think I could. Really. Really. Uhhuh . F Oh, I liked that movie. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, F um. <<pause>> D Well, I guess that's about it. It was nice. Okay, it was nice talking to you. Byebye.
