tell me what you think about the Vietnam war. F Uh, as I understand it, A C and I, F uh, <barking> don't know a lot about it, F uh, we got in there because of <barking> France F uh, France was there first. They had, Sure. Jerry, what did you think of people like, F uh, Jane Fonda, another war an, antiwar activist. Right or wrong? Uhhuh. F Uh, D you know, I, I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that. I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they decided to pull out C and, Sure. Sure <clicking> <beep>. <<Talking to someone else or himself.>> Wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something. F Huh, fascinating. Well that's not, That's okay. F Um. No, I had thought that they had, F uh, colonies there, or something. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'm thirtytwo, C so, F uh, I bar, D well, I missed it. Seventyfour is when they quit sending troops. Yeah. I was just probably three or four years, Okay. D Well, I'm a Vietnam era veteran, C and, F uh, I was, F uh, fortunate not to have to serve in the theater, however, my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation. F Uh, I'm of the old school that believes that, F uh, the, F uh, F uh, contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored. However, F uh, I think we could have executed the war C and gotten it over a whole lot quicker. F Uh, C but those are my personal thoughts, C and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people. C But as it was, the politicians ran the, the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing, C and we managed to come out, F uh, losers all the way around. C And C so this is what trigger, ultimately triggered us, F uh, United States, F uh, per se, being, F uh, deciding to get out of the role of world policeman. Your views, D Well. We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, <noise> F uh, we pledged a mutual, F uh, F uh, defense of, of the South Vietnamese, C and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another, C and really we <laughter> <noise> I, I question us, D you know, now, of course hindsight is all too clear. F Uh, C so, we're, we, we have to, have to deal with, with the, F uh, situation as, as we played it. I, <laughter> don't get me started on those people. D You know, before she, before Jane Fonda did, did what she did, I thought she was a wonderful person, C but after, F uh, F uh, D well, I, I just don't have anything, want anything to do with her any more, C because you support, F uh, you support your government. F Uh, okay, right or wrong, I don't think is, is, we can determine whether we were right or wrong, C because, you're, you're having to deal with, again, F uh, I think we could have made a different agreement back in for, the for, the late forties era that would have kept of there. Can you hold just a second, Terry? One moment please. Sorry for the delay. F Uh, yeah, this is, the, F uh, the, the, F uh, mutual defense thing was, F uh, we, we, it was complicated, C and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation. I don't. C But from what I can gather, is we went and said yeah, we will help the South Vietnamese, F uh, should they ask. D Well, the French went in and tried their old style warfare, and, F uh, got soundly thrashed. C And we didn't do a whole lot better. D Well, yeah, that was the old French colony, but see, the French, the French were our, F uh, allies in NATO C and they're also our allies in SEATO, which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which has since been, F uh, disbanded as far as I know, D you know, NATO is, is on the way of being disbanded. F Uh, C but, F uh, the, D you know, the French, D yeah we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah, we'll, we'll help you out, if you get in a bind. D Well, they got in a bind and says we don't want to, D you know, play any more C so, F uh, we, we kind of, we kind of got, got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi, F uh, F um, F oh, operations and then the full scale, D you know, full scale troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. F Uh, yeah, yeah roughly.
