This is Archie. Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES? Have you ever lived in that part of the country? Have you ever visited it? I think it was the black hills of South Dakota. D Well, I lived in Omaha for five, winters, C and that rolling kind of, F uh, Yeah. Is, is fairly famili,. The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics, apparently it's going to win everything. F Uh, C and I had been told, D you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of, D Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that, C and I, I, I tend to, I think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great. C And, C and it was, the thing is, it was, it was a good story. C And, C and, C and I guess that's what I really like. Although, I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour. Yeah. No. I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though. No, You must really keep up. D Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a, i, is it, is it a terror movie C or is it just suspenseful? Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill? Is, F uh, do you know who he is? He's a, the movie critic. F Um, F oh, you've, F oh, okay. He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas. C And he does, F uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F. Anyway, it's on from seven to nine, or something. C And, C and, C and people call in C and it's, if you keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting. There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do. They've got, F uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or twelve years old, C and they call in C and they review movies. C But it's, F uh he, anyway, he, it's interesting. You listen to him C and then you, you go watch the movie. In fact, they had, people had just seen, I was listening Sunday night a little bit when, I was going to pick up my daughter. C But, anyway, it was, F uh, the, it, it's interesting, though, the, the difficulty with, with DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that, and you produce it, and then you star in it, F uh, the question is, did he, did he really know it was going to be good C or did he just do it? Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, F uh, the, the wagon driver? A little piece of trivia. D You know, the guy when he first headed out from the army post. He, he plays <laughter> on MURPHY BROWN. Yes. He's, he's Eldon, her housepainter. <Laughter> Can you, believe that? That's, <laughter> that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said, did you notice that? I thought, no, it's really funny. C But I thought, it, it, you think back, C and yeah, it was him, but with a D you know, with the beard and all that stuff. E I mean, it's, F uh, Yeah. Real scruffy looking, C and it wa, it was really funny, it's, F uh, that, that he winds up <laughter> playing in the movie. C But I thought, it's good that, D you know, it was a lot of fun. I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go C but we're at about five minutes. I should think we've done enough. D Well, I don't know. Why do we end this thing? I think it just says hang up. <Laughter> Why don't we do that? Goodbye Sharon. Hi, Archie. I'm Sharon. Yeah. I've seen that, that's, F uh, that was a really good movie. Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery C and, F uh, I thought the story was pretty good, too. I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it. No. I haven't. F Um, I've visited the Wyoming area. I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed. Could be. I, n, I haven't been to South Dakota. Have, have you been up to that? Oh. Okay. Terrain. Really? That's true. I agree with that. F Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it, I think it's been nominated for twelve awards C and, C and all the critics initially said that, D you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was just going to be a dud. C So, it, it has surprised everybody. Uhhuh. Right. Did you? Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? Y, you have to go see that one. C And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB? Go. I do. I go every weekend <laughter>. I, I, F uh, those are two definite must see movies, I think. It's suspenseful. I don't think it's very t, E I mean, there's not really any, F uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that. It's, it's more suspense. F Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff. It's, it's pretty graphic at points. C But, F uh, I think they're both excellent movies. No. D Huhuh. Yeah. Somebody in South Carolina told me about him. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. I think that, I think he really, his heart was in it, C but I, I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was. I think it was something that he really wanted to do. He wanted to direct it, he wanted to, to star in it. D You know, he, he enjoyed the story line C and I think he just really w, he really wanted it. C And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy. C Because I think that, I think he did a good job C and, C and the selfsatisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him. <Lipsmack> F Um. Yeah. Who, no I don't know who that guy is. F Oh, he does? As a recurring character every week? Oh. No, D now D see, I'd, I'd a never put those two together. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah, real scruffy looking <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. You think so? E I mean, I haven't been watching my watch. F Um, <static> I guess, yeah. Does it usually cut off? Is that what, it does? It used to, it used to just automatically cut off C but it says when the conversation is over just say your goodbyes and hang up. C So, I, I guess so. Okay. Good talking to you Archie <static>.
