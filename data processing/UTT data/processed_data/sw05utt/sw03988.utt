favorite type of music or musician or any. Do you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I, I'm very, F uh, I'm very varied as well. I, F uh, I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, F uh, maybe, D you know, heavy metal and that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't enjoy rap too much, either. That, that doesn't appeal to, F uh, my ears. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh. Uhhuh uhhuh, yeah, sure. D Well, F um, I listen to, F uh, specific, most, most likely I would be listen to, F uh, jazz or classical music. F Um <throat_clearing>, I, in college I took, F uh, four years of classical guitar, C and I played in the, in the jazz combo all four years. I play guitar for the jazz combo. C So, F uh, <throat_clearing> that's where my two, my two listening enjoyments are, C but, D you know, jazz can get on my nerves after a while. F Uh, you can't just listen to it, D you know, to, F uh, especially a lot of the deeper stuff, you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're. D Yeah, unless, unless you're playing it, it just, it just doesn't do anything. F Uh, F uh, blues are okay. I, I tell you, I do like, F um, I grew up on blue grass music. My dad is a big blue grass fan, C and so F um, <throat_clearing> I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school C but, <Laughter> I really do like it a lot. <sniffing> C So. No, it doesn't, it doesn't. Yeah, F uh <sniffing>, they've all got, D you know, the real screechy electric guitars now. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I, yeah, I grew up on him. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, do you? Yeah, you sure do. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, they're great aren't they. Yeah. Yeah, it sure is, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I like his, he has a nice smooth voice. Yeah, sure. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, something like that, it was last, last, last year wasn't it. <Laughter>. I don't really have a favorite type. I like, F uh, a lot of different types of music. Yeah, I have a, a tape collection that I like to listen to, F uh, cassette tapes C but it's pretty varied. Yeah. How about you? That's exactly me. The acid rock or the heavy metal. Even some of that I like okay but not, mostly, as a general rule, I don't care for that at all. D Well, as far as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves C and I like some of their songs. C But as, as I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either. C But I, I like to listen to, F uh, what you might call pop, easy listening country western, jazz <laughter> F uh, classical, F um, I, I don't, I like, F uh, like I said, pretty varied, F uh, music. I have a couple that my husband really hates <Laughter> that I listen to, like Billy Holiday I really love to listen to her, C and, F uh, I even have a, a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo <laughter> C and, D well, E I mean, they're very harmonic they really are. C So, they're interesting to listen to. You might try that. How about you? F Oh, yeah? It's too, F um, F uh, you have to concentrate on it, it seems. <Laughter> What about the blues or something like that? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. I, I like some of it, F um, as far as D like the cou, what they now call country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it? F Um, some of it sounds more like pop music. F Oh, n, yeah, I don't care for that. If I'm going to listen to today's country western, I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black C and I even liked Jim Reeves D you know C or, F uh, what, what Merle Haggard and Faron Young that type of country western is what I, I like to listen to. Asleep At The Wheel. F Uh, Sons of the Pioneers, D you know, stuff like that. F Um, F oh, I like sound tracks a lot. Yeah, it seems like you get a lot of original music that way. E I mean, D you know, think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent things like that I like to listen to. F Um, I like instrumental things. F Um, I have some Spiro Gyro tapes. F Oh, they're wonderful. I love them. I have some dulcimer music. I mean, like I said, that, that's pretty varied. Al Jarreau, he's somebody I like. He's pretty, kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop, too. F Oh, yeah, C and, D you know, what I like the most about him, is, A I've gone to see him in concert, C and he always, he looks like he's having fun. E I mean, some people sing, and they have their faced all contorted, like it hurts them or something <laughter>. C But he looks like he's having a good time. E I mean, he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and, and like all he wants to do is, is make the audience enjoy it, too. C And he, he is real fun to listen to. F Um, Bonnie Rait, I like her a lot. F Um, in fact, whenever she won her big Grammy I think it was like five of them or something was, was it five, C or. Yeah, last year or the year before, I can't remember, C but, F um, I was listening to a particular radio station C and, C and the one D J said, who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies? D Well, I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that <laughter> radio station any more, if that D J can make such a unedu,
