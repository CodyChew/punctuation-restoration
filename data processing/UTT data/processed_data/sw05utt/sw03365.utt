Hi, Donna. Ready to get started? Okay. <beep> Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here <laughter>. F Oh, it was, F uh, <laughter> it was, I'm an officer in the Air Force, C and we went to the Officers' Club for a little Mexican food *slash error with utt2 today. Yeah. Yeah. If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve? Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Jeez, D well, D well, when is the party here? <laughter>. I don't know being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I don't think I'd, I'd be a, b, E I mean it, it's not a question of capability here to do something like that. It's just there's, there's no motivation. D You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that C but, F um, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what they, they are shooting for here. D Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here, C and, F uh, C so it, C and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors, D like that's a little more a casual thing. C But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that C so we, sort of, a, really good place to do entertaining like that. I just haven't, F uh, really tried a whole lot C but, F uh I don't know, let's see. I have had, D well, one time I did have a dinner party. I served a, F uh, F uh, I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern, F uh, southern food even though I'm up here in New York, C so <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is. It's, F Oh, no kidding? Upstate. Rome. In, F uh, Griffins Air Force Base. D Well, I was born in Buffalo, C and, F uh, been all over the place. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I've been down to Texas a few times, and, F uh, had, F uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Hi, this is Donna Donahue. Hi. F Uh, yeah, I think so. Okay. D Well, what did you have for lunch? Oh. Oh. D Well, that's interesting. Okay. C So our topic is, is food today, is that, Okay. Okay, <lipsmack> F uh, do you want me to go first? Okay. If I was having a dinner party I would probably, F um, have some, F um, some, F uh, F um, some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, F um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, F uh, F uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts. C And then I would have, F um, let's see. I usually have D like a little theme when I have a dinner party C so. F Um, I would have maybe, F um, say if it was D like Greek night or something F um, maybe, F um, <lipsmack> on the barbecue we'd put, F uh, cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek. And, F um, D like a shish kabob, and, F um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions C and then we'd have, F um, <lipsmack> D like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad. C And, F um, let's see what else. F Um, maybe some rolls and, F um, I guess some, F uh, some rice or something like that. How does that sound? <laughter>. Yeah. <laughter> F Um, yeah, that would take some planning C but, That's right. D Well, that sounds good too. I have, F um, I have three kids C so, F um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of babysit for the little two younger ones upstairs C and, F um, usually we just have very plain kind of, D you know, interesting, not very interesting meals. Pizza and that all C so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun, C but it's not a, not a regular thing. <laughter> F Um, D Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes, is that it? Okay. Okay. F Um, let's see now wh, okay, D so you would have a barbecue wouldn, Uhhuh. F Oh, sure. Uhhuh. F Oh, that sounds wonderful. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, you are in New York right now? Oh. I'm, I'm in Texas. I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country. F Oh, I see. C And I'm fr, originally from Long Island. Yes, C and D now where are you in New York? F Oh, upstate. F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. Is that where you, you are originally from around there? F Oh, okay. F Oh, wow. That's interesting. Okay, let's see. F Um, D well, I like to have, F um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, F um, everybody bring something, C and that's real interesting because then you get different, F um, different kinds of foods and new recipes C and, F um, F uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like, C and get the recipe from them or whatever. C And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food C because here in Texas they have lots of, really good Mexican restaurants C and, F um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could, do you know what a fajita is? Yeah. Okay. Yes. They have some delicious, delicious things, C and I, F um, since I always make chicken burritos and just take chicken breasts C and you boil them, maybe like four chicken breasts, C and you boil them until they are cooked. Maybe like thirty minutes C and then you debone them and, and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled C and you take, F um, s, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr, in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt,
