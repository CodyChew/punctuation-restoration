What are you guys having for Christmas? F Oh, you're not. Yeah. D Well, funny you should mention that. I'm a pig farmer <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, D now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else, C but we're going to have, F uh, wild boar we, F uh, we killed a boar the other day, it was, D you know, mating with the sows, C and you can't use the piglets, D you know, C so. It's about six months of no use, C so, we, F uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, D you know, processed into ham, C and, F uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia C and rather than, D you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him <laughter>. D Well, no, D hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap, I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken. Yeah, you just, F uh, you kill him, D you know, you probably, most guys just shoot them in the head, they go, D you know, in a second they're gone C and then you just dip the carcass in, F uh, boiling water, pull it out, A C and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, F uh, gut it, and, F uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, F uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, D you know, sliced them up, and, F uh, cover him up with, F uh, wet, F uh, sacks, A feed sacks is what I usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him. C And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there, C and it's the best eating you ever had. Yep, just like a pig E I mean, D you know, F uh, it has a lot less fat. This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds C and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds. D Well, D you know, we took the skin and the head and the le, and the feet off, C and that was about, D you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham. F Oh, D well, we're, D you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing <laughter>. It would take a year. C But, F uh, D you know, we're going to drive up to Kansas City, see my wife's folks, C and, F uh, she, she, what's, what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas <talking>, yeah, D well her mom's doing brisket. Brisket? It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away. It's just tough as a boot C and, F uh, D you know, they used to use it for leather, I think <laughter>. E I mean, no, I was kidding. C But, F uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, D you know, the rib cage, C and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs, C so it's really, really a tough piece of meat C but it's so tasty, you can't stand it. C So you just take it C and you marinate it for a couple of days . C And then, F uh, you just put it in the oven, takes about four hours to cook one. They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds. C And, F uh, we're going to have that. F Oh, D well, we'll have cranberries and hominy C and, F uh, we, we are, we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here. We have oliv, olives, black olives and cucumbers and, F uh, tomatoes, we still have tomatoes yeah, fresh tomatoes. <Laughter> D Well, it started to freeze up around here, D you know, there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down. E I mean it's thirty degrees this morning. Yeah. C But, F uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost. F Oh, yeah. D Well, it's desert, D you know, where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, F uh, the edge of the desert, E I mean, it's part of the Great Plains. C So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten C and at night it goes down to about sixty. Yeah, we get a fifty de, degree temperature swing in about four hours. C So everything that lives around here is real tough <laughter>. That's trees, D you know, we got hundred year old trees that are, D you know, twenty feet tall. That's all the bigger they get, they, D you know, they're just hard as a rock. <Throat_clearing> What are we having? Let's see <laughter>. D Well, I'm not planning the menu. No <laughter>. We usually go out to ei, either one of our folks, they both live close to C but, F um, I don't know, it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham. F Oh, you are F huh. My goodness. F Huh. F Oh, really. Is that, is that hard? <Laughter>. F Oh, really. Oh. Huh. F Oh, my goodness. F Oh, D well, does a boar taste just like regular ham? Does it. F Huh. Oh my. F Oh, my goodness. F Oh, D well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas? Eat it all, yeah <laughter>. I don't, what is brisket? D Huh. Oh. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, my goodness. F Huh. C And that softens it up, huh. F Huh. F Oh, gee. D Well, <throat_clearing> what else do you serve with your pig? F Huh. F Oh, do you? F Oh, we, we just got lots of snow <laughter>. F Oh, really. F Huh. F Oh, my goodness. I didn't know it got that low at night. F Oh, gee. My goodness. F Oh, boy. F Oh <laughter>. F Oh, gee.
