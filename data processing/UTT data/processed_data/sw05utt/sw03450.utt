D Well, F uh, guess it's logical to ask, do you exercise any? I'm about the same way, I, I do a little bit. My job kind of hinders me from exercising. I'm a night operator here at a industry down here C and I don't really get out a lot to, because my job, to, to exercise. Right. It is. That's, that's the way I feel. I'm used to being in pretty good shape because when I was in high school I stayed in pretty good shape, played a little basketball and stuff like that, C but I've got, now, I'm in college C and I go to school during the day and work at night. I can tell that I've not really done a whole lot. D Well, F uh, I usually, I usually play at home. We live out in the country C so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play C or a lot of times we're, we're up at the church we'll play volleyball stuff like that. F Oh, really? F Oh, the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES? F Oh, really? Right. Right. I'll, F Oh, really? Right, that's the way I am. I just want to sit down and relax. Too tired to exercise. I did. I started riding my bike about a couple of months ago C and I'd ride about two or three miles a day, C but, C but it would last about a couple of weeks C and it got real cold for a little while C so I gave it up. Walk around. Right. Right, I've noticed people doing that down here, too. I'll be in town or something C and people will walk around the mall. It, it is fairly safe. <Laughter> Yeah, certain parts of it. Right. Right, I used to do a lot of swimming, we have, we have a swimming pool, C but it's an old concrete pool. We've been having trouble with it the past few years, C so we haven't got to use it much, C but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that. Right. Right, you can't do it year round. Right, that's the way ours is. <Laughter>. F Oh, no, it's too cold. <Laughter> I could deal with a hot tub. Those are nice. I'm from Laurel. That's way down towards the south. Not quite on the coast, C but we're about two hours from the coast. Yes, ma'am, it, it started about yesterday, I believe. It started raining and got real cold. Oh. Right. D Well, unfortunately very little. F Uh, much less than what I need to. D Well, I, F uh, am an assistant teacher and, F uh, in business technology C and I've, I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions. It keeps me pretty busy, C but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going. C And, F uh, D you know, it really, exercise is so important. C And I realize that. When you, F uh, exercise, what do you do? Do you do it at home or a club C or, I got a hold of, F uh, Richard Simmons' tape, F uh what is it, F uh, I can't even think of the name of it right offhand, with the oldies. Sweating with the, to the oldies, yeah C and that's not bad. That's pretty upbeat, C so, D you know, I, every once in a while I'll put the cassette in and go with it. Not often enough to have a routine <laughter>. My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her. C But, F uh, I don't know, by the time I get home, all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer C and my fingers exercise more than anything now. Yes. F Uh, do you ever ride a bike or anything like that? Here, about the, the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk, F uh, Because they're enclosed C and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and, and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter. C And it's safe. That's, F uh, D you know, inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage <laughter>. I know a doctor once told me it, it, a friend of mine, F uh, suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is. The, F uh, swimming, they say, uses more muscles than any other exercise with, C and the water takes the resistance. Right, C and you don't get the soreness. I've, I've done some water exercises, C but our pool is not, is not heated C so it's, Summertime only. You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees, go out to the swimming pool. Hot tubs are not, F uh, not too bad, C but <laughter>. D So, what part of Mississippi are you from? Whereabouts is that? Oh, C and you do have cold weather down there? Ours started Thanksgiving. C And, F uh, from there just, F well, today was pretty, C but, F uh, F oh, Sunday the snow and ice came in. C And, F uh, there was no exercise.
