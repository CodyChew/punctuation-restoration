What are your favorite shows? Uhhuh. I've never seen that. Huhuh. <Laughter>. F Um, I like L A LAW not because it's realistic, but <laughter> it's entertaining. F Um. Let's see. I watch CHEERS sometimes. And, mostly just movies, when there's a good movie on. D Actually when there isn't a good movie on, too. I just like to have the T V on if, D you know, if I'm home alone or something have, either the radio or the T V s got to be on <laughter>, the whole time. F Oh, really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, D well, I don't, because I work all day. C But, F um, I pro, I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, D like, D you know, around Christmas or whatever, after a while I'll start watching it C and then on, for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened C and then I'll just forget it. F Uh, I don't even remember the last time I watched was back in college. It was D like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something C and I maybe watched it for a week C but, F um, I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the, D you know, they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera. It was a, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, you said you have kids. How old? C So, you're, you aren't a SESAME STREET fan? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Supposed to be a great babysitter <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. I know, what time is that on, I never see it? F Oh, okay. I'm not home then, that's why I don't see it. <Laughter>. Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange <laughter>? Uhhuh, uhhuh. What's that? Yeah, D well, I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us, C but <laughter>. D Well, tell me, is it snowing up there? No. Uhhuh. Wow. C But do you have snow on the ground now? Oh. D Well, that's nice. F Oh, gosh, we've broken all sorts of records. They've got, E I mean, we still have some highways closed, C and it stopped raining almost twentyfour hours ago. C But, F um, F oh, just phenomenal, E I mean, I, D you know, you see it on the news all the time, C but until you've really seen it, it does, it doesn't really hit you. C But I was driving home from work Friday, C and I saw, there were some stop signs, E I mean, submerged up to the writing on the stop sign, C and that was just it was amazing to me. D So. F Oh, there's been a lot, yeah. It's, it's too bad C but D you know, the thing is that this happens, in the last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood <laughter> zones. C So, I don't know. E I mean, you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for. I don't think I would. C Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood. Yeah. Yeah, I do, yeah. Have you made a lot of calls C or, Uhhuh. Oh. Do you get paid for these? Five dollars a call? Gosh, I wish I could do that <laughter>. We can't get paid for it. D Well, <laughter> I, it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V, C but the ones that are out now. I, I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times. I think that's kind of a good show. Haven't you? F Oh. I like that one, C and, F um, I'm trying to think. I, I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch. How about you? F Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh. I do like that. Yeah, occasionally I'll see that one. Do you? Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, F uh, F oh, I do, I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately. I've, D well, I've been home with a, F um, I have a baby, C and C and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much, C and C so I'll, I'll watch a soap occasionally. Do you watch any of those? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh what, what ones do you get into? F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. How funny, F oh, yeah. F Oh, I don't get into them that much. When I'm home, sometimes in the day I'll I'll watch them C but, D yeah, F oh, I was really trying to think. I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else. F Oh, I have a six year old, C and I have a, F um, he'll be a year old in January. D Well, they do, they watch it. My six year old's kind of, he's outgrown that one a little bit, C but C but, I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby, C and he's kind of, he's entertained by it. C So, yes, I, I do watch that one. Yeah, D well, they're not entertained for too long with it. He's, he's still too little, C but yeah, I do turn that on. C And I, I do like, F um, DONAHUE. Sometimes I watch that. I think he has some interesting things on it. F Um, that's on at, let's see, it's on at four. Yeah, I'll watch that occasionally. He's got some real, I don't know, there's some real weird people that, he seems to come up with. Yes. Yeah, F oh, yeah. . He does have some real bizarre things, I think. C So, other than that, I don't know. Guess I'm not much of a T V person really. F Um, no. It snowed a little bit, F um, probably about four days ago C and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas. Yeah there is snow on the ground. I, I wish it would snow a little bit more. I've heard it's raining there. F Oh really. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah. F Oh, goodness. F Oh, gee D so. C So there has been some flooding C and, . Uhhuh. F Oh, gee. Yeah. F Oh, boy. Yeah, F oh, what a mess. D Well, D now, do you work for T I? F oh, uhhuh. F Huh. D Well, this has been an interesting thing to do. F Um, I've, I've probably talked maybe to five people. My husband is doing it too, C and he's talked to a few more than me, C and, C but it's been real interesting and kind of fun. F Um, five dollars. Uhhuh. F Uh, don't you have to do it as part of its, Don't you have to do it,
