Okay, what do you like to cook? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That would be good for a dinner party, that, D you know, to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things, coming out at once. Is that what you usually cook when you have a party. Uhhuh. Really, that sounds good. F Um, fattening <laughter>. F Uh, we, it's funny that, F um, we're talking about this, we just had a dinner party C and we had, F um, our senior pastor and his wife came over. C And I catered to their diet is the only thing, though, C so it wasn't something I really wanted to make. I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with. D you know, sausage, C because I'm from New Orleans originally. C And, F um, I was going to make that, red beans and rice with the, those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff, C and, F uh, D well there's salad C and then for desert I would, I really wanted to make, F um, just brownies C or French donuts would have been good, C but it's real hard to make them. They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here, I don't know why. I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have C but, F um, that's what I want. That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that C but. Kind of like the Italian, it's really good, C but instead I catered to their diet C so I made baked chicken in the crock pot C and, F um, it was good and everything, it had all the vegetables in it, C but, it seemed kind of boring compared <laughter>, Right. I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain, C because I guess, I guess I feel like if they're on a diet like that, I'm going to, D you know, honor that, C but if it's just another couple came, F um, over a couple weeks later C and I made, what did I make that night. I made a roast, C and I made, F um, F uh, I can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday. I can't believe that. Anyway, C but I asked, when Ricky and Carrie came over we made, F um, a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit. C And normally I, don't eat, we don't eat like that during the week because of the, D you know, the calories and the fat in it. C But D you know, when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it. C And I made blueberry cobbler <laughter> C and we had extra crust with it, it was so fattening. C But, I don't think we gained any weight from it C so. Right, I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over C and she didn't eat it. C But I did bake apples so that it would be, not brownies, D you know. I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies. C So, F um, I've read a good brownie recipe. C But, F uh, anyway, C so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained. C So, do you have anything else you want to say about it? Okay, D well it was nice talking to you. Okay, bye. I like, D well I like to cook foods I like to eat. I like to eat Italian food best. C And I find that I, that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals, type things and, they're kind of convenient. Right. F Um, I usually have parties that are smaller groups. I don't have, I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such. C And so, F um, yeah, I guess I usually do. I like to cook, F um, heavy sauces, and, F um, noodles and pasta and such. Yeah, actually <laughter>. How about you, what do you like to, to cook? Uhhuh. F Oh yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh really. Humidity or something. Uhhuh. It kind of, F uh, kind of down played compared to what you would like, huh. Do you find yourself, F um, with all the, F um, cholesterol and, and high fiber changing the way that you fi, that you entertain? Uhhuh. F Oh no. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That sounds good. D Well, every once in a while I, I think I feel the same way. When I'm entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really, really, D like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories, C so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play, sometimes. F Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh. F Um, nothing comes to mind right off, C so I guess not. Okay you too. Bye, bye.
