D So the general topic is hobbies. Let's hear about your hobbies. Any handicrafts? Any handicrafts? D So, F um, I think I'm in handicraft. I think it will become resume writing. F Uh, yeah, I, I hate to think about it C and, C and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads. Yeah, it, it, I <breathing>, who knows. No, all means about fifteen to twenty percent, of, of, F oh, I'm sure the numbers s, somewhere classified C but some of the internal news and the news services, C so, it's approximately six fifty, C so ten percent of six fifty, is sixtyfive C and twenty percent would be one thirty. Yeah, that's possible. F Oh, yes,. F Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring. Yes. Yeah, F uh, no, Apple's coming to town C and, C and that has some opportunities C and, F uh, C and, Colorado Springs specifically, yes. C And, F uh, C and, F uh, M C I s coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag. Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death C but, F Uh, I'm a defense worker. I'm, government tool control specialist. Are you still employed? Oh. Exempt or? F Oh, yes. F Oh, C so, you didn't even get the severance package. D So, are you happy with what you are doing now? Yeah. Good, good. D Well, it hasn't been a long time T I C or I, I'm significantly shaken by the situation, but not devastated. To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried. C And, C and I seem rather happy about it most of the time, just, just to know, what's, possibilities are, D you know, what might happen. C But still in all, it feels funny. C So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains, I can't seem to get into it right now. F Uh, situational. I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months. I, <breathing> all things being equal, yes. C But, C or, C or even somewhere better, C but, God this is much better than west Texas. C But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas. I, my little brother lives in Austin right now. Goes to U T. I <breathing>, D see that's the problem. For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do, and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches. C And now I feel lost. F Oh, I had job offers. C But, <breathing> I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave. C And that, F Oh D so, had you been with T I long when you changed? F Huh. D Well, there's a noticeable difference there. I've been with them sixteen. Actually, seventeen now, C and, F oh, yeah, momentum is, F uh, driving force in our lives. C But <breathing>, C so, yeah, I'm looking as, as a opportunity. C And, C and I'm looking at it as a change. C And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure. C And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then. F Ha, how about we end this? Nice talking to you. Bye. Yes. D Well, let's see, what kind of hobbies do I have? I guess, F uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing. I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports. C And, F uh, Excuse me. No, not, not really, F um, no, I'm really not too creative D well, I, F uh, D you know, around with my hands and things like that I leave that more up to my Mom <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, <laughter> D well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long. Uhhuh. Wh, what kind of time frame is it, F uh, looking for the, F uh, different shifts up there? Is it, F uh, basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas, F Oh, wow. Uhhuh. Wow, how about that. Yeah, that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney. How about that. D Well, that's, F uh, that's unfortunate is there many other, are you in the defense? Is it, F uh, many other corporations in the area? <Laughter> D Well, I'm sure with the new, F uh, aw, contract awarding I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it? That, F uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that. F Oh, really? Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs? How about that. Uhhuh. D Well, you in the, F uh, computer operations or in the actual, F uh, manufacturing? Right, yeah, that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also. Am I still employed by T I, no, I took a leave of, of T I back in November. Actually, December was my first month away from them. Exempt. It, F uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, F uh, it was purely by my own choice. It wasn't, F uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave, C but it was just an opportunity arose C and decided to take it. No. I should have taken the, the, the, D you know, F uh, option when that was there, C but it was just, I missed it by a couple months. C But, D you know, what can one do. I'm just happy still to have a job. Yeah, I am kind of happy with it, it's getting better all the time, I knew it would be different from the very beginning, C but, D you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system, D so I was in the computer operations it's, F uh, D you know, it all starts to become similar there's, D you know, there's benefits C and there's things that weren't as good, C but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing C and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de, the defense area but manufacturing in general. Uhhuh. That's great. That's good. Uhhuh. Sure, yeah. Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table. It may be a blessing in disguise. I know a number of people who are, F uh, surplused C and they're just, actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside. Exactly. Uhhuh, D well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsyturvy right now as soon as you dec, decide on a pass, Uhhuh. D Well, would you like to be there? Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh <laughter>. D Well, just take the day, <Laughter> D Well, actually, F uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, D you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice. F Oh, that's a beautiful place. Uhhuh. That's just fantastic down there. Take it more as a, this is your opportunity to do whatever you want, pick out where you want to live, C and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's a, it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, the best thing about it is that you can, F uh, try something if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else. That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here, I'll take a chance, if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different. Five years. Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine, D you know, the longer and longer it goes, Uhhuh. D Well, that's good, you've got a good attitude about it. Uhhuh. Right, there you go. That's the way to do it. There you go, that's the thing to do. That's much funner than doing any kind of job. That will work out just fine. All right, nice talking to you. Goodbye.
