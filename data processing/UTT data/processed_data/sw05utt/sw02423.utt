D So, do you have any hobbies? Yeah, F uh, I'm an avid gardener, F oh, F Um, I consider that a hobby. I don't know, they were D like suggesting, D like handcraft things which, I guess that's a really true, true hobby, C but I, I think anything that you enjoy, F um, it doesn't really have to matter, E I mean, it could be working on cars could be your hobby really. . Yeah, D well, I don't know, I told my husband, I said, you go out some to work on the car, it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong. I says, you go pay to have someone do it. C Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something. F Oh, yeah. F Um, D well, right now we, F um, start our seeds inside. We'll start them inside C and, F uh, Yeah, D well, we usually start them right in the house. My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck C and, C and the wi, C and a wind storm come and knock it down. C But she's had really good luck. E I mean, i, ca, next month, D well, actually, it, if you, if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside, pretty much the end of May, you can leave them outside. You might put them in the ground just the first week of June C but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May. Oh. Yeah, D well, D well, we live, we live really close to Lake Champlain, which is in the Champlain Valley, C so we're a little, we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts C so, Yeah. We are a little lucky. D Well, my brother lives ten miles from here C and he gets frost C and, his crop gets killed. Yeah, from Plattsburgh Air Force Base. <Laughter> C But, F um, Yeah, Plattsburgh's kind of a, it's, F uh, it's, F uh, depressed economically. When you go across the lake, F um, I don't know why we have so much going for us, I really don't. I'm, just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital C and they've never had, D well, they've had layoffs recently, C but when we got hired here, no, no, never any layoffs, never, never, C and now we're looking at serious, I, E I mean, I'm a technician. When they start getting rid of technicians, D Well, I interviewed with them. C But I didn't want to go to Texas. Even though my, F um, mother's people are from Georgia. Yeah. D Well, I guess we have to get back to hobbies since, Stick on the subject. D Well, interesting thing that I do is with, gardening, F uh, my sister grows flowers that you can dry, C and you can make fl, F uh, dried flower arrangements C and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun. C And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with, F uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, F uh, eucalyptus. D Yo, you know what eucalyptus is? It's, Yeah, it's got a s, Yeah, at first I'm D like, F oh, how, why do people like this, C but it, it is kind of a nice smell after a while. People put them in, <Laughter>. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, F uh, like a fad thing. I, I don't know. It's, I've never heard of it, in the last five years I've used so much of it that, I hate, Yeah, it is. Yeah, it, it looks really po, potent stuff. C But, F uh, it's, D yeah, I think it's the greatest stuff in the world, though. It's, jeez, they, I make all kinds of things with it. We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers. I, I almost want to start a business doing it, C but I don't, I, I'm so, F uh, timid when it comes to starting a business. Yeah, it is, especially with the, being in on the creative a, aspect and the crafty end. D You know, after a while you make some stuff, then you start looking at it, go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly <laughter>. C But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby. F Um, he does it, believe it or not, A I wouldn't imagine why, but to get out of the house, away from his wife, C because he's a seasonal worker, he works in the construction. C And up here it's almost a pattern, C and you see your fathers do it, then their sons do it. What they do is they work construction, then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter. C And, F uh, this guy was going nuts, C and his, F uh, son built him a garage and got him some, F uh, F oh, I don't know what the equipment's called, but planers and things and s, set him up, C and h, he makes, all kinds of furniture for, F um, his kids, C and he makes, F uh, F uh, D like little kids' furniture. He gets right into it C and, F uh, Yeah, it's a, it's a really, good thing because it's keeping him sane, C and C plus it's keeping his marriage <laughter>, D so, C and, C and C plus he's getting on in his years now. He's, he's not that old, C but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost, to, to do something like that. C And, F uh, it's really, it's, it's, F uh, hard work. I couldn't imagine taking lumber, raw lumber and trying to make something out of it. He d, He dowels everything. C And it's all got to line up. It's, <laughter> C and, F uh, I don't think he goofs too much, I don't to, see too much scrap around. God, I'm envious <laughter>. Is it going to be, Is it going to be really dry? F Uh, are you pl, are you, now I always plant trees in the fall. I don't know why D so the, the cold weather can kill them C but I guess, F Oh, that's good. I guess they, they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all. Yeah. Yeah, C and, F uh, when you have time to do it <laughter>. My sister does, F uh, flower gardens. She gets right into it. She spends lots of money on them. C And I guess a lot of people do, do do that. They landscape their whole house with flower gardens. She's got D like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba, tree bark all over her lawn <laughter>. It gets, ya, Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house C or is it, D So you don't have a lot of tree coverage? C Because goi, going to make, Yeah. D See, F um, F uh, where A my, F uh, D well, my grandmother passed away, but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees, C and they just shade everything. F Uh, it's in Georgia. It's, D yeah, it's right outside of Macon, C and, C and it's just a, I like the way that, I like the way that idea of the south is, C but when I think of Texas, I think of nothing but, no trees and just grass <laughter>. Yeah. D So it's that dry heat? D Well, where is it, is it Hous, wasn't it Houston's humid? Yeah. It's humid. D Well, right at the present time nothing real special. I kind of like gardening C and I'm kind of into camping and, D you know, vacationing, that sort of thing. I don't have any real serious, F Oh, okay. I think you're, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Really yeah, I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit, too. No, I, I guess if you make money at it, it becomes a vocation <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening, you've still got a couple months to go, haven't you? Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, that's right, you would, yeah. In cold frames or whatever the, Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I've, I've lived in, in Texas and New Mexico most of my life, C but I did once, I spent one winter in North Dakota, C and I, I remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up, C and, F uh <breathing>, F Oh, yeah. Okay, C because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit? Yeah. You're at, Yeah. You're right across the, F uh, lake from, what, Plattsburgh? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I had, I had a cousin that was stationed there, Plattsburgh for a while. He, he remembers lots of snow <laughter>. F Oh, really, F oh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, D well, I'm, I'm working for T I, Texas Instruments, down here. F Oh, yeah? F Oh, <laughter>. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're getting to where, we're straying, I guess, yeah. Uhhuh. F Huh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the, they s, F uh, it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries. It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it C but, Yeah, I didn't realize what it was for a while. I'd walk into a room where some of that, C and I'd wonder what is that, D you know, C and then one day I, I realized that it was eucalyptus. Yeah. Is that the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something? Maybe that's why they're <laughter> so slow. I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something. Yeah <laughter>, yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, that's, that's a big step, yeah. Yeah, F uh, <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, shapers and planers and routers. There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little, little companies of one and two guys, D you know, up there, espec, this particular one, I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire, where out in the, just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in, they may be the same kind of people you're talking about. D You know, they've, they've got twelve weeks to do something, C and they, they're making furniture and just, D you know, things like that during the winter C and then they go off and do other things during the summer. D So, yeah, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. That would be really t, D you know, D like D say the, F Oh, man, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's something. Now our temperatures down here, we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties C and, F uh, C so, C and, F uh, C so as far as, D you know, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight I just got through, I was planting some, some trees out back tonight, C and, F uh, this is, F uh, it's really nice, <Laughter> out tonight. Almost hated to come, D you know. Yeah, these were, F uh, trees that, that wintered. I do, don't know where they came from. They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that. C And they come down here C and they'll sit in the nurseries here C and they'll go ahead and, and, F uh, leaf out. C So what I'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's, E or trees that are already leafed out. Yeah. Mostly, I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall, let them winter D you know, through the fall, C but, F uh, down here, D well, it's done both ways. It, it just kind of depends on what you're, what you're planting, C but, F uh all the shrubs and, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Flowers, during the summer down here, the, the normal kind of flowers, there's very few of them that will really do well. Everything does real well here in the spring until about, F oh, first part of June C and then the re, the heat sets in. C And June, July, August are, D you know, most of the, those kind of plants just, are just barely staying alive, let alone make flowers. F Uh, we're in a relatively new area. We're kind of out of, F uh, the natural tree area. We're kind of up on a, on a higher, on a slope. C So we don't have, where we are right now there are very few trees. This was, this was, this was pasture land, C but down the, down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are, look like jungles, D you know. They're really, Uhhuh. Now where is this? In Georgia, yeah, yeah. D Well, I tell you what, D now, D see, East Texas, there's two parts of Texas, East Texas and North Texas. Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way, weather and everything. The two cities are very, very identical, C so if you were familiar with Atlanta, F uh, F Uh, D well, no, it's, it's, F uh, not dry at all. It, it's humid. Hu, Houston is awful <laughter>. Houston is really humid. No,
