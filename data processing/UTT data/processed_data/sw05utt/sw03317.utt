Okay, what kind of house do you live in? Uhhuh. D Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar. I live in one, I don't have a swimming pool. C And mine's about twentyseven hundred square foot. C But the four bedrooms C and all the rest of it sounds just about <laughter>, about alike. I think it's pretty much typical for this area. I've been in the house I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I bet you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds interesting. I bet he's enjoyed having it that way C because some, kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications. Uhhuh. D Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage. They're kind of rare. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, C but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, D you know, workbench and everything. D Now, mine does not work on cars, he just piddles on this and that. C But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things. <Laughter>. It really is. C Because, D you know, they have a lot of things of their own, C and I, D you know, I wouldn't mind having, C and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff, <lipsmack> C but I, someone, I don't know, it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out <laughter> or something. C So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I still, all three of my daughters are married, but, I don't know, I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. C And some of them coming back home and things, D you know. C And we've got grandchildren now, C so when they come, they have to have a place. That's right, you sure don't. At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I don't blame you for that. D Well, I have the three girls C and then we ended up with four grandsons. C And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls. C And, F uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses <laughter>. It feels, after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house, they know everything. C But, they're fun. D Well, I just watch them. I d, I never did put things up when my kids were little C and I haven't with them. I try to teach them not to get into things. <Laughter> I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. C So it's worked pretty well. There's, I don't really think anything's been broken. Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this <laughter>, D you know. C But, all in all, they mind pretty well. C But, I guess most of the hou, d, what kind of roof does your house have? Here I'm getting off the subject. D Well, F uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas C and it's, F uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back C and, It's about thirtyfive hundred square feet. Yeah. It is. Have you been living there very long? C So you've been there longer. We built this one about, F uh, it's been <breathing>, let's see <sniffing>, it's been six years six and a half years ago, C and we subcontracted it out ourselves. We bought the lot and, F uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications C and then we subbed it out, C so, we've been here a little over six years now. And F uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in. My husband got his big garage. He ha, we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in C and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines C and, so he has all the work space he needs. He, It is, C and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, F uh, built C and the garages were always, if the house w, was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have. Uhhuh. C So we put a three car garage in. C But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. All of it was taken up with just car space. C And so he has a big <noise> landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on. D Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. D Well, that's nice that it's not in your house. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home. C And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family <noise> come. His parents come C and also the kids have friends who come and stay C and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom. Right. F Oh, I understand <<faint>>. D Well, we, <Laughter> That's true C and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room. D Well, I c, I haven't reached that point yet. I've heard people say that. C But, F uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while. He's out of college and has a good job, C so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet, C and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while, C but she's still in college C and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first. That's what she plans to do. D So, I hope so. F Oh, hoho. A whole new world. Uhhuh. I can understand. Uhhuh. C So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute. Yeah. D Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with <laughter> grandchildren. F Um, uhhuh <<faint>>. D Well, we have,
