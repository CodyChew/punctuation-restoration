D Well, what kind of vacations do you like to take?. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Where have you gone there? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah D well, I've been over there too. I even. Let's see, F um, mostly Germany and France. I lived in France for a year and a half C so I was able, C but, I, once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany C because, F uh, I've got relatives there C and I just like it there. C So, C but, F um, Austria, I found really pretty and Switzerland, yeah, C and I, I lived in the Alps in France C so I anything in the mountains over there I just love. Then I finally made it to England, too, F uh, on my way home, F um, I lived in Africa, actually, C and on my way home from there. Yeah. Yeah. C So, F um, C and you always have to go out, fly through, E or unless you fly from Nairobi, you have to fly through, F um, F uh, Europe on your way home. C So, I went to England, C and I really liked it there too. I know, it's true. That's the one thing. Yeah. Yeah, D actually now you can get some really good deals flying over, C but it's once you're there you still have to spend money <laughter>. Unless you know people, D you know <laughter>. Uhhuh. That helps a lot. C But. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I haven't. I've been, I've, most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast C or this summer I went to Colorado C and, F uh, I'd love to go to the East Coast, during the Fall. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. I haven't been there, anywhere on the East Coast. I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C So the type of vacation you'd like, F um, D like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week? Yeah, main, mainly probably because you want to see everything. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah. D Well, I liked it. I was working in Cameroon, Africa C and it's not a, <inhaling> it's not a place for tourists, E I mean, they're not used to having tourists there, C so it's, you're kind of roughing it. C But, F um, I liked it, I liked it. The people there are just very, very friendly C and. F Um, I was working with an organization that does Bible translation. C So I was doing linguistic work actually, travelling around, finding out about languages, and F uh, what they call survey work. Find out where the languages are. C So, I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people. F Um. Yeah, I enjoyed it. C So. Yeah. Yeah, my cousin came over while I was there, C and she came to Cameroon C and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around D you know, close to Nairobi in Kenya. C So, she'd always dreamed of doing that too. C So. Yeah. C So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to <laughter>? It sounds like we've been to some of the same places. D Well, we've, F uh, we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe C so <laughter>. C So, I, I guess those are the types I like <laughter>. We've really enjoyed them. We've gone to, F um, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and England. We've been to Germany twice. C But, F um, I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland. Uhhuh. Where have you been? Uhhuh. F Oh, how neat. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's neat. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, how neat. F Oh, yeah. You lived in Africa? F Oh, my goodness <laughter>. Wow. Uhhuh. It's so expensive over there <laughter>. <Laughter>. It really is. It just, it's, it's, I love to go over there, C but it's so darn expensive to go over. Yeah. F Oh, I know, just. Right. Then you can stay with them, C and yeah. Yeah. D You know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone. D You know, I'd like to go to Hawaii some time, C and C and, F uh, we made it, we've, we've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. C So. Feel like we've accomplished a little bit here. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. The, F oh, the it's, F oh, I've always wanted to go there. I've seen pictures, C and, C and it looks gorgeous. We, F um, we made a trip up the East Coast. It was, F uh, in the summer C and it really is pretty. It's, F uh, both coasts are really pretty C but, F um, I love the Carolinas. It's just gorgeous over there. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and, and go over there. Yeah, C but there's, D you know, there's a lot to see here C but I just love going over to Europe because it's so, their way of life is just so different than ours. D You know, we're so fast paced here, C and over there, D you know, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check D you know <laughter> they're so leisurely over there C and it's kind of nice to, to have that. D Well, usually a bunch of different places. Right, see as much as you can while you're there. Yeah. How did you like Africa? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What type of work? F Oh, okay. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's neat. I've, I've always, F um, I've talked to people who have been to Africa, C and they, C and then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out <laughter>. F Um, C but I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there. Uhhuh. F Oh how neat. Yeah, that's great. F Uh. Yeah, it does.
