You bet. They tell you our topic? You've got it. Yes, we do. F Uh, my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old, C and we have a, a cat, which is, F uh, I guess about five years old. How about you guys? Three dogs. C And two bi, what kind of birds do you have? No, kidding. En, enjoy them? You let them out and let them fly around and everything? Okay. You, D You know, this is like a cruelty joke, C and I apologize if you're a bird lover, C but, F uh, we had a parakeet. And, my fault, put up our first electric fan. And never thought about it. Knocked that parakeet <laughter> right out of the air. It killed him? F Oh, that's, D well, it killed ours, I'll be darned. <Laughter>. D Well, speaking of pets, I'll tell you, my, my kids are older now, my, both of them are either in or out of college, C but, C but we had for years, about five years I guess, had a, my son had a Burmese boa constrictor, C and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in, in length, C and finally my wife, wife, bless her heart, got rid of it, because I didn't really like it. We also had a, <laughter> one year down in Florida on a vacation, for Father's Day, my kids, years ago, maybe, F uh, ten years ago, go, bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop. It'd be D like, it'd been D like deactivated as far as s, s, smell and everything, C and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years, C and, C and my son left, went to school, we finally sold his boa constrictor, C but my son needed some money, C and we, we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars. C So, when the guy came over, he was infatuated by that skunk, C so I made him a deal, I said, You take that skunk, C and, he said, I'll sell that snake to you for two fifty. I said, otherwise I'm going to give it to this other man. C So he took the skunk, too. C And the skunk was a good, a decent pet, C but, D you know, does his little jobbies in the litter box, C and is, is. C And it was sort of a neat, C but, they just stink too much <laughter>. That was sort of fun, D you know, I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover. I use to visualize my wife, many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa, C and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body and with his, with his head right on her neck C and the skunk would be sitting at her feet, C but the cat would be on the back of the sofa, C and a dog would be running around crazy <laughter>. F Oh, gosh. F Oh, my son bought this snake, F uh, someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school, C and it was just a small thing then, C but it got to be pretty big, C and, D you know, you'd feed it, you'd feed it, you put, feed him small mice to big rats and things like that it's just, F uh, too much. That snake used to watch our cat walk around. I always told my wife, I says D you know, your friend's going to get our cat one of these days <laughter>. F Oh, me neither. We're down to a simple dog and cat now, C and that's the way it should be, C and. Haven't had any parakeets for quite a while, birds. F Uh, customer of mine has a parrot, C and, F uh, gosh, sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot, C and that was just mind boggling. Are you? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yes. F Oh, gosh. <Laughter> That's neat. Why, sure. <Laughter>. Come to my menagerie. F Uh, pets. Do you have pets? F Oh, my goodness. We have three dogs and two birds at this point. Parakeets. F Oh, have a ball with them. D Well, no, because my dogs <laughter> chase them. C So in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, we had that happen once, F um, my son had the bird back in his room, C because it's his bir, D well, the first one that we had was his bird, C and I had a ceiling fan put up, C and it, the bird got away from him one afternoon, C and E I mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall, I thought, F oh so much for the bird. No, he's still alive and kicking. No, I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot, C but it threw him up against the wall, D you know, C and he slid <laughter> down the wall. F Oh, gosh. F Oh, I hate them. F Oh, my goodness. You're kidding. <Laughter>. F Oh D well, that's pretty good. F Oh, yeah, F oh, yeah. F Oh, you're kidding. Oh. F Oh, my gosh. I can not ima, I just, I don't, in fact my brother has a, F uh, a exotic pet shop out in California, C and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail, D you know, I'm going don't do that, because they won't come in my house. Uhhuh. F Oh, my gosh. <Laughter> F Oh, my gosh. That is wild. F Oh, I just can't do those, and the lizards and the all those those things, <ugh> they, they need to stay outside, far away from me. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, they are so expensive. D Well, my son was just dying for a bird, C and I'm really allergic to them, C so I try to stay away from them, except I've gotten real attached to this one, C and, C and, F uh, we went down to Canton one time F oh, gosh, two or three years ago now, C and he'd saved up his allowance, D you know, and picked him out a bird in a bird cage C and, C and that stinking bird, when I brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you clamped onto my finger and would not, E I mean, I had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage, C and he has tried to bite me for two years, C and all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends. He gives me kisses, he talks now C and it's just hysterical. I'm the only one that pays attention to him. C And I'm a substitute teacher C and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said, <<sounds highpitched like a child's voice>> my mom's making me get rid of the bird, we have too many pets. I thought, yeah, right come tell me about it, D you know. They knew the sucker when they saw one. C So now we have two parakeets.
