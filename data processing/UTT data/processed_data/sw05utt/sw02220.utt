I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music C and they're, none of them are recent, right. D So I like Gordon Lightfoot, do you know who he is? <Laughter> C And the Moody Blues, C and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot, C and Willie Nelson. Yeah. C But not all country. I don't like that, when they start, I don't know. I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character. Yeah. <Laughter> My truck is broken down. Yeah. There, there's a guy, have you ever heard of George Winston, he plays piano. I think he's dead now, <laughter> C but he plays wonderfully. I like that. Very badly. I've got a piano, my mother got a piano C and, F uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, C so we all had to take lessons, C and I was the one that did the least poorly, C so she gave it to me. C And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, C but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. It is real relaxing. Yeah. F Oh, so do I. Forgot about that. I said so do I, I forgot about jazz <laughter>. Yes, we've got about five of those. I love them. Uhhuh. I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store C and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it C and I just, I heard a piece C and it was just so wonderful. C And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it. Yeah. E I mean you can just sit, you know those little booklets that come along with it C and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music. My, my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, then he buys the pieces that have that person. D You know, on it. F Huh? E I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, C but he does. Yeah. Were you in the band? So was I. Yeah. Yeah. I like the Moody Blues. Did you like them? D So what type, Simply Red, I've never heard of that. Is it just instrumental? Yeah. Yeah. D Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road <laughter>. We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. C And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs. Yeah, where are you? Okay. D So we're in Garland. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else <laughter>. For colleges? D Well, they're not c, They're not going to recruit me anymore, I'm through. <Laughter> No more for me. What, what do you do? Are you going to go to East Texas for that? That'd probably be pretty interesting. I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. They had summonsed eight hundred people, about four hundred showed up, C and it was for a murder trial. This guy had supposedly, F uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose <laughter>. Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eightythree. C And they had us fill out a long questionnaire. We stayed till about one thirty C and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time C and the trial won't take place until June. C And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. C And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. I was an investigator C and I was tailing the woman that was killed. D Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer C and he said that this woman <talking> this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband C and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. C And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, F uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, C and he had skipped bail C and they finally extradited him C and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced. Yeah. The, the investigator. Yeah, he, he got off right away. C And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that, C so I figure that that will make me biased C and I won't be chosen. Hopefully <laughter>. Yeah. The death penalty. No. I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody. D You know. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But then when you're, when you're picked, D see I was picked for another murder trial before F oh, gosh C and it's so hard because, D you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, C and if you're trying to hold out, D you know, there's so much pressure on you C and you've got to come up with a decision. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. D So you like a, a variety. Sort of easy listening because you like country C but then, F Um. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah, I, I like some of his songs, though. They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. They're just kind of sweet sometimes. D You know, E I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, D you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, D you know <laughter>. Yeah, my truck's broken down C and my house just burned down, D you know. C But, No. Uhhuh. Are, d, are you, do you play the piano, is, C or you just like it? <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, it must be fun to be able to play it C and, D you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think. <Laughter> C because E I mean, I play the flute C and not many things you can play that'll, D you know, people will sit there and sing along to C and you can't sing along either C so, C but, F uh, I like a lot, F uh, I like classical music just because of the, when, I, I don't play, I like jazz music C but <throat_clearing>, What's that? What's that? Yeah, I like a lot, D like, I like, F uh, is it the New Age music, D like with, F uh, F uh, the, I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection. Yeah, I love those, too. They're just so relaxing. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that nice. E I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, D you know, C and, F uh, it, it, it, it, D you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, C but, it, it's mostly relaxing C and you don't, because it doesn't have words, D you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, D you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean C or, C but, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. I, I can't identify them either. I just like them. I could, I know which ones come next, C but I don't even know their names. Most of them I don't know their names of the song, C but I, I can identify them. C But I like that C and I like, F uh, course I, I like classical music. C And, F uh, I was in the band, yeah C and I was in, D like, chamber music groups and stuff, C so I'm used to pieces C and, C and I played classical flute, I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, C so. I c, I can relate to it, I suppose <laughter>. C But, F uh, C and I like, I'm like you <throat_clearing> I like the older stuff, too, C because I like Chicago C and I like <laughter>, I like, F uh, <lipsmack>, F uh, let me think who, F uh, I like, F uh, Hebert, F uh, F oh, you don't know Hebert Laws, C but Hebert Laws a flute player, he's a jazz flute player C and I like, F uh, F uh, Chuck Mangione, do you know who Chuck Mangione is? Yeah, I like Chuck Mangione <laughter>. Trying to think of all, F uh, F oh, what's his name, plays the trumpet. F Uh, Yeah. Yeah, I like Moody Blues. I, I like mostly the older groups I think. F Oh, c, C but we do have, I like Simply Red, we got Simply Red. I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like <laughter>. C And, F uh, I like Breeze, I like the group. I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound l, a lot like r, F uh, Simply Red. If I'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays, that's it's easy listening. F Uh. No, it's, it's got people singing, C but <throat_clearing> it's it is instrumental. C But it's, it's got people singing C but it's got a, D like a whole bunch of people singing. You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart <<speaking to someone else in the room>> <<pause>>, he can't hear me. I, I don't remember how many people, C but, it's, it's got men and women C and it's not, it's, it's nice, I mean it's pleasant, D you know, music. It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. C But it's not as, it's not like, F uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. D You know, it doesn't have, D like all the brass and everything. Yeah. <Breathing>. F Oh, you must live in this area. We're in Sherman. F Oh, okay. You're going to Commerce? For East Texas or something? F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. D Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. That's why I was just w, Yeah, East Texas is recruiting for, D you know, their fall semester C and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area. <Laughter>. No more, F huh. D Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, C but I'm going to school, F uh, for legal assistant C and that's what I know, C so, C and, F uh, just nothing basically <laughter>. No, no, it, no I don't go to East Texas. I got a degree from T W U, C but I'm really interested in legal, D you know, in the legal environment, C but I don't want to be a lawyer <laughter> C so I said D well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, that's how it works. C And this is the man that was in front of you? F Oh, well they'll, weed him out. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, not necessarily C but there's probably something else that might make you. C Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, D you know, not be accepted for j, the jury. E I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, D you know, and, and know some of the different things about it C but, F uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. D You know, if you, if you don't believe, D like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. C So C but, Yeah, D so, D see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, D you know, C because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, D you know, not gui, you're, you're not going to want to have him have that cri, F uh, that punishment. C So, Uhhuh. D Well, especially with something where you have to f, you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt C and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,
