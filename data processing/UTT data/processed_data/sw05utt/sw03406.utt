D So what do you, F uh, think is the, F uh, the worst culprit for air pollution? Uhhuh. Yeah. I, F uh, I, it's hard to put the finger on, F uh, what's worse, you know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, F um, with, F uh, your hydrocarbons, F uh causing the damage in which, D Well, I notice on one of these, F uh, home shopping networks they were selling these, F uh, halogen, F uh, fire extinguishers C and the halogen is, F uh, an ozone depleter, C and it got hydrocarbons in there. It's a very clean, F uh, fire extinguisher, C but it's, D you know, really bad on the environment. Yeah. Yeah. I know, F uh, in the Twin Cities area, I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right, C but they had a new policy where in order to get your, F uh, your license, F uh, your car license, F uh, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards C and, F uh. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, yeah I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, C and as far as where I live, I don't have to do that, C but I have an old car which I doubt would, F uh, would, F uh, pass the inspection, a seventysix, C and, F uh, D you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to, to repair it to meet standards. Yeah. C So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution, C but, F uh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, D well, D well around here I, we get, F uh, D well it depends, D you know, C either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way, C and in the summer time <laughter> we probably get yours. Yeah. Yeah, D well, it, F uh, th, that's a big thing, too. I know it has nothing to do with air pollution, C but I kind of look at the way people treat our, Okay. D Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things. F Um, factories that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants, D you know, C and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. F Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, C and I think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit. It's hurting, D you know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe where they, where they have high industry. C So we're not the lone ranger here. Yeah. Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, C but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot. Yeah. Yeah. F Huh. Yeah, I guess I missed that one. F Uh. Automobiles of course are contributing, too, C and, you know, how, how we are with our love affair with the auto kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess. Yeah. We have that here, too, C but it's part of the inspection sticker, D you know, they put a probe in your exhaust pipe C and, C and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out, C and so that's, D you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here. Yeah. Yeah. It'd probably be difficult anyway. I was just reading an article in, F uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine C and, F uh, they've got a new, F uh, D you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot, a lot of people are burning wood, those of us who have, I've got a place in the country, D you know C and, F uh, they've had catalytic con, D you know, catalytic converters on those, on, F uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and Washington, C but they've had up those for quite a while, C and somebody's come up with a new one that, F uh, sort of, it's a, it's a catalytic converter, it's, it's a plate that fits in, D you know, into the smoke pipe C and, F uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself. The more smoke is produced, D you know, after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is. C And it sounds real neat. I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet, C but that, that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on D you know, old, old, F uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them. That might help a little bit, especially in some places. We're really lucky here. We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out. D Now sometimes we get a kind of a, especially in, in, F uh, autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, C but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well. Probably blowing up there to you guys <laughter>. Yeah. It comes back. <Laughter> Yeah. I really think, F uh, D you know, we're doing some, some important things. Education, raising consciousness awareness, F uh, I know school kids, I work for the school district here, C and, F uh, D you know, this is one of the big things with kids. Kids are writing letters to the newspapers about, D you know, telling adults to clean up their act C and, it's F uh, D you know, I hope we're not too late with it. We're, we're, F uh, we're having all kinds of recycling.
