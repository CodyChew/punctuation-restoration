I don't, guess we got our first, F uh, credit card, F oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when, I first got married was a Visa card. F Uh, issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City, C because my sister worked at the, F uh, the Visa some Bank Americard center there. C So, we were still in college C and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified. They've come in handy over the years. F Uh, C and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes. Especially, D you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card. C And, F uh, I find if you're not careful you wind up, F uh, a month or so, staring those bills in the face C and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff C and it adds up. C So, sometimes, F uh, especially traveling with T I, D you know, everything goes on American Express, C and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping. C But, F uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible, F uh, I kind of like having them for, F uh, gasoline purchases. Yeah. C But other than that, F uh, I, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day C and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it. How, how do you look at counting credit cards? D Well, that's, Right. D Well, that's kind of the way we were doing it's, F uh, I guess for that very reason that, that, F uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing, <Throat_clearing> it's just too much by the time you get, D well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month C and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid. Yeah. C And I give them, maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid C because they're, know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent. Sometimes, it's twentytwo percent interest. Yeah. I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, F uh, the, F uh, American Express card with T I, there's no, with the American Express card from T I, there's no, F um, late fee, there's no, F uh, interest rate, you ei, you either pay the thing off C or they come get it. C And it's turned into personnel C and they come get you <throat_clearing>. C So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then, some of the others do. C But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month, C so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to. F Oh, yeah. You can use it like any other card, C and, F uh, C but, it, D you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month, C and who knows how many people, are looking at those, F uh, bills that come in, and those statements, you're not the only one. C So, yo, F uh, you want to make sure that, F uh, is that okay, is that o, okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying, C and most of the time it is. C But, most of the others I've sent back, E I mean, all you get is card offers, I've got three card offers now, F uh, from gas companies and, F uh, Visa Gold and, F uh, some, <noise>, other bank, F uh, Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out. C And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one, I don't want to have to mess with it. D You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards, C and, F uh, one of these days it's going to all be full. F Oh, that's not bad. Yeah. No, if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away. F Um, years ago, D well, th, I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for, F oh, probably fifteen years, C and then they started charging, F uh, annual membership fees, C and I said, adios, I'm, D you know, I'm not paying you, It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell. E I mean, they've been, D Well, sure. C And they, I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards, they're going to get cards at the, twenty bucks a pop. There's going to be that much more. F Uh, C so, then a couple years ago I found, F uh, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership. C So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card, C so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, I, it would be okay, C but I can't see paying someone to use their card. Be charged their eighteen percent interest, C so. Yeah, I think you're right. The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere. <<Very faint>> Yeah. Yeah, it sure does. Maybe they're counting on that, I don't know. D Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for talking. Bye. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <noise>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> Yeah. F Oh, tell me about it <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah, they add up quick <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, D you know. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah. We just, F uh, quit using them <laughter>. C And they got us in trouble, we took a loan and paid them all off. We keep them, F uh, we keep, F uh, one gas card and, F uh, and, F uh, Visa just, D you know, in case there's an emergency or, something C but other than that we don't use them anymore <laughter> <noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> I know, isn't that funny? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, C and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid C and, Uhhuh. F Huh. Huh? Uhhuh. F Oh, really? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Can you use that one for personal use? F Oh, you can? Uhhuh. F Oh, I see, F huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, I do too, I don't even open them much, I throw them out. Uhhuh. A girlfriend of mine found a, it was a Visa or MasterCard, she found an ad for one in D like a GOOD HOU, HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent. shoot I need one of those <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Why do they do that? E I mean, E I mean they get enough, D you know, on the interest <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. No, I can't either. Yeah. Yeah, really. <Laughter> gets a lot of people in, in trouble <laughter>. Okay. Nice talking to you. Byebye.
