What do you think? <noise>. <Noise> Uhhuh. I can be, C but go ahead <laughter>. Right. Right. We fax everything. We don't even wait for the mail anymore. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Right. Right. You're expected to, exactly. C And I recently read an article on just this, that said stress today is so much worse <talking>. It should be less because <noise> we have a microwave C and our grandmothers had to bake brownies C and we can throw them in a microwave for <talking> two minutes C but the more conveniences we have, the more that's expected of us C and we have no down time. D Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to. C So we keep moving. We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen. We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing. C So we have no <talking> relaxation time in between C so they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to, to deal with that and get your, <noise> your time in between things. C So that's good. That's an interesting point. C But I just think our, our family lives have changed <noise> drastically. C And I think that's ju, of course a part of it is technology. E I mean our kids, where would they be without Nintendo and, D you know, their T V shows C and no, some of that is really bad I think. C But, we have all single families. So many single families now. F Uh, a lot of working, both parents are working. C So there's a whole big effect on our kids C and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father. D You know, I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years. <Talking>. You're probably right <talking>. C And I'm an O B nurse C and that's never really occurred to me but that's, that's interesting. I never really thought about it that way. Yeah, yeah. That's true. When is this good or not good. We don't know that yet <laughter>. Yeah. I don't know either. <Noise>. That's true. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of scary. F Huh. D Well that's true. C But, I, it's just very, very different C and I guess every ten years it's just been very different. D So. C And I don't know what's going to happen. F Uh, I know what I'm seeing here at m, my job <talking> is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers C and they've got their homes C and they've got, D Well, F uh, I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago, F uh, <swallowing> because I'm not that old yet. F Um <laughter>. <Laughter> F Uh, I know that, F uh, E I mean obviously you look at, at technologic, the technological aspect of, of social change. E I mean you didn't have, F uh, you didn't have video games. You didn't have home computers. You didn't have Xerox machines. E I mean, F uh, you, you try to, you go into a, a business today C and, you, you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper C and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and, and everything have become such, D you know, su, such a, a par, a part of the way we live. C And, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh, a business associate of mine was, was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail C and you had to do something, this was concerning the S E C, C and so if they had business to do, they had to finish it, D you know, three days in advance so they could get it through the mail. C And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute. Because you can get it there, D you know in, in a matter of minutes D you know, through a fax machine C and because of that, these quote, unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder. C Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, there's that C and there's the fact that, D you know, nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen. E I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we, have continuation, large scale immigration into the country. Yeah, yeah. I saw that, the numbers on that awhile back C and I was D like, uhhuh <laughter> C so <<very faint>>. D Well, F uh, In terms of the long term effect, effect on, on America, in terms of the culture and everything, I don't know. F Uh, Most of the, of the next generation is going to be in, E or, E or an, ex, ex, extremely large par, part of the next generation is going to be, D you know, second generation, f, F uh, from immigrant parents. C And they're going to be really struggling C and I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good <laughter>. E I mean, it's no longer the, the, F uh, the accomplishment that it, that it once was C and not that many people are really trying I don't think <swallowing>. Yeah <<very faint>>. Yeah, tha,
