Go ahead <laughter>. F Uh, no I haven't. C But, in my job, A I'm a nurse, and we are allowed to be. E I mean, D you know, this is the rules that they can do this anytime. F Uh, I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. They can if they choose to. Right. Have you, D well F wai, have you had any experience with it at all? Uhhuh. C So what do you think about that? Right, right. D See I know of that too. C And I also know that things like antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off. C And you cannot get a job because of it C and they may not tell you the reason why. Uhhuh. D See, C and so it really is a dangerous thing that way C because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job C and they weren't told why. C But a lot of people say the reason why, after you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you. Or this person never use any drugs. F Uh, you should. C Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something. I have real mixed feelings about it. I don't know. The accuracy? I don't know. I don't know. C But, I know there are a lot of things that can influence them C and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time. C And if you could show that, I, I interviewed for a job recently C and I was taking Entex. C And my doctor gave me a prescription for it. C And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, D you know. C And it didn't come up that I needed to do it C but this could happen to anybody C and if they would just say F oh, this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them D you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. C So I don't know. Yeah, I'm not sure either. The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it C because they say they can spot check. Yeah. D Well, it sort of is. C And this is it, this, I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways. D You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. D You know, C so as a patient, I feel D well, D yeah, we probably should be protected. C But, on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too. C So <laughter> D you know, I guess you sort of, you have to have trust some place along the way. You can't go around testing everybody for everything. C So, I don't know. C And I, I think it could be used to hassle somebody. If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this. D You know, they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess. I can see where it could become a problem. Really. F Oh, wow! C But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. That's the other thing. E I mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, D you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on C and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah, yeah. C So that probably wouldn't be too good either. F Uh, have you every been tested for a new job or anything? C So it's just sort of, F uh, they can if they, F Oh, okay. F Uh, not really C but I've always worked on a university level C but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. F Uh, I don't, I don't think they're very accurate C because, E I mean, I know their lifestyles changed p, prior to the drug test C and I know they changed afterwards. Yeah, I, I had a friend, it didn't cause her any problems with her job C but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. C But what it was, was she had been u, she had been, F uh, in the jungle C and it was some Malaria medication C and she tested positive for that. D See, I always, I thought they got, you got called back if you tested positive, for more tests. How, do you know how wrong they are? Are they, E I mean, is there a margin of error? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. C And I, I'm not so sure they are that needed. E I mean, Ye, if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem. C But the occasional person, then it's almost D like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah <sniffing>. C And it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests <<mispronounced>> I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago. C So, I know. Yeah. There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult C but you can't say it was wrong at the time.
