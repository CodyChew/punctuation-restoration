Surprised they get anybody this time of day C but, I've been trying all different times, C but I don't get anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night C so thought, I'll try, Oh <laughter>. Oh. D Well, I go to school C so I'm home certain days, C and, F uh, I really haven't been making any s, phone calls, have you? Got, Oh <laughter>. Have you, have you received many? Yeah. It's, it's, F uh, D well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day. I never had to make one. They just always came <laughter>. People must be tired of it or something. D W, well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, F uh, subject, what do you think? <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Oh. D Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that. I think it might be good for them. C But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent. I'm just concerned about their safety mor, C because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto <laughter>. C And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, D you know. That, that would be my main objection. F Uh, I don't think, it will probably never happen C but, Yeah, D well it, it probably won't. I don't, I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway. We can't, F uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now <laughter>. That's another consideration <laughter>. C But, F uh, I don't know som, some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener, D you know <laughter>. E I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here C and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes C and then they think, they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, D you know <laughter>. I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl <laughter>. Oh <laughter>. D Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it? E I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country. I know. Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, and helping some countries I never even heard of. It seems to me we are, it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders. C But, what do I know, right? <Laughter>. I'm just sitting at home and, and, F uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up, nobody has called me from Washington <laughter>. F Oh, C but, F uh, anyway, how did you get on this program? F Oh, you do work at T I? F Oh, you're in Lewisville. F Oh, yeah. I just went by that place. We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost C and, F uh <laughter>, we went by. That's the first time I'd seen it. It looked really nice. A lot of trees there. It looked like a pretty little, a sight. Sure. F Oh, sure. Di, D Well, my husband works at T I over on Central. F Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure C but, he works over there C and tha, we did it last time. C And, F uh, C so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time. I don't know, they didn't even ask him back <laughter>. That was weird, wasn't it? C But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. C And I can never find anybody. C So, F um, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I've had the same experiences, all right around here. Yeah, I don't know, F uh, I wonder if they really, I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. There's just, there's so many with this one town D you know. E, even in some families some people talk a little bit different. My husband is from New Jersey C and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me C and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, C and that's one family, right? <Laughter>. Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny C but <laughter>, D You know, how that goes <laughter>. F Oh, God. D Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. Sometimes she says at night. Or, or switc, or overloads C so please end your conversation. Right. D Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? <Laughter>. You don't have any kids you want to send over here? <Laughter>. D Well, is <laughter>. D Well, F uh, I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. D Well, one of them is real idealistic, she might <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, I'm at, work C and I just happened to walk back into my office. I've been gone for a little while <laughter>. Uhhuh. I don't, I haven't ever made any. I just receive them <laughter>. I haven't here lately. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. <Laughter>. D Well, I never gave it any thought myself <laughter>. I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. Uhhuh. Exactly. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. I don't know I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, I, I think it would be good for, F uh, everyone to do something like that C but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly <laughter>. <Laughter> Really <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while <laughter>. Wouldn't it though? Uhhuh, it is. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I know it. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. I work at T I. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Hang on a minute. <<Talks to someone in the background>>. No, I don't think so, Yeah, Patty might. I'm back. C But how did you get on it? Oh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Really? F Huh. Uhhuh. I don't get too many. F Huh. The first time I used to get calls from far away too. Like Maryland, and New Jersey, C and C but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. <Laughter> F Oh, I agree. <Laughter> F Oh, shoot. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. No, I sure don't <laughter>. <Laughter> No, no kids <laughter>. <Laughter> F Oh, shoot. <Laughter> My sister is, I'd be more suited to that than her she's just bugs,
