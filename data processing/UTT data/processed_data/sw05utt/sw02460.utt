All right, D well I have a lot of different teams that I like to, to keep in touch with, of course, Texas Rangers being one of them, E I mean, F uh, D you know, you can't live in Dallas without, D you know, D Well, F uh, I originally came from Saint Louis, C so, F uh, the Saint Louis Cardinals are one, F uh, I moved to Kansas City, D see I have, I have a tendency to, a, adopt teams when I wen, go to a tea, F uh, go to a town. Yeah, C so, F uh, I lived in Kansas City for a couple years C and I adopted the Royals, I lived in Houston for two and a half years C so I adopted the, F uh, F uh, the Houston Astros, C so E I mean, D you know, I've got quite a few. No, I don't, I don't get into that too much, eve, every once in a while, I will keep in, in touch, with maybe, D like who's in the top five of hitting, or something like that C but I don't get into, D you know, how many errors somebody has or things like that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I've heard of that one. D Well I didn't know that, that's supposed to be a real good statistic, F uh. D Well that's true, they don't have the offense to, F uh, to get out, or to have the, the more runs, C so. Uhhuh. F Huh. Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway, to tell you the truth. I kind of think it was necessary, E I mean, I, i, i, I don't, I'm not a, a big, F um, pure power hitter anyway. E I mean, I don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time. E I mean, F uh, I think that, F uh, that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it, C but when you get two strikes on you, you have a tend, D you know, you should, D you know, shorten your swing a little bit, D you know, if it's a perfect shot, go for it, C but E I mean, D you know, the strike outs were a big problem for him, C and, F uh, C plus supposedly what I heard, he was not much of a team player anyway, C so. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well that's true. Right. Yeah, D well there's, there's another point to that too. They said the, that F um, that he was horrible at, F uh, at batting with, with men on base. D Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you, D you know, gives you run, obviously. C But E I mean if you can't do it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong, F um, D you know, you, you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs, D you know, to, to be able to, F uh, score enough runs to be able to win in these, F uh, in this day and age, C so. I think the Royals will do okay. They have, they have several pitchers that had badly years last year C and they are, they're these, F uh, cycle pitchers, they, they pitch one year bad, one year good, one beer bad, one year good. Saberhagen has won, F uh, supposedly the Cy, I think he won Cy year, F uh, two out of three years, C and, F uh, D you know, C so he's very much due for a good year. D Well D now D see that's a good question, I, that's, I don't know how Oakland's going to react to being, F uh, swept in the World Series last year. They could very easily, F uh, take that as a challenge. Which is the way most teams nat, D you know, naturally do. F Uh, and, and, just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them, C so, Uhhuh. F Oh yeah, baseball is there, is there life up there like football is down here I think. I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis, yeah. Yeah, that's true too, <laughter>. I think that's all that they have. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah, F oh yeah, I, I definitely do, in fact I've got family that still lives up there. F Um, from what I hear from everybody up there, they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go. C But I've been following Spring training C and they're D like one of the best teams in spring training so far. That, D well it can be. It, it really kind of depends on, on, F um, what they were, D you know, what they were looking for. In other words, if, if in Spring cra, training they were looking at all their kids, like a lot of them do, F um, then it really doesn't give you any indication. C But if they were, F uh, playing the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good indication, C so, D you know, it's, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just, D you know, come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani, training and then gone on a, D you know, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season C so, Exactly, yeah. You can't. Right, th, I think the best thing that you can do is go with, F um, the players that are, that have the talent to do the best years. And, F um, that they hadn't had these, F uh, gigantic, F uh, career years yet and, and just kind of assume that, D you know, so, one of them is going to break through eventually, C so. C And I, I think they said the Reds, F um, this last year, I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years. D You know, C and, C and so they may be even be, better this year. F Uh, that's a good question. I, the Rangers have a, have a pitching problem C and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question. They're doing the right thing, though, F uh, they are going with their farm system. They're letting their farm system, F uh, build up and stuff like that C and, Uhhuh. No. Uhhuh. F Um, that's probably true. D Well considering what I've seen in the last, F uh, D you know, two seasons, I'm beginning to agree with that, yeah. C But E I mean, you don't have to spend the big money, as far as I'm concerned to, F uh, to win. You just have to spend it if it's necessary. In other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team, then keep him there. Don't let him go away. C And I think that's really what's been hurting, F uh, the, F uh, Rangers. F Oh yeah, they, they spent more money, last year than any other team in the, in the league C and they were, D you know, toward the bottom of the league. F Uh, C so it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you, F uh, winning a pennant. It really doesn't, C so. F Uh, you got me. I, D you know, I think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go C and once you do that, you lose everything, E I mean. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. That, that's the whole point. There are so many games in, in a year that they've got to have repeat customers. They can't afford not to, C and, D you know, that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done, F um, E I mean, their, D you know, their ticket prices are, D you know, kin, I guess as high as anybody else's C but what, somehow or another they, attract, F uh, so many people from, som, E I mean they're a, it's a small market C and yet they attract as many if not more than most, F uh, F uh, most, other cities, C so. Well what are the others? D Well it's helpful. D Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff? D Well there's, there's a guy on, that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does, F uh, F uh, it's essentially trivial statistics C but they've got a st, it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games. C And apparently the Rangers last year, won a lot of one run games. D Well, it, it, it is C but it's the, it's, it's a reverse indicator. D Well what the, what the argument is C and it, it, it, it's one of these statistical, gee, how can you draw a conclusion from it, C but they find that, tha, tha, there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year. C And, F uh, it's strangely enough, it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year. Which means that if you have a good year winning one ru, one run games that the following year, you'll have a bad year. C And they, they've got, F um, they've looked at I think twentythree teams, F uh, C and, C and, the, F uh, statistics are something like twentyone out of twentythree. It was, which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year, I, F uh, D Well, E I mean, C and it's, F uh, F uh, I don't know, what do you, what do you think of Incaviglia's loss. D Well it, it's an interesting concept, though, when you look at, F uh, of, of how baseball, how apparently, I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him. C And, F uh, C and the point of, of, I guess, I don't understand the, the strategy of how baseball works, C but it seems that, D you know, they can sign him tomorrow, C and he could go in the team the next day, C and, C and, C and they put him in the lineup C and he hits a home run C and all of a sudden he becomes a hero. C And, C and all he has to do is hit the ball, E I mean, you're not, a, C and all he has to do is one, D you know, hit it once. It doesn't, he can, he can stri, he can swing a couple times, if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can. It's an interesting, F uh, an interesting concept of, of how they do it. C But I agree with you I think that, I think that's part of what, F uh, baseball needs more of. I, F uh, I, I guess what bothers me is, is that when you go, F um, you wait and wait and wait C and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run C and that's all the game is. I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people, Yes. Yeah, well how do you think the Royals are going to do? D Well are they going to beat, are they going to beat Oakland? Yeah. D Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time C and I watch, I, I watch their sports up there C and they're, F uh, they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they, Y, did you actually live in Saint Louis? Ye, everybody does, right. I had a friend from college that lives in, F uh, it's D well, I should say on the west side, E I mean everything's on the west side. Manchester? F Uh, out that way, C and I went and visited him, C but anyway, it is interesting. D Well how are the Cardinals? Do you still keep up with them, or someth, D Well is that a good indicator? D You know what I think is remarkable is, F uh, it seems that what you really need to do to win though, is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have, have, have real breakthrough years. C And, C and the question is how do you forecast that, if you had to, if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series, E I mean it would be really tough. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, D well when are the Rangers going to come through th, D Well is there enough money, that's part of it, I, F uh, that was part of Skip Bayless' argument. I don't know if you read Skip Bayless, but a, a local commentary C and, his argument is that F uh, the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to, to bring in the big dollars. Would you, would you agree with that? F Uh. Yeah. D Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff. Yeah. D Well C and that, I think that's maybe part of it that, that the, F um, C and it, D you know, if I owned the team. I think you'd like them to do well C but the question of losing big, big money that what, did, did, did Steinbrenner actually make money on the, D Well it's, it, it, D yeah, it's a little bit like any other sport, D you know. When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game C and, F uh, D you know, E I mean, I, I guess as we get older, i, you're probably going, if, if you, if you compare to go to a, a sport, a, a D say you go to a rock concert, or, or even a performance, a, an opera or the symphony or something, F uh, if, D you know, i, C but how, how often do you do that. An I, I, I would, I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there, D you know, several times a, Yeah. Yeah, C but don't you think there's a, there, there are older fans there. I, I don't mean older, F um, D you know, the fact that, that it's, it's a better established and that the, the city is, is, is more, of a...
