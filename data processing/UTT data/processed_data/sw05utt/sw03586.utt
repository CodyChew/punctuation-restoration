I'm sorry, F um hobbies. Let me see, I don't know if that took or not, I'll do it again. <Beep> Okay. What are your hobbies? I hear you have kids, right? <Laughter> That's your full time, F uh, hobby, right? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it <laughter>. D Well, no, not <laughter> really. Yeah, I, I have, D you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be. C So, I always try. I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity. F Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm, Yeah, D well, it isn't and it is. It is, D you know, actually the sewing isn't the hard part, it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room. Yeah, I've been doing that C and, That, yeah, that, C but usually have to do the pleats by hand. C So that, at least I can do, D you know, watching T V or whatever C but, Yeah, C and I've, I've gone and, D you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times <laughter>, trying to get it through C but, Yeah, C so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it. I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish. Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby. F Um, yes and no. It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you. That's, you don't have to do as much as, as I thought. In fact, my problem, I had fish as a kid C and they always died immediately, C and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean C because you have, Right, you need to let the bacteria build up, C and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance. C And I would just take everything out and just D like, D you know, wash it with scalding hot water C and it would kill all the bacteria, C and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again C so. Right. That's right. C So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing C and I don't try and sterilize things <laughter>. That's right. That's right. D Well, I've had them, I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here, C and then back at home I used to have a small, D you know, five gallon tank. C But that never worked well. C And, I have fiftyfive gallons now. It's a lot easier. No <laughter>. No, not yet. That's right, I really do. C But, D you know. Yeah, I just have, D you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things. I don't get into the right, right. The expensive ones. They are. They're very expensive C and, D you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment. You lost an investment C so, No, not really. Only if there's baby fish. You always have to isolate those. You get a D well, no, they have breeders. It's a little plastic things that sort of floats C and you put the mother fish in there C and then it's got D like a trough underneath her C so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough C and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either. C And that's, D you know, it kind of works, C but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate C and on occasion if you get a real small one, it'll fit out the slots. That's right, C so. C But, D you know, it works, I guess. F Oh, they'll eat them. Yeah. Yes. It, C and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies. F Oh, no. All the time, C and, F um, I, C and she's supposed to, her variety, it says they won't eat the babies, C and I've seen her do it. C So. F Oh, it's ter, D well, it makes you understand that, D you know, things are different <laughter>. We might, D right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't, C but D you know, that's the way it is for them. Yeah. That's it. Yes, C because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide. D So. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, not really. I, I try. I also, I play a couple of instruments. That's okay, I didn't hear. Okay. Okay. You heard her in the background <laughter>. That's babies. Takes a lot of time, F huh. I like, F uh, most sports. I like to do that. I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing. F Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while. What do you like to do? D Well, I'm sure you probably are. <Laughter> You like it, that's the main. <Laughter>. That's right. <Laughter>. F Oh, boy, that's hard sewing. Measure it and get it to, D Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it. If you get pleats and all kinds of, That's a lot of work. Oh. Right, right. <Laughter>. That feels really good. To do it, right. Keeping fish. D Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they. F Oh, no. How much that bothers you, C and you probably have to clean out the tank too. F Oh, no. F Oh, you're kidding C because they need to have a little bit of the, I see. F Oh, no. C And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably. Right, right. Don't go through the whole nine yards C and they kind of need a little bit of that. C So you've had fish for a long time. What size do you have now? F Oh, that's a good size. Have you ever had it, F uh, crack or break or leak. <Laughter>. Fiftyfive gallons, you'd hope it would never do that. Do you have all kinds of different fish C or, Uhhuh. Real exotic. D Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of C and, Yes, I bet it is. Do you have problems with them, F uh, the fish eating each other? Right. Then you have to, how do you isolate them? A jar or something C or. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. Right. It'll go through the slot. That works all right then. They don't, F uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either. They will. Isn't that odd. You wouldn't think that. You're kidding. C And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it? Things are different in the animal kingdom, F huh. Yeah. That's kind of the way they do it. Survival of the fittest or something. Right. Go hide from them, D well C and then, you think, D well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that, C but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies. <Laughter>.
