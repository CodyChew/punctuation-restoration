Okay, D so we've got to talk about music. C And, F um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind? No, not a seventies baby. Is it disco, or is it like, <Laughter> C but, F Oh, okay. C So, C so they can get D like the Doors and Led Zepplin. Yeah, that's cool. C And, how about the Rolling Stones? F Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured. How about, F um, Pink Floyd? Okay. C So, C so then we got, we got some same things C because, No, it's very hard C because, D see, D well, E I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, D you know, I listen to heavy metal or classic rock. We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock. D Like, for example, let's see, F uh, Bad Company, what, D well, they're like, for example, A C D C. Why, have you heard of them? Okay. C And, stuff like that. That's, that's, that's not really hard rock. Okay. D Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal. C But, D see, for example, they have, D see what, C but other bands consider it D like really hard rock. It's like brash metal, which all they do is D like, they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar, C and the guitar is set D like, really low, C and, what happens is D like, F oh, everybody gets D like totally into the music C and then they start dancing around, C and they just bump into each other, D like, D like they hit each other with their shoulders, C and, then, you knock people down, C and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people. No, I don't like that music. C But, that's, that's what they do. That's, that's what some people call D like really heavy metal. C And, D see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also. D Like really, D like heavy metal, wo, is considered, D like the words heavy metal C and, D like, you always thought about, D like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that. C And, just hard rock has, they, they don't talk about that, they just talk about, D like, life in general. Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them. Yeah. Okay, D well, no. I said Queen's Reich, C but, C but, F oh, C but you got to D like Queen also. D So C because, Yeah, especially, F uh, F oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera? Don't they have a, no let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in the background. Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody. Yeah, that, that was great. I heard that the other day on the radio C and I pumped it up. C Because, E I mean, I just love that song. Yeah, C but they had, that, that whole record was pretty good. C But then, they started going downhill like everybody else. Yeah, they're, they're still around, they've got a ne, new C D out, C but I, I wouldn't buy it. C Because D see, what happens is, the old, D see whe, I like, I like the old Rolling Stones. I don't like the new stuff. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins. An old, Genesis? C And, C and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this, C and then he came out with, F uh, D see, for example, his, his record D like, No Jacket Required. That was good, C but it was on his way of going downhill, C because he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone, C and then he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, F uh, Genesis C and that really, D like now, I hate Phil Collins, I can't stand him. C Because, I look at him C and I say, D you know, you were singing at this time, and with these people, C and you were great, C and now you're singing all this stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record, it's still going to be a number one hit. C And so, that's, that's what gets me mad. C But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie? Yeah. I saw it when it opened. Yeah. D Well, it, it's, D you know, it's like, I was watching Siskel and Ebert, D you know, D like those guys that criticize movies? C And, they both loved the movie, right? They said the music's great, it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that. C And then, one of them said, D well, everything is great, C but I'm going to give it thumbs down. C And they go, C but why? C Because it's D like, the end is, D like, really depressing. C And so, C But it, C but it's D like the movie is so well made, C and the music that goes with it just picks you up, D see, I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred sixtynine. C So, E I mean, C so for me, No, C but you learn to. E I mean it's just that, D like the, the sixties music's got a lot to say. I, I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too. D You know, I was like, Hey, C but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants, <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Did, did you go to college? F Oh, that's cool. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. D Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in progression, ever in history. C So, No, about everything. C So, it's like, nothing happened during the seventies. Everything happened during the sixties, the seventies I don't know what they're called, D you know, it's like, like the, the eighties are called, D like the progressive years, or the, or, D you know, D like the technology years, because of all the computers and stuff. C But the seventies got nothing. E I mean, nobody cared to name it <laughter>. D So. Yeah, I know. <Laughter> Can you imagine the, D like a big picture of John Travolta, tada, what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER? Him just standing there. Yeah, that's a good example to look for in history. D Well, from now on we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixtynine when they took the first step on the moon, to nineteen eighties. Okay, what happened in the middle? Don't worry, don't worry, you're not, you're not missing anything, D you know, C so, Yeah, really. C And, that's, that's why I guess, everybody, yeah, it's like they don't want to talk about that, C so they just, don't name it. E I mean, it was, it was, I guess it was pretty bad times. F Oh, D well, let's see, yeah, okay, we've been talking for seven minutes, C so, Okay, all right, D so F um, I'm going to leave you alone. F Uh what, what are you doing? Do you have a family? Okay. F Oh, I'm sorry. F Oh, okay. Okay. All right. D So then, F uh, have fun doing this. It is not, that bad. Bye, bye. Okay. F Oh, I guess the stuff <baby_crying> that was done more in the seventies, because that's, D Well, D no that's really when I grew up, C so that's really what I like better, is that kind of music <laughter>, E I mean, No, no, no, not that kind of music <laughter>. No, more like, F uh, rock, F um, D you know, like Led Zepplin type <laughter>. Right. Right. F Oh, sure, sure I went to their concert last year when they were here. Sure, yeah, I like them. Okay, D well, I just didn't know that much about music C and I wasn't sure what kind of music. What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about? What, Okay, D like, give me some examples. F Oh, D well, Bad Cam, Company's not bad, that's not, <Laughter> Yeah, A C D C <laughter>. Yes <laughter>. D Well, okay. Okay, I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal. E I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like Cinderella, D you know. D Well, D see, I don't really care for Cinderella <laughter>. C But, I like A C D C's okay. Yeah. No, I don't really care for that too much, I guess. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Is that the kind of music that you like? F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay. Yeah. Right. F Oh, sure. Of course. Que, you, you're talking Queen, is that what you said? F Oh, F oh, F oh, okay, Right. D Well sure, C because Queen was real popular when I was growing up. Oh! F Um, F uh, Right, right, yeah, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, that, that was a real good one. D Well, that's true. They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that. Of the Stones? Yeah. I agree. That's the ne, the older stuff is the best of it. The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I, don't really care for today's rock and roll too much. Right. Yes, definitely. I agree. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. No, not yet. I guess I've been, con, kind of considering it. Have you seen it yet? Was it really good? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, okay. C So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then. Right. D Well no, D now, D well seventies music, E I mean, I'm, like I said, yo, disco, I don't like disco, I've never liked disco. <Laughter> D Well, that's true <laughter>. That's true. C But, I was more in the late seven, D well, I shou, D like mid to late seventies, D like between seventyfive and, and, seventynine, was more my era. D Well, no. I'm going right now <laughter>. C But F uh, no I didn't go then. C But D see, I graduated high school in seventyeight, C so, D you know, in seventyeight, D you know rock was starting to get really heavy, D you know, C and real, F um, I don't know, disco was pretty much dead by then. C So, C so that's what I mean, disco wasn't really my time. About music? F Oh. Okay. Uhhuh. That's kind of funny <laughter>. You're right. I never thought of that. The disco years, that's what they're calling them, are gone. Yeah, right. <Laughter> That's true. D Well, except for Vietnam. You know with, Yeah. D Well, that's very true <laughter>. C But, F Oh, good. I haven't even been keeping track. F Uh, yeah. We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper, C but it's not a big deal, I just left it. No, it's okay, C because D see I didn't, D see somebody tried to call me last night C but I didn't have my number yet, I just got it today. C And so, D you know, it's okay.
