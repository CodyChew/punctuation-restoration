F Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf. I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time C and that's how I picked up golf. C And, F uh, I don't know it's just a, kind of a challenging game. Uhhuh. I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play. I'm trying to get back into it. F Uh, C so, F uh, I got to start all over again. It's not like riding a bicycle. You do tend to, forget. <<Very faint>> Oh. Yeah. <Throat_clearing> What is your handicap? Okay. F Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago. It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again. Yeah. Yeah. I have got to try and get out there. I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it. I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing> Yeah, that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring <laughter> to, to get back out. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, you always work on trying to improve each day C and, Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, F uh, chip well. One of the two, F uh, C or something would go wrong C but I always managed to, to get near par anyway. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you have, F uh, long waits, F uh, to get on the course? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I just moved into this small community C so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here. I'm hoping that won't be, cou, I, was from the, F uh, twin cities area. Yeah <laughter>. Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather? Yeah. D Well, I wish that's all we had. Oh. <Cough> Yeah <noise>. I see. D Well, at least it, that doesn't, F uh, get in the way of golfing C so that <noise>, <Noise> Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, that's what they do here sometimes. You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there C but, if you got, It sure is. I play at least three times a week. I'm on it, No. D Well, I'm one of those rare lefthanded golfers. C And I do enjoy playing. Right now it's three. D Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down. F Uh, D well, we can usually play here year around. Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play. C But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play, C and I'm pretty much addicted to golf, C so. I get out there one way or the other. It's a good game though. It's very challenging C and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself. That's the way I look at it. I, I play in, in lo, a lot of groups C and C but I, they keep score and, between themselves C but I really don't care. F Um, I go out C and each shot I say, D well, this is what I'm going to try to do C and then I see how close I can come to that. Yeah, C and i, inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another. Either I'm not driving very well C or I'm not hitting long irons very well C or I'm not putting well C or, C but sometimes it all comes together. D Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst. C And I went to that. Craig Statler won in a playoff. C But we, F uh, this is a big golf area. We have a lot of, F uh, I'd say we probably have <breathing> within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst C and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year. Yes, we do as a matter of fact. It, it, F uh, it's only been that way in the last five years. C But now you, F uh, most of the courses have a, F uh, two day advance tee time you have to call, <Cough>. <Cough>. <Cough>. <Cough>. <Cough> That's some cold golf too, isn't it? <Cough>. <Cough> We have cold. Usually January and the first two weeks of February. C But, F uh, last week we were in the seventies. Something is coming through now C so it's like in the low forties right now. C But, F uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties. We have very windy winters <Cough> and very cold. C But we don't get any snow anymore. I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern. We used to get four or five inches a year. Now we get nothing. It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall. No, C but I have played golf in the snow before. Get out my orange golf ball and go out.
