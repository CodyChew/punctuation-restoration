F Um, C so do you have a personal computer? Oh <laughter>. Yeah, that's what, when this subject was mentioned to us I said, D well, I went, gee, that's all I use mine for is a word processor, C and I haven't used it since I got out of college, C and that was six years ago, C but it, it was my sister's who, my sister bought it C and, F uh, my father had a small business C and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business, C and he never did, he always did everything out by hand. He only had three employees, C so, D you know, it wasn't really worth it to him to do, to do it. Yeah, like pay, the payroll C and, yeah, basically payroll. Yeah. F Um, it's an I B M, I think it's a Professional Three Hundred, no, that's, that's the digital one. It's an, F uh, I B M P C Junior, I think. Yeah she, she, F uh, she uses it now, F uh, my sister, to, actually, she moved C and my father wasn't using it, She took it with her, because she needed it to do, she just finished up her Bachelor's degree C so I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore. It, it's, Yeah. F Oh, yeah, that's, that's neat, that's, a very good use. <Breathing> Yeah. D Well, I know there, there's got to be a lot of uses, C but <breathing> it's just y, you have, to have a need. Yeah, C but you have to have a need. I really have no need for it at all, <Breathing> F um, I work for Digital Equipment <Breathing> C and we have a powerful computer down at work. No, C and I, I still really don't do that much, as you say, play games on it <laughter>, they're great for playing games. My brother, Yeah. I know some people who just, they just went through a course, F uh, and took the electronic grafting course, drafting, not grafting, <Laughter> but drafting course, the C A D. Yeah, C and that's really neat, E I mean, yeah, you can do graphs, graphs on it too, C but this is, D you know, this is one step above it, C but it's actual, F um, drafting, C and I always, <Breathing> Yeah, C and the computer does it all for you. <Breathing> C So it was really neat. I wanted to go to that course, C but <breathing> my boss wouldn't pay for it, I'm like, I'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it, I'll be needed. C Because, F um, I, I, I didn't want to go do it myself C because I didn't think I was really going to use it. <Cough> I got this cough, I've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and I went outside with no coat on. Yeah, it was bad. Yes, it was a big change. You couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot, C and then, again, I picked up a cold. <Cough> C But I'm doing all right, getting over it. C So I don't, I don't even know how much, F um, personal computers cost nowadays. Yeah, they can't do your, F um, your drafting and your graphs, and all of that. <Cough>. Yeah? You do run in, you do run into limitations on yours? F Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow, that's neat that you ev, you even reach the limits of yours. I haven't even begun to reach the limits, Junior, yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. They, say that Commodore has made a good, F um, P C for the price, though. Very competitive. I don't even, I don't even know much money my sister spent on hers, C but I, I just thought I, it's, it's going to be a waste, she's not going to do it, not going to use it. F Oh, D well. Yeah. D Well, she likes it, she gets to write her reports, C but like I say, she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted. Yeah, a typewriter with memory would, <<pause>> would have been fine, it's all she ev, uses it for. F Um, I think it might have a spelling editor on it, I'm not sure. F Um, Yeah. Yeah, that's one of, the one great thing about it <laughter>. F Um, no, I, I really don't, it's, it was six years ago. She pretty much set it up. She goes, here, this is, you make your file, <breathing> and then you can, F uh, edit it. Right? F Um, I used the one, the one at work a lot, F um, matter of fact, anything I've had to write from now on, <breathing> I had to ca, <breathing> God forbid, write a couple of resumes, C and I was just great, C and all you have to do is just put it in a, F uh, the sp, spelling check mode, C And <laughter> I don't even have to look my, my words up anymore. Oh, Okay, good. Okay. Yeah, D well, bye. <Breathing> F Uh, D well we do have one in, in our home, F uh, it's on the fritz right now, because the monitor isn't working properly C but, <breathing> F uh, it has been, F uh, used tremendously, mostly by my children <breathing> for, F uh, playing games <breathing>. However, <laughter> F um, D you know, the bane of our existence these days, <breathing> F uh, C but it does have a word processing program, which all of us have used for <breathing> re, reports and papers and that sort of thing. F Oh, wow. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Actually, it would be worth it, if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand. Exactly, C and there are, lots of them on the market. <Breathing> C But you do have to research that, find out what works for your system <breathing>. What kind do you have? F Oh, D well, that's a nice computer. Uhhuh, C so she took it with her <laughter>. Yeah, don't blame her. Uhhuh. Yeah <breathing>. F Oh, D well, D well, encourage her to try other things, C because, <breathing> F um, I am, F uh, I work in a school system, C and I teach writing C and <breathing> we use the computers a great deal for word processing, <breathing> D you know, because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer, as you probably found out yourself, <Breathing> C but, F um, I also am sponsoring a literary magazine, C and we're doing our entire layout on the computer <breathing>, F uh, because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have, a publishing program <breathing>. C So, it is wonderful, once you get into some of the programs <breathing> that are out now, you can do so much with them, that you don't do until you really make yourself use them. You have to make yourself do it, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Oh <laughter> C so, you don't need a personal one <laughter>? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right. <Breathing> D Well, my son is, F uh, studying electronic technology, C and he's been able to do things on <breathing>, F uh, on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his, <breathing> F um, reports, and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way. F Um, C and I guess it, if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful, C but, <breathing> F um, unless it is, I guess it's kind of a waste. F Oh, that's, fascinating. Uhhuh. Yeah, I knew what you meant, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, you can do wonderful design. It, it's really, s, D well, especially when <breathing> anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering w, F uh, dr, drawing, <breathing> F um, <breathing> you have to be so precise. Yeah. F Oh, D well <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Breathing> F Oh, boy <laughter>. What a change, huh? Yeah. Right. D Well, that's good. <Breathing> D Well, they vary tremendously. F Um, C because you can get C because you're, they're, F uh, the ones that were made a few years ago, <breathing> F uh, have come down in price significantly, <breathing> F um, you can get them, I've seen them for five, and six hundred dollars, C but they 're much less, <breathing> F um, have much less memory, and capable, of much less. no, you can't do very much on them. Right. Right. F Um, D well, it's just that you have to have, F uh, you have to be able to get your program in, C and, C and, m, many of the programs are so big, <breathing> F uh, they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work. You don't have any, bytes left <breathing> C but, F um, if you, F um, if, if you want to go into one that's really useful, <breathing> you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars, C and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much, <breathing> C an, C and we've, ours is not quite that powerful, C and so, D you know, we are, we are limited, which may be one reason why, F Oh, yeah, uhhuh, some things we can't do, <breathing> C but, C but then we haven't needed to either, D you know, F um, C but we've been able to do what we can. <Laughter> No, C but I, mine is not as good as a P C, F uh, F uh, Junior, yeah. Yeah, ours is a Commodore One Twentyeight. <Lipsmack> C And it, it's not quite as, F um, as useful, not quite as powerful. C So, <Breathing> They did, yeah, that's very true, that's very true, they did. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Sounds like he, that you were right <laughter>. Yeah. C And she could have bought a typewriter also <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it, yeah, it prob, if, sh, if it doesn't she could easily put it on. Yeah, right. Right. Which program did you use? Did you use Word Perfect? F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, they're great, you're right <breathing>. D Well, I guess we've spent our time. I need to go help my daughter do something, C so this has been fun talking to you. Good luck. F Uh, byebye.
