<Throat_clearing> I guess, I guess by what you said you're, you don't feel you're, F uh, privacy has been inva, invaded anytime recently? Uhhuh. Right. F Uh, no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. F Uh, D you know, I would, there, there's a lot of times though, F uh, you get those calls and, D you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or, or whatnot C and, D you know, next thing you know, F uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or that C and it's real hard to, to tell them, D you know, that you're not interested. C Or you do tell them you're not interested C and they still keep asking you, D you know, and keep badgering you about it, C and that aggravates me. C But I don't know that you could call that invading of, invading my privacy C because, <throat_clearing> D you know, if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, D you know, I want my name unlisted or want my, D you know, It doesn't? Uhhuh. Oh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Huh. <Laughter> Good grief. D Well, let me ask you about this. Here's something that, F uh, has been kind of concerning me lately. My fiance received a bill from a, a Lord and Taylor company, F Uh, D you know, they're a, they're a department store. She received a bill from them, F uh, that she had visited some sto, C and, C and I think it was there in Florida, maybe it was in Miami. That, F uh, she had visited a store there C and, F uh, they had this bill, F uh, that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise, F uh, over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise. F Uh, C and the date that, that she supposedly made this purchase, she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving. F Uh, C and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number. F Uh, C and, C and I've, I've heard recently that, F uh, F uh, that this is a common occurrence where people are using s, D you know, they use Joe Blow's so, F uh, social security number, F uh, and can, F uh, potentially ruin someone's credit. <Laughter>. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, y, Yeah. Yeah. D Well, we got it cleared up eventually. What happened, F uh, No, not really. F Uh, F u, th, F uh, th, the only thing that annoys me is when, F uh, people call and they, F uh, you have solicitation calls. That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy <laughter>. F Uh, <<pause>> do you feel that yours is invaded? C But, C but that doesn't work. F Uh, no, C because they, a lot of times they dial sequentially. They get your name from, F uh, if you enter any type of contest or anything. F Uh, D you know, you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something, you put your phone number on there, they pass your phone number on to another company. F Uh, C or you, F uh, C or, C or D like the newspapers, they just dial randomly or s, and stuff. They even call, the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe <laughter>. C And, F uh, while I was subscribing to the paper, I got so upset at them that they you call me one more time, I'm going to stop subscribing <laughter>. C And the lo, local, local papers ask them to remove your na, number from their list C and, F uh, yeah, you call up their regular, during regular hours their, F uh, they have a special department, they'll take your numbers out of their lists. F Uh, C but the, F uh, Orlando paper, F uh, D yeah, they, they refused to take it off of the lists C and they call every month. C And when you have more than one phone number, you get a call on each number you have <laughter>. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address, i, and their mother's maiden name <laughter>, F uh, you can, basically, become that, F uh, person. F Uh, if the purchase was made mail order, they should have a record of where it was shipped to C and since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, D you know, that it wasn't her. F Uh, if it was some D you know, coming into the store and stuff, then she would ha, whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of, F uh, D you know, document C and, F uh, wh, the signature, F uh, they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature C and if they can't provide a signature, D you know, they'll have to eat the charge <laughter>. C But if the pers, has, D you know, their social s, her social security number, I'd be real concerned that they, F uh, that she's not, F uh, blacklist on, F uh, Tel, what is it, it's Telecredit or something? F Uh, C because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there. She probably won't be ab, able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle.
