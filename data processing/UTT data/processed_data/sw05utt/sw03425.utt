Hi, my name is Donna, C and I'm calling, calling from Plano, Texas. F Oh, okay, F um, I, F um, find exercise kind of a task, I guess I'd say. I go to aerobics <child_yelling> two days a week, C but I also have <child_yelling> three kids at home C so they keep me pretty busy. Yeah, that gives me plenty of exercise, C but I enjoy, F um, <child_yelling> walking outside and <child_yelling> bicycling once in a while with the family. Excuse me <noise> <<muffled sound as if hand over the phone>>. That's fine. And yourself. Uhhuh, every morning. D Well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves doing yeah, he does it every day like a ritual. Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, F um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go, C but he goes, F um, every, every day, C and then he ru, he's a runner, too. He runs three mornings a week he gets up about five and, and does his, his deal, C and some days he doesn't, C but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run. C And, F um, we. Oh. The, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here, C and I know, F um, F uh, we, we both of, my husband and I both do it to just <child_yelling> keep the pounds off. We're getting up in age, I guess, in our late thirties C so we need to keep exercising just to be able to, F uh. F Oh, I know. Yeah, I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week, C and I take my three year old with me. There's a nursery there. C And it's kind of another day out for her to, F um, have little friends, C and, F um, I, I enjoy the socialization of it, D you know, getting to see the same women every morning, C but F um, there are some parts during that exercise that I think, I cannot do <laughter> another second of this. It is. That's true, that's true. D Well. Okay, D well. Yes, thank you for participating. Thank you. Bye. I'm Jay in Dallas. That keeps you plenty of exercise. D Well, I, F uh, I have, I walked and run ev, F um, almost every morning. I've sort of stopped here with the weather change, C but, F uh, it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning. F Oh, that would, that's fantastic exercise. F Um. All right. I'd rather get a bicycle, C but I have an ex, I had an exercise bike in the house, but didn't seem to use it enough, C so somebody sold it in a garage sale, C and so, F uh C but I'd like to get a bike and just do, F uh, do biking outside. Yeah. It keeps going, C because I'm fiftyfive, C and it, F uh, it just gets worse. You still want to eat, C and, F uh C but you just, I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that, C but, F uh. Uhhuh. Right. Oh. I know it, it, it, some of it is so tough C and, F uh, especially when somebody's, F uh, planning lunch for you and they know what, what's good for you, I think when we do it ourselves, we take the easy way sometimes. C So. D So anyway thank you for calling. All right. Byebye.
