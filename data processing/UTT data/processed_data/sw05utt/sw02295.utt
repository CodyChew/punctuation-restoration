All right. D Well, on this subject, I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet, C but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home C so I've always been involved, D you know, in one. <Breathing> D Well, I've D Well, I can kind of see both sides, D you know, <laughter> I really can. F Uh, nursing homes to me, I would personally be the last resort D you know, I rea, D you know if I had to put someone in there. Yeah, if it's a have to thing, yeah, I, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I kind of think that's true, too. I guess, because it's so under staffed, D you know that's like everything else, though. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, C but, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know, I've always, D well, my sister's involved in one also, C and I really think they really do a wonderful job. C But still there's those little things that happens, D you know there really is, which I think, it's a wonderful place, D you know, if it comes to that, D you know, if you just can't take care of them any more. Uhhuh, that's it. Uhhuh. Other things. Yeah, yeah, yeah C but I think when the time comes, I, I hope to have the time to really look around, D you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at. I do too. Outside's awful deceiving sometimes D you know. Yeah. Yeah. Ca, yeah. Yeah. Off, yeah. To, no. Uhhuh, C and everything you worked so hard for all your life yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Now there is some really nice ones. There's also, D you know, some private ones, D you know C but of course, I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that, D you know, that's way out of my reach. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh the very same, yeah. No, C but I, there's, I think there's ways around it, though, that, D you know, D like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something D you know. C But still, a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that. D You know, it's their money. D You know, that's how I feel about it, anyway. Yes. Yeah, my mother's seventy now, C so naturally she's retired, C but she's still on her own, E I mean. I think that's wonderful, I really do, just as long as they can, C and then on the other hand, I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy D you know. Uhhuh, they're not lonely. F Oh, yes, uhhuh. Yeah. No. Around, yeah. C But I really don't know what the other solution would be D you know, I really don't. C But no, when the time comes I'm really, hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents really do, C because I have been raised in one, D you know, C so there's lot of things I know to look for. C And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either D you know <laughter>. I really don't. It really would, yes, yes, C and like I said, my sister's still in it, C and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either. <Laughter> F Oh. D Well, it's been nice talking to you. C And I guess we'd better get back to work, F huh. All right. Byebye. Uhhuh. How do you feel about them, E I mean, since you've kind of been close to that. Uhhuh. D Well, I've had a touch of experience. My, F um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him C and, F uh, she put him in, C but he wasn't there very long before he died C but, F um, I guess, F um, the one time that I saw him there, D you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay. C But, F um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, D you know keep him real out of it all the time C and that's always kind of bothered me. Uhhuh. I have a sisterinlaw who runs a nursing home, C but I've never actually been there C and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow, D you know, a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about. C But still I'm sure there are, D you know, aspects to it that aren't really desirable. Yeah. D Well, sometimes you don't have any other alternative family and friends are usually, D well family's tied up with their own lives and things, and usually working C and it's hard to, Yes. Uhhuh, I think that's important, too, in fact there's a, Yes. There's one close to where my mother is, C but in order to get in, you have to be able to, F um, walk in on your own, in other words, you can't be in, D you know, too bad a shape to start out with. C But then if you deteriorate, F um, they have a separate section for those who need care D you know, all the time. C But it's always, D well, C and they have a long waiting list, too. C So there's always this feeling of, D well, golly gee, D you know, you've got to be able to walk in the door, C so you can't wait until you're too bad off C but then, you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because D like, F uh, you have to give up your automobile or whatever. Yeah C and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things, then you feel like, D well, gee, I'm, D you know, I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment. C So it's kind of a, that's a hard one, C but it is a very nice nursing home. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's the problem the expense of it all is, C and, F uh, what I, another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately. C But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. D You know <laughter>. C So I don't like that aspect. Yeah. That's right. D Well, yeah, I've talked to my mother about that several times lately, C and I, I said, I want you to have control of your own business. C But, D you know, what if. Yeah, yeah, my mother's, F uh, seventyfive and still has her own home and everything. Yeah. That's true. They have a lot of people around to do things with. Some of those places have wonderful activities and things, D you know, lots of stuff going on. C And they'll take them places D so. I don't know, it's not all bad C but I guess once you get ill, then, D you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things. No. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. That might be kind of tough, F huh. <Laughter>. D Well, you too. Okay. Bye.
