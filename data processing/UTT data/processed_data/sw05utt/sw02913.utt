They did that didn't they C and they marked off routes that they could go or something <laughter>. We've got two bathrooms C but, D well i, mi, actually, if he takes, my house kind of looks like two trailers put together. C And one bathroom is at the end of one side C and one's in the middle of the other, C so we could do it. No, C and he could climb out the window <laughter>. Wh, C and we, our whole house has, D you know, every room leads to three rooms, C so we can, D you know yeah, you can get around <laughter>. You just can't go out the front door honey, sorry.

It's a child's movie, C but, F oh, it's good, I enjoyed it. Yeah, I do too C and, Yeah, yeah. C And, F uh, D well it's about this little boy who, F uh, I think he's up in a attic, or some part of school. He got locked in the school C and he got scared, C but he starts dreaming C and then, F uh, he's saving the land of, F uh, F oh, it's been so long since I've seen it. All I know, all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing, it flies through the air. C And he's trying to save the land from some, ooze <laughter>. C But it's really good, E I mean it sounds ki, it, it had, F uh, Fred Savage in it. No, no, no, no, no. Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it, though, with, F uh, F oh, he had, F uh, F uh, F oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE. You didn't see that, that was cute, that was real, that was a good one. I, I like, I like slapstick comedy. Yeah, D well I heard, a friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night C and she said that was hilarious. Two and a half <laughter>. It wa, yeah, I want to see that. She said she rented it last night C and said it was real good C an, D Now, I seen that, was that with that blonde, she pretended to be the boss or something. Yeah, I rented that one night by myself. I was home alone. Did you see HOME ALONE? <Laughter>. Gosh, I like just about anything. We, I think the last one we saw was, F uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO. D Well, we don't have any kids C but we like them anyway. F Um, we're late twenties. No. F Oh, gosh. Oh. <Laughter>. It was, it was actually better than the first one, I thought. What's the last movie you saw? Oh we were just, when, when the topic came up, we, I was asking my husband right quick, what's the last movies we saw. He said D well GHOST and TURTLES. I really liked it. Not too awful bad. Yeah. Did you see PRETTY WOMAN? F Oh, gosh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, once in a while, when I'm home. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it does. Yeah. I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN, it was, it was really a, it made you feel really good. It was just a happy movie. Yeah, I saw that one. I, I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was. Yeah. I don't like that. I don't see why they have to do that, E I mean, E I mean n, everybody knows that it, that the, the language is there so they could just ignore it and, D you know, use different words instead, I think. C But I, I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite. I went and bought the video. I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times. <Laughter> That's okay. That's okay <laughter>. D Now, D Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK, that had, F um, does that have, Molly Ringwald? I think, I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it. I haven't seen it either. I do. F Oh, gosh. Oh. F Huh, I don't know. C Bu, Probably know him if I saw him. I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was, F um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. That, that's, that's Julia Roberts' new movie. Yeah she's, this one, you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance, C and, C and this one was a lot more dramatic. Y, D well, it was D like, F uh, it was a, it was a mystery. She disappeared from her hu, F uh, husband who was abusing her. Yeah, yeah. No, it came out in the theater. C And I think, D you know, around here, it's all ready quit playing. C But I don't, I don't know if it's still playing any where else. C But it was, it was, it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat. F Oh, okay, C because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago. Yeah, he's, F uh, he was a real psycho in the movie. It was, it was scary. Oh yeah, D boy I, I didn't like it. No, it was, I didn't like the way it ended. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Might have been Michael Douglas. F Oh, that starred in it. Yeah, it was Michael Douglas. Huhuh. <Laughter>. It was, I, I, it was, it was weird. It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, that would be kind of hard for us, we've only got one bathroom, I don't know h, <laughter>, <Laughter>. That wouldn't be too bad. <Laughter>. Get around. <Laughter> D Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION? I know it's going to be on, on the, on C B S Tuesday night C an, C and that's kind of what, in a way, D you know, how it kind of bothered you, the way it ended and stuff. That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was. Parts of, parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny C but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious, C and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling, D you know. I I've heard about that C but I don't know what it's about. Yeah. I love Disney movies. E I mean, they're some of the best of, that are made. <Laughter>. Oh go, <Laughter>. I don't think so. Nope, I didn't see that. So do I C and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something C and, C and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than, Yeah, D now, we saw that, C and i, C and they're coming out with a sequel to it. <Laughter> It was funny. C And, C and WORKING GIRL is really good. That was good. Yeah. Yes, I did, that, that just reminded me of that. Did you like it?
