F Uh, D well, F uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team. That's pretty easy to say nowadays <laughter>. Lot easier than it was a couple years ago, C but they had a big win today. F Uh, did you get to watch it? Oh. Are you a Cowboy fan? <Laughter>. Right, yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, they made it to the playoffs finally D like just, D you know, two years ago they were one and fifteen. They won D like just one game C and so pretty fast turnaround. C But this year they made it to playoffs C and today was the first game C and they beat the Chicago Bears C so everybody's really going crazy, D you know, down here. <Laughter> They're going crazy, C so, C so they turned it around, C but, D you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, F uh, E I mean, everybody was real upset, D you know, when they fired Tom Landry, C but, D you know, now it's like, D you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten <laughter> about that. Uhhuh. Right. Right, exactly. D You know. Uhhuh. Right, yeah, F uh, D you know, they have a young team. It's, D you know, a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, D you know, players every year and, D you know, same coach, same everything, C so, now it's, D you know, like a taste of something different. They're all not, D you know, mister nice guys like they used to be. Now it's D like, D you know, tough and dirty team C so everybody is really excited. C And, D Well, it's supposed to be the Redskins, but D you know, we beat them already. We beat them this year in, in Washington C so, D you know, C so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl, C but, D you know, it's just that we have to play every game away, D you know, it's going to be tough, C but, C but every, the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year, C so, E I mean, Atlanta, they're in it, too, C and we beat them C and, F uh, D see, Detroit, we play them next week, C but, D you know, we should beat them. Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them C so, it's, C so everything's, F uh, looking real good. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Right. Yeah, D well the Cowboys are on a roll. They've won, D like, I think six or seven in a row now, C so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the league going into the playoffs C so, Right, yeah, Troy Aikman, he got hurt at O U, C so he transferred to U C L A. Right. Uhhuh. They're playing tonight in fact. I'm watching them on T V right now. C But they're doing some stomping on <laughter> Virginia. Really? D Well, they're doing good tonight. Yeah they're winning. They're winning fortyone to seven. Yeah. Right. C But, yeah, C and, F uh, that's right, Aikman did go to O U. I forgot about that. Yeah, F uh, U C L A. Yeah. C But, the Cowboys did good today. E I mean, I was proud. I thought, I thought they would get beat today because, E I mean they're so young, D you know, playoffs, <Laughter>. No, I didn't. I, F uh, have been at my computer all day C so, D Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan C and, C and, F uh, I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan. <Laughter> Being an Okie <laughter> I just really don't care much, F uh, it's, it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though. They've always been, D you know, my favorite. C But, F uh, C and C and I guess I still have a soft spot. I just hate that that's the coach <laughter> that's leading them. C So, now have they, they're in the playoffs, right? I'll bet they are. F Uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world. Hit a bad season C and it's, D you know, the coach's fault, let's, let's dump him. First good season, the coach can do no wrong. C But they Dallas has always been good ahead, D you know, heading good players and both running, running backs and, and defense. <Laughter>. Who is the competition going to be? Course, I think, D you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal C and, D you know it can be a tot, A or injuries that, F uh, have newly happened C and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played. C But, C but since you have an O U drop out <laughter> as a quarterback, D Well, D Well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U. O U has always been known for their running game. More than, Right. F Oh, I tell you, they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless their little hearts <laughter>. Are they? I haven't been watching. D Well, good for us <laughter>. Oh. Yeah, they h, then he went out to S, to southern Cal. Is that where he went? Yeah. D So,
