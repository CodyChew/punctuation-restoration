think about this? I do. F Uh. C So you see a big difference then in before and now do you C or, A lot of testing? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I do too, I, F oh, I think that's awful. I know. What's the new criteria, F huh. We have all kinds of testing C and it's over and over. It's I T B S C or, and, F uh, just everything, everything. C And they test, test, test. I live in Plano actually C and I don't know if you've heard of Plano C but it's a very transient community. A lot of people from everywhere, it's just north of Dallas C and it's grown in leaps and bounds. I, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now. C And most of them from other places. F Uh, J C Penney's come down from New York and, of course, T I and Xerox from Rochester C and we just, have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in, C and it's a very wealthy community. F Uh, not that I am C but other people seem, to be C and I would love to know why C but E I mean they do. They have, I, I would, I really would. E I mean, they just have beautiful, beautiful homes C and they have everything. The kids only wear name brand things to school C and it's one of these things, D Well it does, D you know. It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now C and F uh, D you know, it does. E I mean, we do it to a point C but F uh, not to where she feels different, C but some of them are very rich C and so, F uh, we just kind of have, everything here C and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are. C And so I don't know how much of it, is us and how much of it is Texas C but the kids are expected to excel in, everything. C And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first C and they're expected to be. D You know, their parents expect it, the teachers expect it, Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system C and if you read national surveys, they're far from it. C And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests. D Well, not very well. They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before, tests. E I mean they make a big deal. To me, the paper should just be put on the desk that day C and say just do this. D You know, I just feel they do better that way. C And, Yeah. C And, C and I have older children too that now are out of high school C and they've always done this here. E I mean it's always been the same C but it is, it's getting worse and worse, is more pressure for everything. C And I just think it's really awful C and I, I'm with you on that. You don't hear too many people say this, C but I think it's a very long day. C And my feeling is that, D you know, you're only a kid once, C and you don't want to spend your whole life in school. Uhhuh, uhhuh. C And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. <Ringing> I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, <talking> piano. I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have wellrounded kids not just book smart kids. C And so I just find this a real problem. I think if they're going to be there all day, they should find time. One of my daughters, once, was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was. C And she had a <noise> home teacher for like four hours a week C and when she went back in six weeks, she was ahead. C So what does that tell you? It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time. C And they could be using this time better. <Talking> Uhhuh. That's a very long day for kindergartners. C But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this. D You know, C because they don't, they don't want to send them to daycare. That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day <ringing>. <Ringing>. We have them at one school D like, F Uh, do you have children in school? F Uh, I have two that are, F uh, now just about ready to graduate from college C but I also have two that are just entering school. F Uh, F Uh, D well I think they're just pushing them mu, entirely to fast. F Uh, D well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade. My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock. C And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner. C And, F uh, I have a preschooler. F Uh, I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten C and I thought D well how mature do you have to be <laughter>. C And, F uh, there is a, do you have the standardized testing now? Yeah. No. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. <Noise>. Yeah. <Noise>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> you would like to know what they're doing right <laughter>. F Oh me. D Well that makes it hard for you, doesn't it. F Oh, me. <Noise>. Yeah. It's hard to explain to them why you can't. <Noise>. Right. <Noise>. <Noise>. F Oh, dear. Right. Right <noise>. How about the kids. How are they coping with it? D Huh. <Noise>. Right. Yeah. Rather than anticipating. F Oh, it is. That's right. My son said that, came home C and he said, he said Mom, all we do is work. We hardly ever play C and, F Oh, likewise. Right. Wouldn't that be great. Uhhuh. Right. Is that right? F Oh, my gosh. F Oh, my gosh. D Well, for example, in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time. After lunch, they have some, F uh, I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch, C and then they have naps or rest period. C And, F uh, I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting. I agree. I wouldn't be surprised. I doubt if they would say it was too long <laughter>. F Uh, do you have the before school care, at your school and the after school care?
