not be a very good conversationalist on fishing. I don't do a lot of it. D Well good, maybe I can learn something. <Laughter>. Do you? D Well, it is fun, what little I do. Of course, I don't, D you know, I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, D well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm <laughter>. He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about <laughter>. <Laughter>. That's about the only kind I know how to do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it. Uhhuh. Do you have a boat? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas. The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock C but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes, D you know. Is it? Uhhuh. My inlaws live on a lake, F uh, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods, C and the lake is beautiful, C and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish, C but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there. I catch a lot of little old, F uh, I think they call them perch C and then the, the, F uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait <laughter>. C So it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit C but it's kind of fun. F Um I would be afraid of that. Do they ever get on your hook? Uhhuh. Are they poisonous snakes? Uhhuh. Yeah, I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those. Uhhuh. We, F uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my inlaws' place last year. It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that D you know. Great big snake, C and it, of course, it scared the women to death, D you know, C but the men come out and said F oh, D well, that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you, D you know. C But it looked so bad C and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us, C but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, D you know <laughter>. C But they're scary looking. Yes, F uh, I think that, F uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else. Uhhuh. D Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments. Uhhuh. F Oh, no. Uhhuh. D Well that's kind of, we've never entered a tournament or anything. We're not that big into fishing, C but I see a lot of people, D you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out, C and they'll say, D Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend, C and all those people are here for the tournament, D you know. C So I think there's a lot of people that have, D you know, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing, they're really into it to try to win. My. C But it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around. The peace and calmness is really relaxing. Uhhuh. I've never tried taking a book with me. I'll have to try that one of these days. D Well, I do love to fish. D Well, I don't know how much you can learn. <Laughter> I'm not so sure I'm good at it, C but I do enjoy doing it. Yeah. D Well, I hope it is, there's not a whole lot of different kinds. I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing, I, C because I get seasick, C but we have a lot of lakes here in this area C and I do a lot of fishing for, F uh, bass. We have a lot of, F uh, F uh, couple of lakes in our area that are fil, just filled with good sized bass. C And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish C and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows, C and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms. It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day. I do. F Uh, there's a lake D like maybe two or three miles from here, C and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think. Fishing's a good way to do that, C and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing. No, I don't. I have a friend who has a little infla, inflatable raft, C and we use that sometimes. I wish I had a boat, C but I don't. Uhhuh. Right. That's the same way here, isn't it? You have to get back in the sticks in the, Right. <Laughter> Oh. We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles, C but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes. C And I, D Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them. No, we, F uh, occasionally I'll catch an eel on a, on a hook, but never the snakes. They just kind of, F Uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth, C so yes they are, definitely C and they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in, C so I seem them swimming by every once in a while. Yeah, they can, they're, they're certainly ugly. Yeah. Definitely. Do you have bass? Right. D Well, that's pretty much the same way here. I, D Well, we have those. I don't I inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing. I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it. F Oh, yes. Yeah, F oh, definitely. Certainly here they are. Yeah, it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish. That's what I do a lot.
