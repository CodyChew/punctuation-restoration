Okay. I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so <laughter>. F Oh yeah. Right. D Well, Really? Why? Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you, Uhhuh. Right. D Well, it depends on where you're from in Texas. I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned <laughter>. That's how it is. It's divided, yeah. It really is, C so we've got our Cowboys here C and C and, F uh, I don't think anybody roots differently C but I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno C and he is for the L, the, F uh, Raiders. L A Raiders, C so. D Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well <laughter>, C but <laughter> I've been trying more this year. I think I know a little more than I use to. I never knew very much at all C so I'm trying <laughter>. <Swallowing> Yeah. C So I shouldn't even try to do it, F huh <laughter>? Yes. Right. Yeah. Really. I don't even think we have that in Texas. We might. Do we? <Talking> E I mean, no <laughter>, you probably know, I don't know. Nobody talks about it C so I don't think we do. No, uhhuh. C And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. We don't even have that very much, C so. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. F Oh yeah. Yeah. D Well, I like to do, I don't like to watch. I don't like to watch anything. C So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. I think it's an, excuse to do nothing C and I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding C and the guys get together C and that's kind of cool. That's fun, D you know. C But it can get really overdone. Yeah, I have. Yeah, yeah, I have. F Uh, <sigh> no D actually, no. I've done that for college football. Yeah. Yeah. Right. C And that's the thing, D you know. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, that's right. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, in high school I went to every football game C and, D well, I twirled, D you know. C And I, D you know, I didn't, I still don't know that much about football, obviously. C But I still had a good time. D You know, F Oh C so, D Well, it, let's put it this way. We've got the New England Patriots up here C so. They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. Yeah. F Um, D well, F uh, partly due to ownership. D You know, F uh, Victor Kiam owned the, F uh, the Patriots F uh, for a period of a number of years C and he always had this, F uh, this wonderful quality of c, being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something <talking> C and, F uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. C And it recently was sold <talking> to, F uh, some other people C so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, F uh, keep, F uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways <talking>. F Oh, yeah. I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before. Now you, you're, you're from Texas. C So you've got two football teams down there. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. There's that type of segregation, F huh? Wow! Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing> Do you, Uhhuh. Do you follow professional sports at all? <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, it's a good past time, D you know. Particularly football. They say, F uh, i, football attracts more men because of the, D you know, y, the, D you see the, the physical aggression on the field C and supposedly, psychologists say that, F uh, that, F uh, men take out their frustrations by watching football C and, D you know, they get together with a bunch of guys C and they, F uh, F uh, C and they have a good time and everything C and that's suppose to be some of the, F uh, the male bonding and the, and the, F uh, the male instincts, I guess, or something about the, F uh, D Well, no. It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, F uh, of a contest. I think that, F uh, I personally like hockey better because it has contact, it's a contact sport. It has the speed. And the hand eye coordination C and it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. C So we, C and that's, we're a big hockey area up here, I bet up here in New England as well as, D you know, in, in the Minnesota area C but, What, hockey? <Laughter>. No, there's no hockey, there's no <throat_clearing>. There's no professional hockey teams in, in Texas <throat_clearing>. Yeah. I think though that professional football in particular, is becoming so diluted now. D Like they have this World Football League. You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams <throat_clearing>. There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League <breathing> C but, F uh, now they have what's called the World Football League C and they have all these teams from, there's a team in London C and there's a team <throat_clearing> there, there's, F uh, teams, other European teams C and there's teams in the United States C an, C and they're playing now during the summer months C and it's really <door> D you know, overkill <swallowing>. C And there's only so much football you can watch. Yeah, that's good. <Noise> <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Now, have you ever been to a professional football game? Have you? Did you do the whole big, th, the whole thing, the tailgate party and the whole, D Well D see, D now D see that's what you got to do, D see. D Now we talked our, Yeah, yeah. You, the, D well the same thing. We, we talked our wives, there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. C And, F uh, we talked our wives into going with us one time C and they had a real good time C and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere. You go, D you know three or four hours before the game. You go set up. We set a table up, we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more. C But, C but that whole, it, it's not so much, D sure the contest itself and the game itself, but it's the whole atmosphere of playing, F uh, of going to a game. I, that you miss sitting home in your parlor, D you know, F uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, F uh, potato chips, D you know you, you miss that. C And, C and any professional sport I think, you miss that. The atmosphere of being there, D you know. <Laughter>. Yep. Well foot,
