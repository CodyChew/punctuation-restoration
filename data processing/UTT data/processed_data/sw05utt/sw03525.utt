They tell you what our topic was? Right. <Laughter> How much of a golfer are you? You bet. I'm fifty years old, I've been a hacker, I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than I play right now. C And, F uh, F Oh, I know, it's just unreal. I, D you know, I'm a guy that plays, if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year C and that's <laughter> about it. I figure that's my retirement game. I really, I come from a family of golfers. E I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, E I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, E I mean, further than most people could hit it. C And my mother who is now, A he's, my stepfather is dead, C but my mother who is now seventyone <breathing>, I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap, C but, C but, F uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every, they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, F uh, play nine holes of golf. That was their deal, they, C But, F uh I just, I just never could do it. I have a brotherinlaw who is, F uh, an excollege coach and like a pro C and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf <laughter> sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family. F Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm probably the same way. Lessons do help. I know ever year we buy, I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner, it's a hunter's type affair C and I buy in, in Austin, Texas, I go down to Austin, I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine C and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country. D You know, at, F uh, Horseshoe Bay. C And we just have a ball, C and we play three days in a row, three different courses C and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, F uh, third course, my score has gone from, D you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five. C So, You bet, C so it, that makes a lot of difference to me. You bet. Yeah. That's super. I haven't learned to hit the ball easy C and I just sort of, I'm always wanting to hit it hard C and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, D you know, just to relax and hit the ball, C and, D you know, D so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, D you know, a lot of my energy's gone, when I do swing it's an easier swing C and I do, actually, hit the ball better. No, I have a <breathing> two through, D you know, two through wedge. I hit a two iron awful lot. Off, now, off the tee. I don't hit a driver off the tee. That, that's why I need my driving lessons. That helps. D Well, that's, that's a good idea. I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more C and I'm going to do the same thing. I, I laid off my woods about three years ago C and I just use a two wood off the fairway C and I'm a fairly strong person C so I get a pretty good little drive C and I, and I guess control my irons, better, D you know, if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron. C And, F uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son C so, C but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play. Right. Makes good, makes good sense. F Oh, yeah. You bet. My cha, my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be <laughter>, great after that <laughter>. That, boy, I just, if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, D you know, D you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, D you know <laughter>. <Laughter> Because, I think golf, isn't it? <Laughter>. Are you a hacker? <Laughter>. I know I, F Oh, I know I did, I know I did. Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, D you know, C and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body. Uhhuh. Sure. <Breathing>. Yeah. That's what it takes, you, you need to play that often to get a really good handicap. D Well, I went to, I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more C and I, I went after it C and did, C and I really didn't find much improvement. Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would go, go back up, yeah, I, I think I need to, F uh, I probably need to take some, some more lessons, F uh, more current and, F uh, and practice more often. Spend more time on the, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with it. F Oh, yeah, if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference. Yeah, yeah, I, D well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly C and when I am doing that, F uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better, I, I, I get through the ball better. F Uh, C and I also, if I, I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance. C And I, my control is a little bit better there. F Uh, C so, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron? Uhhuh. D Well, D you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too, C and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver. F Uh, I had a lot more control on it, F uh, I sacrificed distance, C but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, D well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more. If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice g, F uh, range. F Uh, I think there is less flus, frustration factor there, too, F uh, C So, C but I, I, the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start. Apparently they're very difficult to play with, C but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too. C And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron, it's incredible. C And, C but, C and his accuracy is what's so startling with it. C And I, C and it, C but it's an iron that he's really practiced with. He has used a lot, C and, F uh, it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron. F Uh, distance iron. <Laughter>. C And get away without embarrassing yourself, right <laughter>.
