D So, how is the weather out there? F Oh, really? F Um. F Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same. The usual, I think. D So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff <laughter>. It's good. F Oh, really? What part? F Oh, really? Okay. It's more humid in Utah than there? Or there? Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah, D see, that's how it is in Texas, too C because when it's cold, it's really cold. C So, What's that? Right. Yeah. C So the humidity is I think what does it <laughter>. C Because I, I noticed when I got here, too, C because D like I'd, when it would snow in Texas F uh, I would just, E I mean we'd be f, really cold C and we'd have to get really warm, C and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing C and you don't you don't feel super cold. It was weird. C But, C so how long ago <baby> did you graduate? C Or did you, C or, F Oh, really? Oh. C So you just barely moved away? Do you like it out there? You do? Yeah. Uhhuh. C So you just moved away a year ago? Wow, really recent. F Oh, warm <laughter>. F Oh, man, it's got to be D like, it's probably fifty, fiftyfive, maybe. Maybe not that warm. Probably about, F uh, yeah. It's not, it's not that cold, really. Yeah. Yeah, that's a big deal in Texas, too. F Um. Yeah, that's true. That makes a big difference. F Huh. C So, did you used to ski when you were out here? Did you used to ski when you were in Utah? F Oh, really? <Laughter>. F Uh, not tons, C but I like to when I get a chance. I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then. Just saving my money for Christmas things and that. F Uh, no, this is actually my third year. Uhhuh. Yep. No, at B Y U. Yeah. D So, C but, I'll be here a long time <laughter>, at this rate. F Uh, it was nursing, C but I'm in the process of changing it right now. C Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U. You have to have D like a <laughter> three seven to get in C so, It's really, I'm going to look into some other fields. I'd like, all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much C so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school C so, Did you graduate in a certain field C or, In, Really? That what my sister did. Yeah, you might know her. Here name is Lori, Bird. Maybe not <laughter>. I think she graduated around then, too, though, eightyseven probably, C but, she got her doc, Yeah, yeah. C Because they, since, F uh, stopped that program. E I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily. E I mean, it's, it's really, F Uh, it's really cold C and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold C and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. How about you guys? Oh. Yeah, D well the weather, let's see, D well, the snow here is different from Utah's, C because I have lived in Utah for D like ten years. C And, F uh, Provo. I was going to B Y U. Yeah. C And, F uh, the snow is D like, really cold. E I mean, it's, D like, really humid C so it seems wetter or something like that. It's, Uhhuh. It's more humid in Iowa than Utah. Yeah. C And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold, C but I think Iowa is a lot colder <laughter> <noise>. Yeah, I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind <laughter>. I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. Yeah, I think that's true. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah. F Uh, I graduated in nineteen eightyseven. Yeah, my husband got his doctorate at B Y U, C so that's, C and so he just graduated this past year. Uhhuh <laughter>. Yeah, we really miss, D Well, we really miss Utah <laughter>. We miss the mountains. C Because it's, D like, really flat here <laughter>. D Well, not flat, but hilly. But no big mountains or anything. F Uh, in August. <Breathing> Yeah. C But, F uh, D see, D see what else can I say about the weather. F Uh, <lipsmack>, D well, today was warmer <laughter>. It was D like fortyfive <laughter>. C So, what's the temperature up today over there? F Oh, really? C And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill. C But they talk about wind chill here all the time. They said it could be, D like, six degrees out and, D like, negative fortyone wind chill. C So, that's what we're not used to <laughter>. C So, F oh, I, What's that? F Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once. I only skied once my whole life <laughter>. C But, do you do a lot of skiing there? Uhhuh. Yeah. C So is this your first year in Utah? C And you're going to school there? Oh. At U of U, C or, F Oh, really? Oh. What's your major? Uhhuh, oh. Yeah. That's true. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's, that's a good idea. F Uh, education. I got a double major. F Uh, elementary and special ed. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Yeah, D well, I can't, there are so many girls in all my classes, I <laughter> can't remember how many people. F Oh, have they? Oh.
