<Clicking> <talking>. D Well, actually, I love the car I have. I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible. C And I love it. C And I would get another one in a minute. Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, D you know, a little Corvette or something like that. C And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car. C And I'd love an expensive one C but I probably, can never afford it C so <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I'm a nurse here C and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari. C And I couldn't tell you C but it's just beautiful. C And I go out and I love to touch it C but I can't even do that because <laughter> of the alarm. C So, I just look at it a lot <laughter>. Really <laughter>. Exactly. C But it sure is a pretty thing <laughter>. No. I'm working on it <laughter>. No, I really haven't, no, huhuh <talking>. I did test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before. It was brand new, white, it was like a big marshmallow. When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you. E I mean they came in and up and out C and E I mean, they did whatever C and, C and we went for a test drive in that C and I was able to open that up pretty good C and that was really fun. C And I wanted it, C but I had a choice of that or my house C and I thought that I'd continue, to live in my house <laughter> C so. Yeah, D you know, it's just necessary. C And I did, I thought D well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical. Yeah, right <laughter>. C So, They are, they're pretty aren't they lately <noise>. They really are. <Baby_crying>. Really. F Oh, no <laughter>. No, no. D See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now C and <noise> they go isn't that a nice van C and I go, um. <Laughter> Not really, D you know. How about a Greyhound bus <laughter>. Yeah. E I mean that, D you know. There's some that are prettier than others C and yeah, the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like C but I sure don't think it's attractive, D you know. It's not like, like driving a little sports car. Yeah. I don't think that happens C so, C but I, I love mine, C so, C and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii C and I just went home C and I walked in C and I picked it out C and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to, C and I never did. I just went back and signed the papers <laughter> C and I knew nothing about my car when I got it. Nothing. I didn't know how anything worked. Yeah. C And I've had it, it's almost three years actually. C And I've, I still love it. I put the top down everywhere I go. I timed it when I first got it C and it took twenty min, E I mean twenty seconds C and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds. C So. Twenty seconds, yeah. That's all it takes. E I mean, it's just a button, that's it. You release it right <noise> at the top, C so you don't have to get out or anything. D Well I did, actually. Last week going to the airport, I just hit a downpour C and I was on a highway going like eighty. C So I really did. E I mean <laughter> I was soaking wet. I thought I would drown <laughter> in the seconds that it took me to pull over <laughter>. C But it all dried out, D you know. Didn't take long when the sun came out C but <laughter> <sniffing> it was kind of funny. I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it <laughter> C but, Oh F C and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything, yeah, yeah. <Noise> <<someone is walking>> Yeah. A lot of people say that C and it's pretty far from where I live <talking>. D So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next? Ah. <Laughter>. F Uh, D well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles. F Uh, I currently have an eightyseven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, F uh, handle and perform better, C and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, F uh, the best car I could get regardless of money, <inhaling> F uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari. A, a three twentyeight G T S? <Laughter> You just go hunting? Go out and lust after it. D So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari? . F uh. <Laughter>. Yeah, there, there's something about having a place to live, I don't know. Could sleep in the back of the 'vette. I find that, F uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars. Yeah. C And they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive. It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something. <Laughter>. Nice. Yeah. Nice isn't the word I'd choose. Maybe practical. Isn't that a practical van. Yeah. It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive. D Well, C so it was a completely new experience for you. C And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it. Right. C And, C and you couldn't get, how long does it take to go back up? About the same time. Yeah, C so <noise>. C So you won't get, Yeah C and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial. <Laughter>. Whoops. Yeah. <Laughter> F Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week C and the weather was pretty nice too. C So, With the Bluebonnets out, yeah. It really was. Yeah I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
