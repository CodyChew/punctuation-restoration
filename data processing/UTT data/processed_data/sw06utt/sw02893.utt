D So. Yeah, I sure do. F Uh, I ride a bicycle quite a bit and F uh, work out with free weights <breathing>. I live right near White Rock Lake, C so I used to, I try to ride, about ten to twenty miles a day. C But, I haven't been doing so well this year, <breathing> C but, F Oh that's weird. F Oh, yeah. D So what's your motivation? Yeah. Was it for health, or, to look good? I was think, It was just a side benefit. Yeah. Up to a point. Yeah. Yeah, D so what was, what was the other question, let's see, do you do it as a task C or do you enjoy, enjoy working out. Yeah, I think I, F uh, I enjoy it sometimes C and there's other times when I just get tired of it C and, C and I feel like I'm obligated to do it, because I've been doing it C so I should keep up. C And there's some days it's just D like it's the hardest thing in the world to, to get started. I'm, F uh, twentyseven. Yeah, still young, getting older. Yeah, C but, F uh, <Meow> Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, I notice if you, F uh, if you stay in shape you don't age as bad, I think, too. I was, I go to school, too, at night C and last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot, C and you just, those kind of things age you more. Right, C an right C an you can't, C and then, D you know, it just kind of feeds itself. You smoke, C and then you don't work out because you, Right, C and so, I finally quit because, D like I just, all I was doing was going down hill fast. <Meow> Yeah. Right back to them. Yeah. F Oh that's, Yeah, yeah. I went to health club a few years ago, C and now I work out at home, because I don't really, my schedule with school and work, I don't have time to get down to one. There used to be one that was a twentyfour hour that I used to go to C but, F uh, I actually prefer to work out alone. Really. Yeah. I wouldn't mind having, D you know, working out with a friend and, and stuff C but when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait. D You know, I like to start, get it done and get out of there. No, I'm not. Yeah. Right. F Uh, especially having a kid, I guess, tends to just gain weight because you have to, to, to, F uh, Just have to start all over. Right. Yeah, some people are a little bit fanatical about it. D You know, I, D Well yeah, and about, working out and fitness, D you know, I like to, to work out to look good and stay in shape C and, D you know, I know it's good for me, C but people that live for it and, D you know, eat a bunch of different pills, and, all that kind of stuff, it gets a little bit obsessive. Yeah. Yeah. Steroids. Yeah, there's really bad for you. Hem, hormones. Yeah, it's too dangerous. <Laughter>. Yeah, I had a friend whose brother did steroids C and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out. It all turned to fat C and he just, really looked bad. C But, F uh, I don't know if it does to everybody, he was, i, it, just that's how it affected him. C And he, I don't know, just, Yeah. At least you got a chance to out run them that way. I don't like to run myself. I've thought about it several times C and I just, it, I like to move a little faster and cover more ground. It's probably, I would think it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff. Yeah. F Uh, I can't. Yeah. No, you can't, it's dangerous. At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires, you slide all over the place. Yeah. Yeah, D well. D Well good luck with the, the new kid. All right. Okay, do you rec, exercise regularly. What do you do? Okay, I love to ride a bicycle. F Oh, that's good. I went an, last year I went an was exercising on a bike for a while C and I, when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day, the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel. It was the sweating, not the burn that was wild <child_talking>. C But, I exercise, I don't exercise now, I just had a baby three months ago, I haven't really gotten back into exercising. C But I exercised real good for a couple of years. It was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week C and it was running three nights a week. What, what's my motivation? A friend of mine, always pushing me. This was in Louisiana. C And she would push, D you know, she was, hey, let's go do it, C and D you know, she wouldn't take no for an answer <child_talking>. F Oh, I ju, I just wanted to look good, yeah, it wasn't really health related. Yeah, yeah, C because I'm not, I'm not big or anything, C but I'm not in great shape, C so. C But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. I don't think women look good with muscles. Up to a point, no, m, yeah, <laughter>. It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it. I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately. Yeah. <Laughter> You don't want to lose yourself. D Well how old are you? Okay, C so you're still young. We all are, D so. It's not hard to stay, D well if you keep working out when you're young though, when you get older, D you know, your body's not going to look as bad. I seen an old woman today, she was about eighty C and she looked so good, E I mean she was standing just as straight and tall C and she had a small waist C and she didn't have, D you know, D like, you know, how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle. A, she didn't have that at all. She, her lips were a little bit wide, C but a lot of, back in her time, they liked women with big hips anyway C so she may be keeping that on purpose, C so <laughter>. Uhhuh <noise>. D Well smoking ages you quick, it puts those little wrinkles around your lips. You get winded. F Oh, I smoke a pack a day C an, I can't quit smoking, I've tried. I was telling a friend of mine that I'd be almo, almost as bad as being an alcoholic, I can't quit smoking. I've tried, I just can't do it. I quit when I was pregnant with my kids, C but, D you know, as soon as I had them, right back to it. Yeah. It was like, D you know, that was the only reason I quit. I didn't want to. C And I don't want to quit smoking, I enjoy that. I said I have very few vices, I'll keep this one thank you <laughter>. C But, F uh, did you ever go to D like one of those health clubs or anything? Uhhuh. I like to work out with people, I need, D like you, I, I need competition, is what I need. I've got to have somebody to compete with, C or I don't want to do anything. Uhhuh, are you, Uhhuh, are you married or anything? No, D well, get your girlfriend to work out with you. A lot of women like that. I'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him. He doesn't work out very often. Course, he don't need to. He's small C and he works as a laborer on the railroad. C So, D you know, he's building his muscles up all day, he doesn't have to do anything. He can eat like a horse, too. C And he don't, D you know, he don't gain it like I do. C But, F uh, Yeah, you have to. D Well you can gain too much weight. I gained a little bit too much, C but I looked, with my first little boy, I did gain a lot of weight, I got, I got about fifty pounds overweight with him C and I didn't loose it until two years ago C and then I got pregnant and, D you know, ruined that, C so <laughter>. Yeah, D well, D actually, like I say, it ain't as bad this time, because I was in shape when I got pregnant. I wasn't out of sha, I wasn't overweight when I got pregnant with him, I just wasn't in, in shape. I don't know the difference C but, About weight? Exercise. D Well that's what my friend did. D Well, she was, she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else C and really, we was, D you know, even with her taking all those e, expensive vitamins and stuff, we stayed right on the same track with each other, D you know, developing and everything. Now there, you can take those, F uh, what is it? Steroids, yeah, I couldn't think, I was goin, I was trying to say hemorrhoids, <laughter>, no, I was trying to say hem, hormones. Yeah, hormones, C but yeah, F uh, steroids. C But, I stay from that crap. F Oh, I wouldn't, <laughter> I could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something. <Laughter>. Really. Ugh. I didn't know it did that. Yeah, C but I've been wanting to get me a bicycle, E or a bike. I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around. I'm scared to run, for dogs. Course I know dogs can get you on a bike too, C but, seems like it, Yeah <laughter>. D Well they, yeah, they've come up that <throat_clearing> running is not as good for you as they thought it was. Yeah, it's real hard on your legs C and it's hard on women. C And it, it just makes stuff move down. C And, F uh, C but I, I, I like jogging, I don't mind that. I can get out and do that, as long as it's not hot. If it's hot, you can't do that. C But in the rain, F oh, I love to run in the rain, just, D you know, be careful not to slide. C But you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you. You slide. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I, when I did ride my friends bike, that one time, I had, F uh, I don't know what I was trying to do. I was trying to make a U turn C and I never could make a U turn in a bike, I can do it in my car, C but I tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked C and I told her a dog was chasing me <laughter>. C But I wrecked it into the curb. I didn't hurt it too bad. I scratched it on the, the F oh, she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, I think. C But F oh D well. D Anyway, it's been nice talking to you. C And, F uh, <Laughter> Thank you, <laughter> she's, it, she's good. D Anyway, have fun exercising. All right, byebye.
