F Uh, D well, I guess social change takes in a, a big category, C but, F uh, I guess the, the one aspect of it that I took in, F uh, consideration is more economical. I, I know that the amount of, E or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has, has greatly changed. I know, they, they did a, it was on a talk show, they took, F uh, the parents and then the, F uh, the son, C and they compared income at different points in time when the, when the father was, D you know, was a little bit younger and more in his heyday and they, and they compared to the son's, that he was making now. C And even though the son was probably more successful, D you know, higher up in the, the management ladder F uh, his, he was actually making less money when you co, when you go by costs of living. Yeah. I know just, F uh, just with me, ten years ago, I was comparing the, I think I, I was living better ten years ago than I am now, even though I'm making more money now, C but my dollar went a lot farther. Yeah. Yeah, D well, I, I know gas prices have definitely jumped, F uh, from, F uh, I know I used to pay twentyfive cents a gallon C and now it's over a buck. I don't know what it's, F uh, by you. Around here Minnesota, Wisconsin area it's, F uh, it's dropping, C but I think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average. Okay. D Well that's, F uh, that's unu, most of the people I talk to are Texas, C so. Yeah. Oh. I suppose this will be one of my, towards my last one pretty soon, C so they'll stop me C but, F uh, I'm, F uh, I'm pretty much out to the things to say. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I, I, I don't think they, they consider, like I say, it's a broad category, it's just I'm not economical C but F uh, even attitudes on, on clothing and stuff, F uh, I know. Yeah, I, I, I know a lot of the things that, that we wear, men wear nowadays were, would have been considered, F uh, feminine, F uh, many years ago, C but. I know, it's been, it was hard for me at first, C but now I kind of like, D you know, a lot of the bright colors. E I mean, D like I used to be more, F uh, conservative and just your basic colors, C but now I, I do like some of these, F uh, brighter, fluorescent colors. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I guess the, the best thing I like to see from the sixties and seventies is, of course, is the mini skirt, of course <laughter>. One of the nice things, C but, F uh, yeah, I don't think that there's anything as original, it's, it's all based on, F uh, one of the past styles, they just, F um, make their, F uh, circle and come back again. C So if you hang onto your clothes long enough, F uh they'll, they'll be back in style in a few years <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I think, thinking back, I think the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms. I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say God. F Um. Yes, I agree. Uhhuh. Right. F Um. Right, uhhuh. C And it's depending on where you live, though, too. Yeah. That's true. Ten years ago I was eleven <laughter>. F Oh. I remember though, D like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now. And gas, C and I used to hear stories from my Grandpa, C and, D you know, he could see a movie for D like a nickel and things like that. Yeah. Yeah, I'm from Wisconsin, yeah,. F Oh, yeah, I spoke to a person from Texas, too. This is only my second phone call C so I'm <laughter> waiting for mine. F Um. F Oh, like, like social changes. F Um, F um, C and I don't think this would have anything to do with it, C but D like clothing and styles, lot of those changed. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh, definitely. Towards each other. Uhhuh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, C but they, styles come and go all the time, though. It's just ridiculous, fads in and out. C And even, F um, clothing from the sixties came back. I see a lot of, F um, girls wearing sixties clothes. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. That's true, <laughter> maybe some day I probably won't be alive to see it, C but prices might go down lot more. I don't know though, doesn't look good. <Laughter> Yeah, I remember that, <laughter> I do <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah, I didn't really care for them either <laughter>. C But now I,
