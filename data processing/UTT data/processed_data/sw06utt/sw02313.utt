D Well, how many credit cards do you have? Sounds like we have no conflict. We had, for a while I was carrying one card C and my wife was carrying a different one. C And since the slips all look alike, F uh, you commingle them C and then you get the statement C and you try to sort them out, F uh, C and it, F uh, <laughter> it caused more confusion about it. I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time. C And then when A T and T came along and offered a free one, F uh, I accepted that, C and we've been using that one. F Uh, the interesting thing is, is that, F uh, the amount of money you can can run up on them. I don't know, do you know any people that run up big, big bills? D Well, did, F um, were you able to get one while you're in college? Just curious, because I have a son that's a senior this year, C and he's heading off, with any kind of luck, C but there has been, I've had a couple of ads for, for, for to provide a card for a college student. F Uh, what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that? D Well, that, that, that, I guess from the, from the card issuer, F uh, that since, since it's, it's in, mo, the parent gets it for them, that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible, C but it's, Yes, it's whether the parent wants to take the risk. Yeah, to, to go run up a big bill C and, the thing is, there some advantages, if he got off some place and stranded. I, I'm, I'm leaning towards doing it for, for conven, a convenience, Yeah, C and the idea that, D you know, if he got in trouble, there's some, some ways of getting out, and that he doesn't have to carry cash. The, F uh, I, I like the idea of credit cards that, F uh, I don't, I don't, I don't carry cash around, and, and, F uh, I don't even carry checks around. I let my wife take the checkbook, C and she writes the checks, C and I record them. D So it's, F uh, it's, F uh, it's, C but it's interesting that, F uh, the people that can, that can, F uh, the amounts of money you can run up wi, on, on credit cards, C and, F uh, I, I had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up, he was making, F oh, considered a modest salary for an engineer, C and he had run up, F uh, more than a years salary in, in various debts to, C and he wound up declaring bankruptcy C but there, it, it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty, thirty thousand dollars of, F uh, D well, it was a combination of things he had, there were, there were several credit cards, C and then there were several other businesses, C but, F uh. I, I guess what's interesting, have you seen the, the, the, the ads where they're offering to extend payments from, F uh, things like, F uh, like the credit union's offering, Yes, yeah. The interesting thing about that is, is that, F uh, that, that they're encouraging you to incur more, incur more debt, C and, C And they make more money if you extend your loan. Yes. C And they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service they're not going to keep on if the car were older. The interesting thing about it is is that from a, F uh, F uh, an economy standpoint E or in economics, I, I thinks it's, I think it's poor, poor, F uh, economics to, to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint, C so. It's interesting that, that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible, C and this year it's ten percent or so. It's, F uh, it's interesting that, that, F uh, they encourage us to do things, I think ten percent, yes. Of your, of your consumer credit. F Oh, if you had a thousand dollars, that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you. Yeah, it's on, F uh, yeah. Yeah, on the, the, there's, there's, there's a place for consumer debt C and then you take ten percent of it, on the, F Oh, okay, It's on schedule, F um, Schedule A under, F uh, D well, it's the same place, it's the same place you put, F uh, interest. C But, C but see that's what, that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that you can't, you can't take out a, a second mortgage, like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that, C and so, F uh, it's fully deductible. The laws are a little squirrelly, C but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint. C But, F uh, anyway, Sounds like you're, you're very respon, very financially responsible. It's, F uh, That's, F uh, there're a lot of people who really run, my boss drives quite a ways to work, C and he's got just enormous debts, C and he's, C but, E I mean, what do you say, it's D like, Shucks, <laughter> Boss, I'm sure sorry you've got all that debt. D Well, he's had, had two kids in college and, and this kind of thing, C and that I think that the whole credit card issue, I think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts C and, C but I agree with you I don't, I my debts. D Well, I did buy a new house last summer. It's, it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car, C and that, F uh, apparently that's been going on for a really long time. I didn't do it. I, I bought a second hand car when I was, the middle of my senior year. Yep. Miscellaneous things like food and other things, these habits you get into, eating C and, C and, F uh, it's, it's, it's amazing how it, what you learn. D Well, anything else good to say about credit cards? I might just, You don't have to carry the cash, C and, C and, F uh, C and it's, it's, it's certainly accepted more places than, the places, D you know, it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state, C and, Yeah. They don't allow, they don't do tha, Yeah. Carry all that cash with you. D Well, D you know they, they they've started towards a little bit of the debit card, have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you, Yeah, C and I think that's where, Yeah, I've seen a couple, although the, so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the, the time frame which they get paid, in general, that, F uh, they, I've seen checks deposited the very next day, E I mean, cleared my account the next day. My wife will write a check for groceries C and, D you know, almost, D well I guess it's the day after, F uh, technically it's two days, C but the, the, they took that check and scurried it to the bank C and the bank scurried it back to my account, C and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float, C but apparently that's why the, F uh, the, F uh, the, F uh, grocery stores are reluctant to do that, because their volume, that is quite high, C and they have, F uh, the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them. Anyway. D Well, it's good talking to you. Maybe we'll get across, we'll cross paths again. Good night. F Um, I've only, I've got about four maybe. I try to limit them because I, D well one, I don't use them too much. C And I use my Visa just for abou, for about everything, C and I pay it all off. C So I try not to, I just use it for free money for thirty days basically. I'm, I'm D you know, I'm in the age group you get out of college, C and I think a lot of these people have them maxed out. F Um, I don't think I ever tried. F Um, D well, <throat_clearing> yeah, I, I, D you know, it's, D you know, feasible, E I mean, I know a lot of college kids who have them, D you know, who had them, but just depends. Yeah, C so basically if you want to take the risk <laughter>. It's your risk, do you trust, your, your son, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I'd say, do, D you know, have one with, D you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something. Uhhuh. The, the extended loan payment for your car. Yeah. I saw that. D Well, it's, it's, it's business, C and they're making money off that. Yeah, C and, C and it's, C so it's business, C so, C and you notice that they're, they're only going to do it to D like cars that are one or two years old. C And so they've already shifted the risk. If they assume that car, then they just have to sell it themselves, C and they'll recover the loan, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, F uh. What, D now what's ten percent, we can deduct, I didn't know that. I didn't think you could, any thing on a loan E or, E I mean a mortgage I know you can, F Oh, I've never itemized yet. D So maybe that's. Schedule A or, Yeah. Yeah, I try, I, I really do, I just try to stay out of debt, C and I, C and I use my Visa for, for as much as I can, C and I pay it all off, C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Throat_clearing> Hell, I took a five year note out on my car when I, D right when I got out of college, C and, F uh, I'll never do that again. I still got a couple of years on it to go, C and I'm, D Well, you, you think you're starting out well, until you start paying all those bills. F Uh, apartment rent, C and, Yeah. Yeah, C so. F Um D you know, they're convenient, D you know, that's probably one big thing about them, C and, F uh, Yeah, D well, I was used to using my credit card, D like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas, and stuff C and now I'm out here in Phoenix. They, they, none of these grocery stores take any credit cards, C so now I have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store, which is new to me, D you know, I got to have sixty bucks on me or something. C So, F uh that was interesting, cause I always, D you know, you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless I knew I, Yeah, I've heard about them. That's mostly locally, the banks will line up with, F uh. Yeah. All righty. All righty. Take it easy.
