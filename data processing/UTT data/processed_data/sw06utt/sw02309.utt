Okay, have you ever served as a juror? Uhhuh. I never have either. D Well, I think it's a good idea. I think our justice system needs a major overhaul, C and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it. C But I think they've got a lot of problems. True. Yeah, I think that's true. <Laughter> Yeah. Do, would you prefer all trials by a judge? Yeah, I would agree with that. I think you're righ, I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking D well it's only going to cost the insurance company, C and, Uhhuh. If they give them all the information. I don't know, when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if a guy, if the person has a previous record and stuff. Sometimes it seems like during the trial part, the jury's not, D you know, misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave, C and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it. Right. Yeah. Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Some of them disagree, E I mean, some of them said one way and some the other. I think it does have to be unanimous. I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was, C but I thought that they all had to agree C or else they, it was a hung jury. C And, Yeah, I thi, I don't know how I feel about that. I think maybe, F uh, majority might be sufficient. It's hard to say though. Oh. Yeah, I hadn't thought about international trials at all. Right. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street for something like that because of the cultural differences. Things like that. Yeah. What about uniform sentencing? Right. Yeah, D like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years. It's not a discretionary thing. Uhhuh. Yeah. I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years. Yeah, I, Yeah, C and sometimes those people are, are young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble. Yeah, I don't believe that very often happens. I don't think so either. In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad. Yeah. I think, I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some, some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, D you know. Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, D you know, world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them, C and, Yeah. Yeah. Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I think that covers it. Nice talking to you. Bye. You, too. Bye. Never. I've never been served on the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors. You haven't, F huh. If you were, F uh, what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers? I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial. C And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or, or what, C but, F uh. Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined, C and they're too easily swayed by their emotion. Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES, T V shows. No, I think there are certain things that, F uh, the jury can determine as far as, F uh, guilty or not guilty, C but as far as the af, af, affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature, <throat_clearing> I don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de, to award, D you know. Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing, D you know, it's true that, D you know, this may be sad and all that thing, C but, F uh, the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination of guilt and innocence, but not the award of, of penalties and fines and punishment. Uhhuh, that's true. C But, F uh, I do like the idea of the jury being the, the people who decide in the matter of, F uh, if it's a jail term versus life and death D you know, the death penalty and such. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. F Uh, it, it, it's kind of difficult, C and I guess the whole system is set up to rather let, F uh, some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in, in jail although you still hear about those occasionally. F Um, I don't know. I, D you know, I heard a very interesting, C and maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching, they were going through a trial, C and I think it was D like on one of the, the documentary T V shows where they ask for the, the verdict by the jury C and they went by each one, saying guilty or innocent, guilty or innocent. C And they took it more as just D like a majority. D So I, I, Exactly, C but they took, D you know, whatever the majority was. C So I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is. I always thought it had to be unanimous. C But, F uh. Rather interesting. Uhhuh. I did, I did also. Uhhuh. What about in international trials. Do you think they should have a jury there? I think that would be kind of interesting. I guess the, the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like, D you know, the old day with the rack. We, they're going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars. D Well, whose going to really make them. Nobody. C So. C But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, D you know, people from different countries, F uh, in as international law also. Uhhuh. Right. I don't know how, what it would take to be, come up with a true perfect system, E or if one exists. C But, F Uh, is that the crime C and it's already, some chart and determine the punishment, C or. Uhhuh. I think there should be a core minimum that they get C but, F uh, I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature. C But, Yeah, that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, F uh, if you sentence someone to life, life is only fortynine years, something like that. C And I guess you're eligible after twentyseven for parole, even though you're in for life. Yeah, although I guess it's, you, you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time. No. C Because F uh, inside the jail there, I don't think there's no real rehabilitation. Yeah, it's another war zone. C But, who knows. I agree, get them out there, Sure, they should have them go out and doing stuff. Cleaning up, or picking up dirt, or weeds, or who knows what. Something for the, for the state, since the state is paying for them, they should get some kind of, kind of work out of them. Exactly. Trading their lives for cigarettes those kinds of things. D Well good. I think so. Nice talking to you also. Have a wonderful Easter. Bye.
