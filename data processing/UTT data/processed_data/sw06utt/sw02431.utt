F Oh, okay. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Sure, you ready? Okay. D Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to re, retire. C And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, D you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now. I do, I don't know, we're C either going to buy a pick up, C or we're going to buy a van. C Or we're going to buy an economy car, how do you like that <laughter>? F Uh, yeah. Yeah. It sure does. I really would like to have something like that, C and I'm hoping that by D you know, <breathing> that's like, right now, my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now. C But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features. D Well, just like that air bag. I think that thing is fantastic. C Because I've seen some of the, D you know, D like the head on collision type things, when they had it <breathing>, and people walk away from it. We had one here, I guess it was about three weeks ago, C and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. D You know, a few bruises. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You got it. I, I, tell you what, I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door. D Well, you know what the average person, would you ever have thought of that? E I mean now i, you probably wouldn't have, Right C because you always think, E I mean, I don't know, maybe you don't, C but <breathing> just like me, I always think D well, D you know, these things must be safe, C but that's just like, I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago, they said, <breathing> D you know, before they had the, D like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist? All these people were, C and, C and it, it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTYTWENTY these people were like paralyzed, <breathing> C and C because, it threw them forward, C but they were hooked at the waist, <breathing> C and so it D like, D you know, did something to their spinal cord then they were like paraplegics. Right. Yeah. D Well, tell me about your van. Do you like it? Uhhuh. F Huh. The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida C and, like I said, E I mean, we're not that old C but my husband works for the State, C and after a certain amount of years you can retire. C And when he retires I'm retiring. D Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period, that's it, D you know, no more <laughter>. As though Uhhuh <lipsmack>. C And we wanted to travel, D well, that was really nice traveling C but D you know, I like to know more, E I mean, hear about more people that have things like that D you know? C And see what they think of them, the different kinds C because I've only ridden in the one, that's it. F Uh, <lipsmack> shoot I can't even think of the name of it now. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, D now, this one that we went in, it did <<speaks to husband>> baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in? Ford. A what? Ford. A Ford? Ford what, you remember? <<ends conversation with husband>>. He was trying to think of what the name of it was, this was a big one. E I mean it was a big one, it has the front and the back C and D you know, it has the F uh, back seat let down into a double, E I mean a queen size bed C and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front C and, E I mean it was fantastic, C and it got good gas mileage, C but <breathing> I don't know I don't really, I don't, I want something I can drive too, D you know, C and I was scared to drive that big van. D Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where D you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, E I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things C and it would look like it was further back than it was. Yeah, does yours do that too? F Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that, Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, D see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them, at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it, C but then that gas mileage was just atrocious, E I mean it's, unreal, it's, it just practically don't get any. Yeah. C And then, F uh, he talked about a van, C and I said, D well, D you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these. C And another thing was that's the reason I said D you know, there was such a big difference D you know, in a little economy car, C but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere. C But really and truly the safety features C but I wouldn't get one that, if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it. Period. F Oh that would be good. F Oh I think so too, I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now. I'm C but I think you need the shoulder thing I think you need the thing around your waist, C but, I think you need that bag to pop out too. D You know, because <breathing> I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that air bag, they may still be walking around. C But, F uh, I think it's fantastic. I wish they required it in everything. Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it. Yeah. D Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, D you know, they would have to do it, the insurance company would have to do the same thing. <breathing> They're given like, a ten year time limit where, okay. These cars, A I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years C and then, D you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously, F Oh that's okay, Okay. D Well, you, you too. All right bye bye. F Uh, no I think that maybe the, the automation people that are very discrete. Or not discrete, electronic devices. C So, C and, did he, i, is he the one that got you connected with us? Okay. It's a lot of fun. <Lipsmack> You want to punch the button and go? Yip <beep>. D Well, are you going to buy a car soon? C And what are you going to buy? D Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, F uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones <breathing> that, that all have air bags? Does that make a difference to you? Yeah, like what? Yeah. That's. Di, did you see the, F uh, I don't know if it was TWENTYTWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts? Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over. <Breathing> that really sc, I, I guess, I, that, that a little more than scared me, that irritated me, F uh, that, because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open <laughter> the lady would fall out, E I mean, C and, <Breathing> F uh no, probably, D well, I might, the problem is I'm really into cars, C and so it's not a, F uh, for me it's, it's a real, it's a real consideration, F uh, F uh, C and, C and, F uh, the, <breathing> C but no I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars it's, it's probably my main hobby. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Breathing> Yeah. <Breathing> yeah, D you know, ROAD AND TRACK had a, had some articles on, C and particularly with, with back seat, F uh, with some, where kids, were, were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on, C and they were thrown forward, into the front seat, C and there was enough stretching, <breathing> the combination of stretching the spine to, F uh, par, E I mean, the serious injury, even though they were, they were still locked in the they were forced to go, C so really if your sitting in the back seat, your better off not not to have your seat belt on, if it's just a seat belt. We have a van, that, F uh, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness <Breathing> I have an Arrow Star van, we really do. F Uh, it's, it's a mini van, we've had it, goodness in May will be five years C and, F uh, they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty. C And the transmission was replaced C but they really are nifty, F uh, the mini van, it's actually, we had a station wagon before, C and it's a foot or two shorter than a, we had a regular size station wagon C and it really, F uh, we like it, it, the interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, C but, the, did you, did you go to Florida in a van? <Breathing> Yeah. Yeah. What, what kind was it? What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the, we have two kids, C and we went to Disney World F uh, actually I grew up in Alabama, C and I went to see my mother, C and then went on down to Disney World, C and it got better than, I think twentytwo, twentythree miles a gallon. C And this was with the air conditioner on and, and D you know four people with, with luggage, C and, F uh, course this, grant it, that's, D you know, it's been four years ago, C but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, F uh, they're, F uh, my boss just bought a, a pick up truck, C and, F uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon. C But it, it has a big engine, C and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff, C but it's, C and it, it's got the seats that, C and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, F uh, rear air conditioning. C And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates. D Well, the big, D you know, the big vans are all, real nice, yeah, F oh those are yeah. Yeah. All right. Uhhuh. D Well D well, the mini, that, you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, F uh, more or less alike the, the, F uh, Chevrolet C and, F uh, D well of course, Oldsmobile has got one, C and Chryslers got one, C but they drive remarkably like cars. Yeah. Yeah C but, the little, thing etched in it, say objects are, are closer than they appear or something <laughter>. Yeah. D Well you, you can, you can, F uh, install those mirrors, we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice. I don't know if you've, D well, if you've driven a pick up truck, D you know, these are, these, F uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high, C and they're really nice, F uh, got them on both sides, actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back. C But they're uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, D you know, with the aerodynamic features, you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Ford now announced I think in ninetytwo, they're going to put, F uh, air bags in their, in their vans. C So, F uh, C and I think, I, I believe safety, I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, F uh, C and I, I think it can go,, I'm not, the air bags are a good deal C but, F uh, surprisingly, F uh, they're, F uh, you really need to do, you need a combination of both the air bags and the, F uh, and the seat belts C so, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Breathing> It would be that would do to our insurance rates, D you know, if, if, F uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, D you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, F uh, air bags. Would be interesting wouldn't it? F Uh, that wouldn't be fair C but, F uh, Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh, F uh, I've got to go <laughter> my son's in a performance tonight, I have to leave, in a couple of minutes. F Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time. It was good talking to you, Okay. Good night.
