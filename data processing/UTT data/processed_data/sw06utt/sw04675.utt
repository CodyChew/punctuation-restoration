<Noise> Okay. Do you have a budget that you go on? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh <sniffing>. Uhhuh. D Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be. Each month they g, are more or less just about the same, D you know. F Uh, very seldom are they any different. C And then, F uh, D like for groceries and everything, we try to put, D like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can <laughter> in the kitchen <sniffing> C and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with. C And then we put our receipts in there, D you know, C and usually that's enough. C And, F uh, C but I don't have any, D you know, small children to have anything extra come up, D you know, like, F uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them. <Noise>. Yeah, yeah, right. In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day <laughter>. Yeah. Tha, that, it's worse than having a kid, F huh? Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh, I'm not working right now. I worked for P I E C and then, F uh, they went bankrupt C so I just went ahead and took my early pension. C But I only get that once a month. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. C So, Yeah. C So, D you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, D you know, each month. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. C And, F Oh, yeah. Right now it's terrible isn't it? <Noise> Yeah. Uhhuh. I also like longterm Christmas club be, D you know. I used to belong to a Christmas club, last year I didn't. Then, C so then, naturally, Christmas comes along C and that puts you behind too, D you know. C So this year, D now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club. C So I figure, D you know, that's going to help some. Yeah, right, <noise> D you know. Right, right. C And I'm ta, F Oh, that's good. I'm taking like, F uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can C so I won't have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore. I know. I even bought myself a Surgery, D you know, C and I just love it. I haven't learned everything to do on it yet C but I figure that will help me save D you know. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, D see, some people are, some aren't C because I have some sisters, I have three sisters C and <noise> none of those are really interested in sewing. <Noise>. Yeah, C and then I can also, D you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales. D So, which I've been doing. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Oh. D Well, have you called? Oh. F Oh, it is? F Oh, D well, that, that's nice <laughter> D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets. When I was working, I, F uh, bought a bond a month out of my, D you know, they automatically took it out of my out of my payroll. All rightie. Yeah. I sure do. F Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet C and I just write down e, all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay C and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week. F Uh, E I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, D you know, everything. C And it tends to work out pretty well that way. I can anticipate, D you know, a little better. I usually try to guesstimate C and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount. That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left <laughter> at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway. D So that works okay for me. Right. Uhhuh, same here. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Right. Luckily I don't either. E I mean, D you know, maybe my cat would get sick C but, E I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off <noise>. C But you <laughter> C so you know what I'm saying, yeah. I, sometimes it can be. Sometimes it can be. I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is D like car maintenance kinds of things. C But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing C so. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, that's tough. My roommate only gets paid once a month C and that last week's pretty lean generally <laughter> speaking C so. Right. I, for, for years got paid once a month C and, C and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once. There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were, for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones C but I would pay all of them at one sitting C and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it. C And, C and it worked okay for me. I don't know. Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is C and so, It's, D yeah, it's really bad. C But, F uh, it's going pretty well C and I've got a real good plan mapped out here, C so. Uhhuh. F Oh that's, Yeah. That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time. That'll, yeah, That'll be good, yeah most people are spending three or four months di, D you know, at least, digging out after Christmas C so. Yeah, I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas I didn't get in debt, C so. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. It's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer <laughter>. Yeah. My, F uh, roommate does sew some C and, C and, F uh, i, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time C but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again. My mother always sewed. She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. C But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money. D Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money C so that was, D you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity C and you're actually my first call. Yeah. I had not, F uh, done I, I guess today today's my first day that I could even do it. Yeah, you beat me to the punch, here <laughter>. I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody, C so C so that was great. Yeah. Yeah. I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,
