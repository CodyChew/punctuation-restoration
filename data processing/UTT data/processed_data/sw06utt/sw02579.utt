D Well, good afternoon to you, Mary. First, let me ask you, what's, what's the weather like up there to begin with? <Laughter>. That sounds more like our winter weather down here. F Um. D Well, D you know, I bet that's what we, that storm we had last night. F Oh, we had a frog strangler go sw, sweeping through here, F uh, yesterday and last night. C And we're expecting another one tonight. F Oh, E I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street. Uhhuh. D Well, it's probably on its way up there. It was heading north. <Laughter>. D Well, it was nice today. F Uh, in between the thunder showers, yes. D Well, D you know, what they say about the weather here in Texas? If you, if you don't like it, wait five minutes, it'll change. Uhhuh. W, Uhhuh. D Well, tell me, F uh, is, is it normally that cold up there in, in the Spring? You're kidding? You, are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open? Umhum. Oh. F Oh, Mother Macree. No, I should say not. D Well, I, I, sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had. I hope, it doesn't reach you up there. D Well, I, let's hope it, D well, i, if it's the same as what we had, at least it'll be warmer. Yeah, F oh, boy, the, that, whew, that would be tear disastrous. If you, had that rain storm and freezing weather. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I heard on the news this morning that, F um, one of our local schools, F uh, lost the roof of their gymnasium. C And they suspected may have been a tornado. C But, F uh, F uh, thank God for small favors, the, F uh, F uh, what do they call them? The, the, the marching band or something? F Uh, F uh, had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before. F Oh, C and how. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. D Well, during the winter, yes, we do. F Uh, we've had, F uh, D well, <sigh> past four or five years, I guess, at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain. C And, F uh, of course people down here, they just don't know how to handle themselves C and, D Well, F uh, not only that, C but, we're, we're ee, don't have the equipment to handle it either. F Uh, they go out there, C and the, D well all you can do with, with, F uh, freezing rain of course, is spr, spread sand on the ice. C And, C but, F uh, D you know, we don't even have vehicles that will do that. They, they have to get, F uh, a truck of sand and, F uh, F uh, four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand. D Well, C and then to make matters worse, it destroys your vehicles too. Yeah, they, D well we, they do that down here too. They mix the salt in with the sand. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I've, no, I'm a dog lover myself. <Laughter>. I guess it would be. Oh. F Oh, wasn't that nice of him? F Uh, I have, F uh, a, a Chowperd myself. A Chowperd. D Well, she's part Chow and part Shepherd. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. C But she's the best, the best of both breeds. D Well, June, is medium sized. C But she is scared to death of thunder storms. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, that must be nice. Uhhuh. D Well, good. No, D well, D now, D you know, it sounds D like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere. C Or better yet, down around Saint Petersburg, Florida. Uhhuh. That's what I call home. I lived there for ten years. Uhhuh. Yep. D Well, I lived there in the seventies. C And, F uh, I, I love it. I have two sons still living down there. F Oh, uhhuh. D Well, that's, that's why I was suggesting, F uh, that Saint Petersburg is got, got to be the finest weather in the world. F Oh, I, I loved it down there. Course you could tell, always tell which were the, the na, natives and which ones were the snowbirds. Yeah, the snowbirds were the, C And good, D Well, D well, today, F uh, when I got up it was twentynine degrees. <Laughter> Yes, C and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon C but it's been cloudy, overcast and threatening rain all day. <Laughter> C And we've also had extremely strong winds, fifteen to twenty miles an hour, for the day. Is that right? F Oh, really? <Laughter> We had one of those two days ago. C But not, F uh, C but, F uh, no rain at all yesterday and, F uh, no rain today. Thanks a lot <laughter>. Cu, couldn't you send us some nice weather? F Oh, was it? <Laughter> D Well, the, one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather, how some ever we can't do very much to change it. What's that? F Oh, yes, D well that's about the way our weather is here also. C And I grew up in Saint Louis, C and Saint Louis was much the same. No, it's not. This is, F uh, about, F uh, ten degrees cooler than usual. C But about a week ago we were up to eighty and eightyfive degrees. No, no, it, F uh, it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems. <Laughter> I'm sure I didn't. I was ready to turn on the air conditioning. It, no, it really was extremely warm. It only got down to about sixtyfive in the evening. We had about three or four days of that, C and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and, F uh, temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time. C And, F uh, it has gone down gradually each day. This morning it was twentynine, yesterday it was about thirtytwo. F Uh, cars were scraping, ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night. C So it, it really wasn't too, wasn't too pleasant <laughter>. F Oh, I hope, not. D Well, they are predicting rain and thunderstorms, C and I wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had. F Uh, yeah. <laughter> Yes, warm rain, D well, of course, by the time it gets up here it may ru, run into a cold front coming down from Canada. Yes. Yes. We had, F uh, a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the, F uh, of the city of Dayton itself. C And, F uh, then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour. It was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning. D So, it, it wasn't, F uh, it wasn't conditions to being out in it C and I had just gotten home. We had a lot of tornado warnings also. C And I had gotten home shortly before that, F uh, the rain started. C So, F uh, I felt a little more secure that I was at home rather than having to be out driving in it. Is that right? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, they, that was, ca, very, very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous. D Well, of course this is tornado season, F uh, in to, F uh, we have many tornadoes spawned in this area. And northern Indiana, now we're in the southwestern part of, F uh, Ohio, just forty miles north, due north of Cincinnati, C and, F uh, C but, F uh, northern Indiana, has many tornadoes come roaring across. C And we get the backlash off of it, if not the part of the tornado itself. C So, F uh, we, D you know, we get a lot of bad weather in this area. C But of course you're supposed to be the sun belt, C and I do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion. Umhum. Right. Yes, I was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed, to, F uh, having to, drive in it. Right, right. C And, Right. Umhum. Right. D Well, F uh, D well here what they do and I, I contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do, they spread salt. C And of course the salt does melt the ice, C but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes, F uh, a perpetual problem. F Oh, it sure does do that. D Well, sand, and, F uh, C but I have learned to do, is, F uh, A now that I am alone, is, F uh, to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car. F Um, not only in case I need it for that for traction but for additional weight, in the, back of the car. C And then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that. I don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of, that C but, yeah. D Well <laughter>. D Well, the dogs don't use litter. C But kitty litter is excellent for, F uh, getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction. Uhhuh. Yeah, it, F uh, works out, F uh, really quite well. Course I have, I have a dog also. My son brought me a little Lhasa Apso, F uh, for my birthday last Thanksgiving. He brought him from Dallas. He, Yes, that, F uh, he just thought I had been without a dog, F uh, for three years. That was long enough. He, he had, F Oh, a what? D Now that one I'm not familiar with. F Uh, okay. Okay, that makes sense then <laughter>. I believe, Yes, right, D well, I've always had big dogs before. Never had a little dog before. C And, Yes D well, F Oh, D well, I had a German shorthair that was frightened of storms. The minute it would begin to storm, he would just panic. C And, F uh, I had to push him down when he was fourteen, C and two months later I had to put my yellow Lab down, because he had leukemia. C And, F uh, <sigh> then, F uh, then there was no point in having all my acreage. I had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides. F Oh, D well, it was great. I loved it. C But then I didn't need all that anymore, so I finally sold that, C and I'm in a fair size condo. C And I have a nice size patio. C And, F uh, C so this little dog has plenty of room to run. Yeah, C and he is a, a cutie C and, F uh, C but I've never had a dog I had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either <laughter>. C And it's, <Laughter>. Is that right? F Oh, is that right? F Oh, D well I was there once way, way back in nineteensixty, I think for just a week's vacation. C But, F uh, I, that's about the only time I've been to Florida, except passing through on the way to someplace else. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. Umhum. D Well, F uh, F uh, most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida. C But, F uh, I have just, that's just not been my thing. We used to always head west or head north. Now that I'm alone why, F uh, I, F uh, prefer to travel overseas if I'm going anywhere. C And, F uh, course there too you never know what the weather's going to be. When you, start getting over, to, F Oh, is that right? F Um. Yeah. F Oh, is that right?
