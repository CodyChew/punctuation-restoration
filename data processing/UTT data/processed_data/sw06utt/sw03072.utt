Okay, where have you all been on vacation recently? Detroit? Is that a nice vacation spot? Right, okay. Right. C So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot? F Ooh, that would be nice. Did you scuba dive there? F Ooh, that would be nice. F Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break. I haven't been on vacation in a while either. F Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, F uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing. C So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, C so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long <laughter>. Worked at a camp there, C and so I got to <breathing> spend a lot of time up in the mountains. C So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation. Oh. That's nice. We, F um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River. C And that's the best place that I've ever canoed. It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, C and we <breathing> to have, F uh, we stayed at some park C and they had <breathing> a little <breathing> F uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, C and he would give a little talk about <laughter> mountain things. D You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, C but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river, C and we would have to, we'd C and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found C and, That's a good family place to go, C and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, C but it wasn't, D you know, too easy either. It was like, That's true. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. D Well, that's good. D Well, we, F um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, D you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that. C And then I went to England a few years ago. I was a, student there and spent, F um, a semester studying abroad in London. C And that was a great time, because it's D so, that's such a neat place C and it's, there's not a language barrier C so you don't, E I mean, there <laughter> there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't <breathing> exactly know what they mean, C and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, C but <breathing> it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year. It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time, C and that's <breathing> it was really different being in a big city, C because I don't get much into urban, D you know, really urban areas a lot C and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are C and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, C but it ended up being kind of nice <breathing> because you're not accountable to anyone. You could just kind of <breathing>, kind of walk around and observe, I did a lot of just going out by myself and <breathing> riding on the subway and watching people. C And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting. Yeah, I know, I <laughter> keep wanting to get up to, I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States. I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or, Oh. Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there. Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, C but I'd have to have a <laughter> tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that. C So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, C and that was even nice because there wasn't, F uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and, Yeah, we have. <laughter> We. We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe. It was <laughter> just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, C and you slept on the train at night. C But there wasn't a, it was strange, it was kind of sad, there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English C and everyone in Switzerland, knew English. C So <laughter> we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in <breathing> and got seated, C and then no one knew English in there, C and we were just <laughter>, finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things. C But it was, F Oh, I had fondue. That was easy to say <laughter>. Tried to get fondue and white wine, C and that was, we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly. There were some people at the next table who spoke English, C so we <breathing>, elicited their aid for a while C and, they were very helpful C so, It was, it was a pleasant time. I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time <laughter>. There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything. Right. That's <<faint>>, <Laughter>. That and sleeping late <laughter>. I keep hoping for. D Well it was nice talking with you. C And have a good afternoon. Okay. Goodbye. Okay. Recently, my most recent trip was last year, C and that was Detroit. Yeah. D Well, it wasn't really. It was, F um, F uh, to see an old relative. C And it was, F uh, just to, F uh, <lipsmack> have some fellowship with her. No. The only thing that I, I visited that, D you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico. C And that was real nice. F Uh, No, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there. Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from. F Oh, D well, that's nice. Yeah. D Well, my, F uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, C and that's canoeing. C And, F uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, C and they also, F uh, F uh, have been to, F uh, I guess Colorado, C and they've really enjoyed it. It's a whole new, Uhhuh. F Huh. Sure. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's neat. Sure. Uhhuh. D Well, you learn a lot of, F um, skills too, C and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills, C and I think they really <lipsmack> it really pen, penetrates in your memory, D you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do <laughter>, C so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning. C And you're more receptive. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's exciting. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I had a friend that, F uh, visited England not, D well, I think it's been probably two years now, C but that's her next goal, A C and she can do it, is go back to England, C because she really has a great desire to do that, C because the love that she, F um, has for it now after visiting it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Do your own thing. Yeah. Uhhuh. That's wonderful. There's a lot out there to see, I'll say. D Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada <laughter>. C So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around. D Well, you've been quite a few places there <laughter>. <Laughter> Once you think about it, F huh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's great. Uhhuh. That's great. Uhhuh <laughter>. What did you wind up with? <laughter>. F Oh, okay <laughter>. F Uh, uhhuh. They kind of guided you. Uhhuh. D Well, good. I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, F uh, pursue our dreams. Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yes. Uhhuh. I understand that. D Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig. You do the same. Thank you. Byebye.
