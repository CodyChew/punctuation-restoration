D So what kind of weather have you had in Dallas? <Laughter>. Really? Yeah D see, I didn't, I don't, I thought, F uh, I thought, I lived in Euless C and I thought it was pretty normal, C but <breathing> anyway, C but I guess you're right though it has been real hot, C because it, F um, I've had to use the air conditioner in March, my husband usually, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Noise>. Yeah. Yeah, I know, <Noise> The trees are real pretty right now and everything. C And, F uh, I don't know. I know the pollen is real high, C but I think it's higher than usual, isn't it? Yeah, I know. It's been bothering me a lot, C but yeah, I think, nor, I think the weather overall has been, F um, probably like you said, probably a little bit warm C and, F Uh, Anyway, D so we basically live in the same area C so it's real hard to, I know. I just think it's been warm, C and it's been hot, <noise> C and I liked it, C and it's beautiful, C and all the trees are pretty, C and I wish it would stay like this all the time <laughter>. D So yeah, I could too. C And, F uh, gah, I don't think we can say anything else really. Yeah, that sounds like a good deal. D Well, you have a nice day. C And we'll talk to you later. Bye. D Well, it's been very windy, C and it's, F uh, probably unseasonably hot for time right now. Yeah, we've already had to use that, C and we've had D like, E I mean, this is probably typical though, F uh, we, like tornado weather and tornado warnings, C and, F uh, <lipsmack>, D so, F uh, D you know, I, I forget from year to year. I'm getting too old. C But, the, F uh, it, th, the wind's blowing very hard, C but I guess, D you know, we're just out of March, C and, F uh will bring the rain in, F uh, April. Yes, it is. Seems very high. It hasn't bothered me, C but I know that people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high. A little bit warm and a little bit blowy, I think. Really hard to make too big of different comparisons, right? Yeah. Yes, I could stand this all summer. I don't think we can either, let's cut off. You too. Byebye.
