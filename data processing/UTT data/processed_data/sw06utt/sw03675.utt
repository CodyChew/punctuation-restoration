Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, no. F Uh, into savings. Oh. D Well, that's pretty good. Boy, that's pretty good. Sure. Yeah, it's, it's tough here too. You have to have the contractor sign with you. C But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it , where I live, that is. Uhhuh. F Oh, bad for him, F huh. F Um. Is that right? Wow. D Well, that's kind of handy. I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book. Pretty interesting. Texas has quite the history. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's kind of what we do. We, F uh, we're L D S C and so we pay ten percent tithing C and then, D you know, we put I guess it's D like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account. C But that sometimes we use for emergency type things. C But, F uh, C and my wife doesn't work. We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do. D Well that's pretty. That's a great position to be in. Is that right? Oh <laughter>. What kind of consulting do you do? Is that right? I'm into computers, too. I I'm a E D P auditor. C And. Ye, and P C s. Yeah. I'm just brushing up on, D well, C plus plus. Uhhuh. C And, Three F oh? <Laughter>. Oh. You got a buy. Sure. Melted, or Just wet C or, Okay. Yeah, our budgeting plan includes me getting a job <laughter>. We're, we're at the point now, I go, I quit working about six months ago to start this house C and I'm out of cash C and I'm not out of project yet. C So, F uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work. As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate. F Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes. C So, D you know, the project's kind of halted until then. C But as far as budgeting is concerned, D you know, we have, F uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, D you know, we always put ten percent back, C and that's a never touch. Yeah. Either savings or investment, one of the two, C but we don't ever put it in a high risk. It's just always going to be there. C And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, F uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, D you know, we, F uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, D you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food C and the rest of it, D you know, we pile into the house. C And, F uh, D you know, I'm fairly fortunate. E I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that, C but, F uh, we're still making the payments on them. It's just, when you, D see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself. Right, exactly. Yeah. C And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished, the bank can eat the contractor. Yeah, bad for him. C But, the homeowner can't be touched. It's a homestead state. Yeah, D see right now if I quit paying any of my bills, the only thing they could do is cut off electricity. They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period. D You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything that's not the tools of your trade, C but as far as, F uh, you know <laughter>, you're pretty much bullet proof in this state. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, D you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, D you know <laughter>. We just going to spend it all. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, F uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, D you know, we don't have any long term debt. D You know, F uh, we paid cash for car. D Well, we bought the car on time, one of them, C but we, D you know, we since paid it off. The land is paid for cash, C so we don't have to worry about that. D Well, it's fraught with other problems <laughter>. Yeah, I'm not very motivated <laughter>. F Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms. Yeah. Right. Oh. You into mainframes? An, F oh really? Are you really? I just got that a few days ago. F Oh, gees, don't get me to lying. I bought it at a fire sale. This guy's place burned down, C and he had a bunch of computer stuff, C and, D you know, I bought it all. It was two hundred bucks for everything he had. D Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, D you know. D You know, a lot of the, F uh, diskettes were just totally unusable. D Well, yeah , or wet <laughter>. C But I did get out of there with, F uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,
