All right. What is your favorite show? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. It really is. Uhhuh. I watch just about anything, C but not a lot of, T V. E I mean I'll watch, D you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening. C And I usually watch, D you know, the news C and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, D you know, C and I like the NINE ONE ONE, and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. Uhhuh. Now, I do, like, my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening. C And I, F uh, Uhhuh. C And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny. Uhhuh. D Well, his favorite night is Monday night C so we've got to where we will sit, and watch it on Monday night, C because that C and then that, F uh, F oh, I can't even think of the name of it. D Like I say I'm not, Yeah, C and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis. Sergeant, F uh, MA, MAJOR DAD. Yeah, that comes on right after, F uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN, and DESIGNING WOMEN. C So we always, he watches that C and I kind of s, I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others, as I can. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though. Except they, probably are in bed, by nine. Did you get your pizza taken care of? <Laughter>. D Well, do you know, I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked C and that's SISTERS. Have you watched that? It's really, D you know, it's really pretty good. E I mean, it's kind of like, D you know, F um, soap opera I guess. C But it's a, So far it, I've watched it about three times now C and it's really held my attention. It's been pretty good. Some, pretty good acting. Now I watched, BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time, C but I haven't, I did. I liked it. Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet. Uhhuh. It's nearly, too late for T V. That's the way I am. I get in, from work C and I'm tired C and I sit and watch for a few minutes D so I have to get up and do dinner, and everything. <Lipsmack>. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's us. If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos, C so. C But there are some good shows on. I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do. C But I like, I don't know I, I'm always in to making things C and, C And I don't just spend all my time, C and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on. C But, F uh, C but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed, C and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week. Yeah. I never get in in time for any of those. <<Very faint>> Yeah. D Well, it's nice talking with you. Bye. D Well, I was just trying to think. When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others. F Um, I love watching some of the, F uh, new, new shows basically. C And we, F uh, to, we subscribe to C N N C and we took that, C and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake, C and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this. The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, D you know, D like the, F uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things. C And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, F uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here. We have little ones. F Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE, C and we think that's kind of informative to teach them, how to handle things in situations. What do you watch? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's the same thing we do. Uhhuh. Yeah, that kind, that's the kind I like really more than, the sitcoms. I haven't gotten, into many of those. I have heard that's real good. That's, Burt Reynolds, isn't it? Yeah, I've heard that. Now someone told me that C and also, F uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN, because they said that that was really good this season. You've got to <laughter> yeah, Uhhuh. DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night, too. F Huh, I don't even know. F Oh, okay. Now I, we've never even seen that. Uhhuh. On the others. D Well, D you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY. C Or, F um, It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING. C But, F uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot. F Oh, excuse me just a minute <<talks to someone in the background>>. <<very faint.>> The money is right there on the thing and the coupon. F Oh, I know. That's the thing. C And so, we, Uhhuh. D Well, they are. In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight, C but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off. Yeah, he has gone <laughter> to get it. Thank you <laughter>. F Um, C but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing C and that's the day my husband, wants to. <Laughter>. No, C but I saw that advertised today C and it sounds like it's not fluff. It sounds like it's good. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's what they said it was kind of, a little more drama to it. D Well, C and a, C and another one now that it's getting darker C and you are wanting to cocoon more, that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE. Some of these, that are nostalgic. Did you, like it? Did you? D Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, D you know C and, I haven't seen it either. I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, D you know, it's almost too late to start, something new. <Lipsmack> Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, C and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights. <Laughter> C So, it's D like, we are kind of, tuned out of our T V. Yeah, D well, we do too. Yeah. I don't know, yeah. There's a lot more to do with, with your time when you get into it. Uhhuh. D Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends. They don't have children yet, C and they just turn it on when they walk in, they turn it off when they leave. C So they are used to that too. Yeah, I understand. Same here. Yeah, it's real good. C And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those, D you know, talk shows. I like her. Yeah. D Well, it's, it's nice talking to you. I guess we've kind of exhausted this one, C but it's nice talking with you. Thank you. Byebye.
