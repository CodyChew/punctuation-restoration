Okay, I guess tonight's subject is, F uh, woodworking. Do you, F uh, D Well, k, kind of, mainly the woodworking I've done lately is, F uh, made D like, F uh, for example a little nativity scene. F Uh, not the, F uh, the whole figurines and so forth, but mainly the stable, put some shelves in and, and some odd stuff around the house C and so I, I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking C and I do it out of hobby more than, F uh, D you know, something I have to do. How about yourself? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, I'll have to come and see them <laughter>. That sounds like a good idea. I, D you know, C and that's, that is right, it is out of necessity C because lot of the things that, F uh, D well, we can't be able to afford, C but also I, I sometimes think that, F uh, I enjoy doing that C and I like to get out and, and, F uh, to work with my hands C and, F uh, sounds like you got some real nice tools, too. Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, a entertainment type center? Oh. Right. Right, right. Right, E or yes, I, yeah, I'm aware of that. C And also with a router, you can, F uh, make ornamental facings, too better than a just straight wood edge. And, F Uh, And, F uh, casings and so forth that are, that are real nice, C so that's, that's good. That's good. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well C and with a radial arm saw, if you do have a, a big piece of wood that you need to rip, like you say, or cut, you wouldn't be able to do that. F Uh, C but, F uh, yeah, a table saw does take a lot of time, E excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment. C And, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. No, they don't have basements. D Well, I'm from up north also C and, C and, F uh, no there's no t, basements down here C and it's kind of, F uh, hard to get, F uh, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that. Yeah, lot of the equipment, too, that I've, I've used in the past, F uh, I w, D you know, I've used in school C and, F uh, I would, I don't know, I'd, I'd kind of like to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a table saw and some of those things that would make, F uh, some pretty nice, F uh, pieces of, F uh, D well, wood, for, for different things for tables, for, for, F uh, chairs, for, D you know, decks and so forth C so, I don't know, I, I just enjoy woodworking C and I think the, the main thing is, like you say, it's a, it's a good out. It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day C and it's a great stress, stress reliever. Yes, I have, in school I have C and I've made, F uh, F uh, different things, F uh, la, F uh, tables for chairs C and I've made, F uh, bowls, C and, F uh, C and, F uh, What kind of woodworking do you do? Uhhuh. F Uh, D well, I like to think of it as a hobby, but I, I guess also, partly out of necessity. Just repairing things around the house. F Uh, a few years ago, F uh, we needed, F uh, they needed some book shelves C and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves C and, F uh, it actually worked pretty well C and over the years I've, I've refined those plans. I got myself a router C and I'm, I'm very good at making book shelves. It's, it's also a way of relieving stress. My wife kind of laughs, at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves. F Uh, D well, yeah, E I mean, little by little, I, I started out <laughter> with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things. F Uh, gotten a, a good belt sander C and, C and, the router, F uh, helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router. The latest project that I've been working on A C and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a, a cabinet to, to put a T V in. Right. C And it, that's works well because you can design it to, to suit whatever equipment you have C so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the, the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment. C And, F uh, that's worked pretty well. F Uh, with, F uh, with the router you can make nice, F uh, <lipsmack> I guess dado joints is what it's called. F Uh, C And it's, F uh, That's right. That's right. D So, C But what I need next is a good table saw. C And I, I debate whether it's better to get a, F uh, just a straight table saw or to get one of these, F uh, rotary arm saws. Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called. F Uh, it t, seems to me the radial arm saw is, is better, D well, it, it takes up less room. E I mean, you, you set the wood down C and you move the saw. Whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw. Yeah. F Uh, that, that's partly my problem now. I don't have room for this. I, F uh, I, where, F uh, where we lived before up north, F uh basements were, were common C and, I used to put all the stuff in my basement, C but not so here in Texas. Yeah. Uhhuh. Have you ever used a lathe?
