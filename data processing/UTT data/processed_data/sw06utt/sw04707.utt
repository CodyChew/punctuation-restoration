<Laughter> I went, <Cough> I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon. <Laughter> Are you eating? No it's, Say what? <Throat_clearing> Tell you what we can do is, F uh, I can punch the, F uh, one, C and then w, after five minutes when the, F uh, F uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want <laughter>. <Tone>. F Uh, I love the irony of, F uh, talking about this subject on April the, fifteenth <sniffing>. C But, F uh, I'm afraid I'm, I'm probably in the minority. I, I actually don't think that we, F uh, pay too much in this country. F Uh F uh, particularly, F uh, in this part of the country w, F uh, I guess I do have a, a bone to pick with, F uh, F uh, the way taxes are distributed <sniffing>. F Uh, I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form <sniffing> C and the sales tax can't. I think that's regressive C and, F uh, F uh, it's kind of dumb. D Well, E I mean, nobody taxes groceries. Where? Is that right? <Throat_clearing>. Right. Right <throat_clearing>. C But I guess when I hear, when I see the comparison between the United States and, F uh, any other western country, F uh, their, their rates are D like, F uh, fortyone, fortytwo and ours are D like thirtysix, thirtyseven, D you know, if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well. T, th, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are. Yeah. Uhhuh. I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Right. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes. Yeah. I suppose that's true, yeah. F Uh, probably m, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever C but, <Throat_clearing> Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, since, F uh, <inhaling> I send my kids to parochial school, that. It's not, it's not quite the bargain that. <Cough> <Throat_clearing> C But, E I mean, I pay them gladly. That's a decision, I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a, F uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f, with the same tax money. C But, F uh, E I mean, that's, that's the way Americans want to interpret it, I guess that's all right <swallowing>. C But, yeah. I, C and if I were, F uh, when I was single and again when I'm retired, I will not mind paying, F uh, what it takes to keep the schools good. That's always been a high priority <throat_clearing>. <Throat_clearing> I do, yeah, that's true. I think in places, I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, F uh, F uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, F uh, just looking for fun, th people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens. C And, F uh, <throat_clearing>, there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done. That seems a, a, like a cultural lapse. E I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools. They, Right. Yeah. People would rather, F uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools <laughter> because it means more to them. C But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted. Yeah. D Well, Not very good <laughter> it's not been a good day <laughter>. <Noise> <TV>. I don't know. I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn C so I hope she's turned it in. F Uh, I ju, <throat_clearing> go ahead, I'll stop eating. I just barely got home from the university. I just barely got home from the university. <Noise>. <Laughter> Okay, go ahead, fire away. <Talking>. I agree with you <TV>. F Huh. I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax. C But, on the other hand, I don't mind that it's only on, D you know, things that aren't like <throat_clearing> groceries and that, it's not on that. F Oh, yeah, they do. In Arizona. Uhhuh. C But we have a pretty low income ta, E I mean pretty low tax rate here. F Oh, I think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it. C But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes. D Well C and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, D you know, <throat_clearing> difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, F uh, what we pay for it. D Well, E I mean, I think, I was in Germany, D you know, for several years C and <throat_clearing> I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there. Higher taxes. Yeah. Still's that way to some extent. <Throat_clearing> I think the other problem is, D you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about. C But I look, for example, C and you're not quite in the same situation C but D like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world. I wish I didn't have to pay <throat_clearing> any more fo, to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes. Yeah, that, that's probably a little tougher on you <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Sniffing>. <Tapping>. <Tapping> No, I think that's just you though. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places. Or build roads. <Throat_clearing> <noise>.
