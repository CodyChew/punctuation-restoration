F Oh, yes, very appropriate, I guess. F Uh, you ready for this? Okay, John, just a moment. <Beep> D Well, guess what, we get to talk about the weather <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, you do C so you, you, you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather. I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather. <Laughter> D Well, D actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, F uh, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, F uh, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirtytwo. C So, yeah <laughter>. If it keeps on raining like this, C and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night. F Oh, yes. Uhhuh. Wow. <Laughter> C And so are you an airline pilot? F Oh, great. For Southwest, fantastic. I have a brother, I have a brother that's a pilot, also, with American. Yeah. D So I imagine you, F uh, F oh, with all this kind of weather it, F uh, makes it kind of dangerous for you. F Oh, I guess so, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. D Well, we moved D actually down here from another location, C and it's spectacular the, the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain. Pardon me? <Laughter> I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas. Lights up the whole sky and even on a, on a, D actually I've, I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky, it's a cloudless night, C and the rain isn't falling, C but you can see the thunder, and, E excuse me, see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth, and what a light show. It's, it's fabulous. Yeah, that's true. I'm from, F uh, northern Utah, C and that's a very arid climate, from, F uh, Salt Lake City area C and there's always a lot of snow. In fact, where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to, F uh, twelve different major ski resorts, C and so there was an awful lot of snow, C and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and, and sleigh riding and everything <laughter> else. C So, we had a great time. F Um, yeah, in, F uh in Snowbird and Solitude and and Brighton and D yes, all those areas. D So I imagine, have you skied before? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, . Yeah, great. D Well, do you think this, the, the weather is typical for this time of the year? <Laughter>. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's been, it's been cold. There was a time, though, in the, F uh, middle part of November that got really cool, really, really unseasonably cool C and then it warmed right back up, C and I thought, great <laughter> C and that's, that's a fun th, yeah, my wife was just listening here C and she said, yeah, it froze in fact. C And, F uh, C but, F uh, I've really enjoyed the weather down here, too, C because, F uh, two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat, weather, C and it's not as severe, I should say as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah. <Laughter> Down here? Not in Minnesota <laughter>. I have a brotherinlaw that lives in Minnesota C and they say, boy, six months out of the year it's bitter cold, and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything. Uhhuh. about the weather <laughter>. Yeah. The weather is, F uh, this time of year has actually been kind of unusual. I haven't expected it to be colder until, D you know like we've gotten the last couple of days. I don't know. I fly for a living, C and I've, F uh, the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, it was around here last night, I'll tell you that <laughter>. No kidding. F Um. Saturday or Sunday they were saying, yeah. Yeah, I know the systems have been real strong out. I went through, F uh, Phoenix on, twice on, F uh, Wednesday morning C and, F uh, approaches to low minimum both, both times C and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather <throat_clearing> C so, Yes, I am for Southwest, yeah. F Oh, is that right? D Well, D now, I wouldn't call it danger. This is, F uh, this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in. This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime. Yeah, the, the air systems are reasonably calm. We don't have, F uh, the turbulence have a, F uh, little bit of chop, C but it's not like it is in the spring time. Spectacular is the right word for them. Spectacular is a good word for them <laughter>. It's amazing. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah cloud to cloud it can be real, really sensational here. Where are you from originally? Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Were you near, near the Park Cities area. Beautiful area. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, we've skied, I have not skied that area. I've driven through it several times. F Uh, I skied, we skied California a bunch when we lived out there, C and C and, F uh, F um, C and, of course, grew, we grew up in Minnesota, C and we do some skiing there lot of cross country skiing there. D Well, not really, I, D you know, Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow, F um, the, F um, F uh, we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already I think C and, F uh, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today, D you know, that moved in last night. Yes. Yes, it did. Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was real cold. Yeah, C but that was very unseasonable for us down here. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, that's, that's real true. Same with us from Minnesota. It's, it's, F uh, in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, F uh, New Year's Day one year. Yeah, yeah. No no, no no. F Oh, it is, it is. D Well, C and they've had, F uh, D you know, usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and February, C and they're up over sixtyfive or sixty,
