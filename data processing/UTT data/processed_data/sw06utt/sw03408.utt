I was going to say, my, F uh, college is Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota, C and our head football coach, Dennis Muir <<phonetically spelled>>, used to be an assistant coach at B Y U. D So I thought that was kind of an in, interesting coincidence. F Uh, Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota. I ju, in what major or what year? International business. Yeah. C And you? Okay. D Well, that sounds interesting. How long of a program is that? <Laughter>. D You know, I read a study once, C and it said that, F uh, like thirtyfour percent of, F uh, college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program. It took me, it took me five years. D C So, you just, you get started C and you change your mind, C or you want to pick up a second major, if you're management, you, you, thought, I, I'll take that marketing, it's just only was three more classes D you know, C and you, just doesn't happen that you get out in four years. C But. My advice is is, F uh, look for, at the student to faculty ratio, D you know, if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one, I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one. Yeah it was about twentysix to one. Yeah. Which is, D you know, it, it's interesting, C but it, it's what I thought was nice is you could al, there was always time to talk to professor, D you know, C and, C and they knew you. You weren't just in their class, D you know, C and so you could, you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time, C and, C or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever, D you know, you could sit down, talk to them about a problem. They're always willing to help you out. C So, C but I, I's, I, I put that against, F uh, my high school where we had, F uh, a biology class of three hundred and fifty students C and. Yeah it was a biology lecture class C and, D you know, it, it just wasn't the same. You're sitting there, C and you're taking notes C and, D you know, you got a computerized test scores, multiple choice, because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test F uh, D you know, a three hundred fifty person short answer test. C And, it just wasn't the same. You, you'd run, you'd pass the teacher in high school C and, even in high school you could say high to your teachers, unless you're in that biology class, C and they just, they'd look at you like, do I know you? or should I know you? Do you get, F uh, a lot of tutoring, C or. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. C And you could get there C and his office hours could, E I mean he could have D like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have fortytwo people waiting to talk to him, C and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway. D Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college? That's excellent advice. D Well, it, it, it does get it. D You know, you get to the point where it's, I'm never going to get done. D You know, E I, I mean, I was taking summer classes C and let me get out of here. C But, F uh, no, that's good advice. Even if you don't have your major decided on, have an idea what you think you might want, D you know, D so you don't want management, C but you think you want business, F Oh, really. F Huh <laughter>. D So you went to what college? C And what did you graduate in? Yeah, major <laughter>. F Oh, really. I'm going to B Y U, C and I'm going into nursing C so. Forever <laughter>. Seems like, anyways. It's about five years, C but it's probably going to take me longer, because I didn't decide to major in that until, <sniffing> F uh, about a year and a half after I was already in school, C so. F Oh, really. That sounds. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. D So what is your advice to picking a college. Uhhuh. Is that, what was yours more like? Was there a, Really. F Oh, that's great. Uhhuh. Wow, in high school? Oh. Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, there's, it's, the classes here are pretty big, C so, it's hard to get individual help <throat_clearing>. It's kind of, you're on your own <laughter>. No <laughter>. Very little, E I mean, D well, D like my, for example, I have, I'm in a chemistry class right now C and there's tons of students in it, C and there's one T A for the whole class. C And he only has certain office hours, C and so there's only certain times you can talk to him, C and. Right, yeah. F Oh, man. I think your advice is good. F Um let's see. My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college <laughter> C because I, I didn't, C and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to, C and, F um, I don't know, I just feel like I'm, it's, it's going to take me a lot longer than, C and not that's always bad, C but it's, I don't know, it's frustrating, I guess. Right. Yep.
