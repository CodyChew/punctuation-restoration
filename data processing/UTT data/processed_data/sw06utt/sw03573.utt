Okay D well, All right. F Um, F um, D well, F uh, tell me about the car that you've got. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's very interesting. I've had, I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got. It's a, C and surprisingly it's also an eightyfour <Throat_clearing> C and, F uh, <Throat_clearing> Yeah, I'm still here. F Um, E I'm sorry what? Yes, it's an L X, it's not a hatchback, C but it's, F um, it's, F uh, Four door, yeah and very, very comfortable car. Big roomy trunk F uh, and, F uh, and very happy with it, C and I must admit it's, D you know, if, if, if, F uh, my only consideration were, were, D you know, buying another car just to tool around town in and make, D you know, brief trips and things like that, I would very, very seriously consider buying one. F Uh, I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars. F Um, my, my real concern with, F uh, F uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, F um, trip down the road about once a month, because I'm divorced C and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina C and, F uh, I drive, down Interstate Ninetyfive, C and it's just an absolutely wild highway. Yeah C and, Uhhuh. C And, you, D well, you've got it, C and, F uh, C so having precious cargo in the car with me <laughter>, as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, that, F uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo. In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past, C and F uh, I've, I've, they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service, C but, F uh, <sniffing> I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them. F Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person, C and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, D you know, need to be taken care of, and so forth. C And I guess that's one thing that, that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood, C and, F uh, F Oh, I know. It's really amazing. It's, F uh, <laughter>, Absolutely, incredible <laughter>. D So, F um, yeah, D anyway, I've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth, C and I think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about, the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own C and, F um, D Well, certainly some of the top end ones. You can still get, get, F uh, even the, the low end wagons, F um, for less than twenty thousand dollars C and, F uh, we get, D you know, in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here C so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any week, C and I sort of, D you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth C and so, F um, <sniffing> D anyway, C and that's, that's the other thing is that I've, I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person. I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life, C and I've tended to, F um, to, F uh, buy cars that are, D you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old. This Honda that I have I bought used, C and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it. I've just rolled seventy thousand miles, C and it's a seventyfour, E I mean, an eightyfour. C So <laughter>. Yeah. There we are. <Throat_clearing> D Well, I have a Honda, F um, hatchback, nineteen eightyfour. C And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventyeight version before this one. C And, F uh, I'll be honest with you. I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, F uh, put together C and it, it does its job. All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirtyfive hundred miles, C and I, I did have to put two, two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles, C but that car just purrs like the day it was built. I get fortytwo miles per gallon on the highway and F uh, twen, twentyeight to thirty driving around in town. It's a five speed straight stick machine. C And, I can carry more in that, F uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars, C and I have a large, F um, Pontiac, C and I have a sixtynine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old, C but it's in beautiful shape. C But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other bigger cars. F Oh, F oh. <Throat_clearing> L X? It was an L X? Uhhuh, yours is a four door. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yes, they are. F Um, uhhuh. <Cough>. Ninetyfive is wild in any car. There's no doubt about that C because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, E or used to, I'm retiring the end of this month C but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, it just, just sits there and purrs, C and you, all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter. I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas. Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful machine. <Laughter>. Is that right, uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars? Uhhuh. F Um, uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, my, my eightyfour just has seventyseven on it C and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where my mother lives, and things like that, C and I drive it,
