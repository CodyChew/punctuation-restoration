What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, D actually? F Uh. Right. The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home. I've, F uh, F uh, become available to come and go more often, C so I said "hey, it's worth it, I'll just go at the matinee hour C and I can see what I please." It's no more costly than renting one. The last, D see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO C and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects, kind of gory and lots of, D you know action. F Um, <laughter> do you know that I don't follow performers, I don't follow actors. <laughter> Some I know, some I don't. F Uh, C and he was the guy, the guy that played in it, A he was not the star, C but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, F uh, <sigh> F oh, the one about the old people. COCOON, uhhuh. He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON. I don't, I don't know what his name is. Yeah. At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND. That was with Richard Dreyfuss. C And, that one was just a very poignant story, it, it, it had people, it was, it was <noise> D you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie, C but it was, a very, it was a poignant humor C and there was, it was like, F uh, F uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS. The characters played very well off one another. C And there was humor involved, C but the story was a very dramatic story, C and I enjoyed it very much. What are some others that you have seen lately? F Oh, whoa, yes. That's one I can watch, over and over and over again. It sure was. C And, D you know, the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it. There are a number of good movies like that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Right. You don't work? Okay. D Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day. That's right. There's nothing wrong with that. Go in the early hours, it's a matinee, it's not crowded C and the price is as reasonable as renting a video. C And that's the way I do it C and I go quite frequently. If you are going to be planning on doing that, D now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, F uh, witch hunt that is, D you know, magically shot into the present time. C And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded, there was more gore than I was interested in seeing. C But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, F uh, I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either. C But, F uh, the action was comfortable C and, of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things. C So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore. C And there were some others, C but they were done a little more tastefully. C But, F uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet C and I could not handle that. I said "whoa, <laughter> I'm glad I have not had dinner". Then, F uh, I saw AWAKENING, that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro. I, F uh, I, F uh, Robert De Niro, what did I say, Peter? I said Robert De Niro. C And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, F uh, disabled person. C And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing. <sigh> Even when he's sad, D you know, you great faith that he will get happy again. C And then, F oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos. I guess, I can wait another month C and they will be videos. One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I've heard a lot about that one. They say if you really want to be, F uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see. C And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television. F Uh. Uhhuh. And then THELMA AND LOUISE, I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie. <laughter> It's about time for one of those. I want to go see that. C And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES. Uhhuh, I've heard it's wonderful too, C but I, it's just that they are both very long F uh, movies, C and the matinee starts before I can get away from work. C And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back. Uhhuh. D You know, I saw that C and I really <laughter> I cannot remember too much about it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's right, I remember now. Yeah, I remember. Uhhuh. D Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies. I think he ought to stay <laughter> Indiana Jones. <laughter> I realize that he would like his career to develop, C but I don't want to see him in other things. <laughter> C But, F uh, I tell you, Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies. I don't know he was too. Yeah, I didn't care for the type of movie, C but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed C and <laughter> I didn't like him. C But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older. F Oh, yeah, yeah, he does C and there is just a, there's a, I don't know, F uh, I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not. C And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time. <laughter> C And, I enjoy those, C and I enjoy some of the Michael J. Fox movies. I didn't care too much for the last one either. It just was not enough to it. F Uh. No, no, no, it was called, F uh, <noise> HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray trying to portray, portray a policeman. C And that, F Oh, I gue, I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple weeks, months ago. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. COCOON? Okay. F Oh, okay. F Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though. Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I'm trying to think, F uh, just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, again and that's one that, Yeah. I was going to read while it was on, C but then when it started, I just couldn't, D you know, read. That was a really good movie. Yeah, there's quite a few, F uh, movies out now that I would like to go see. My husband, is not a real big movie goer, C and I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go. C Plus, by the time you get a babysitter, and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive. No, I stay at home. Yeah. <laughter> Go during the day, that's right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh. Robert De Niro? I think you said Peter. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, D you know, I think I read about that too. Yeah. F Oh, you haven't, I've heard that is wonderful. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that's, we, F uh, we, F uh, rented the other one, I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, F uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, F uh, <sigh> Harrison Ford, I guess he's in there. C And, I thought that was really good. It was the one where he was a defense, F uh, not defense, he was a prosecu, cuter. C And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A 's office. C And then he ended up being accused of it. Yeah, C so, E I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was <laughter>. I was never into those movies, either. Yeah, I thought he looked real good with a beard, too. Yeah. What was the last one? I'm trying to think. F Uh, the last, D like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one. F Oh, okay, trying to, Yeah.
