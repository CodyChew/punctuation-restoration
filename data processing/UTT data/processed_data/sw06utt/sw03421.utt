D So, D so what have you seen lately that, F um, you think is worthwhile? No, I, I saw the previews. Does, does he, does it have a happy ending, C or. Uhhuh. F Oh, that was funny, wasn't it <laughter>. Yes, C and, C and, C and, C and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, D you know. Yes. Right. D So, now these are for two very different movies. One, one, F uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, D you know, serious subject. Yeah, I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes. F Um, my most recent, F um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH. I only rented it, D you know, maybe a month ago C and it's been out for a couple of years, C but. Have you seen that? D Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play, C and it's beautifully done. F Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit C and there might be a word or two changed. F Uh, C but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie F um, C and I like, as you know, these, these, these sil, silly movies, C and I also like just some strange movies. Do you have any. D Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, F um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER. F Um, C but there are also these various, F um, David Lynch movies. F Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS. That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on. Oh. F Um D well, I don't, I don't especially recommend, E I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing, you have to like, did you see TWIN PEAKS? No, D so, okay. D So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either. They're, they're just strange. D Well, F uh. I think suspense is the right word. F Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric C and, F uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too. That was the television show. F Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, F um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies. F Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY. F Um, C but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, F um, F um, what, what are the titles, I can't remember the titles any more. C But, some really weird ones, F uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters. F Um, it would have made, D you know, these Fellini movies look normal. I do, I do like movies a lot. Do, do you rent them, C or. Yes. Yeah, that's what my wife does too, F um, E I mean, she falls asleep <laughter>. C So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal. D Well, D well it was good talking to you. Take care. Okay, bye. F Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDIN, REGARDING HENRY. Have you seen that yet? It's really good. I loved it. F Um, it's, F um. Yeah, really good ending F um, F uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I generally don't get into movies that much, C but I saw that one, C and then before that one, I saw, F um, F oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF. Yeah, did you, have you seen that one? Yeah, it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it <laughter>. C But it was silly. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. I haven't seen that yet. Right. F Um. Such as <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. I haven't seen any of those. They're really good? Huhuh, no. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Are they, E I mean, is it, like mystery, C or suspense C or, F Oh really. F Um. Right. D So do you like, F um, movies a lot? D See I don't do, I don't. Right. D See, I don't do that, I don't go to movies that often, C but, just recently I've been to a couple <laughter>. <Throat_clearing> F Um, no, we, I just go to D like the dollar movie theater around here generally, C but, I don't know, I just, I usually fall asleep <laughter> C or I get bored pretty easily C so. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, that's exactly right. Yeah, it's good to talk to you, too. Uhhuh. Byebye.
