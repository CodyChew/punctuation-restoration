Do you have any? Uhhuh. All right. Yeah. F Oh, that's good. You don't often find that, I don't think. Right. Uhhuh. Sure. There's a, okay, F uh, that's interesting. Yeah, the only pet that I've had, F uh, I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now C and in my, in my earlier days as a student <sniffing> I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine C and, F uh, it was an amazing dog, it really was. They had, he had gotten it from the pound C and, F uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a dom, a Dalmatian C and we trained it from a pup, C and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained C and it can do a lot of things. It will get beer for you out of the fridge, C and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff. C So, it's really, <throat_clearing> it's, it's kind of a show piece any, <laughter> more, C and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino <laughter> D you know. Yeah, it's, F uh, she's been a real good, a real good dog C and, F uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm go, I'm away from it now. I, I j, I actually live in Florida C but I'm on an internship up here for a year C and then I go back down, C but, F uh, yeah, Domino's a real good dog. F Uh, what, F uh, possessed you to get the dog? Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that. That's good. That kind of builds some character a little bit. <Scratching>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's something that's important for sure. I think, F uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, F uh C or, F Oh, I see. F Um. Yeah it's not that big of a problem. With Domino, she was full grown, I would estimate seventy pounds. C And, D you know, we lived in Oviedo, which is a small town, it's a suburb of Orlando C but <throat_clearing>, there's not, there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around, C and she was a dog that loved to run, C so that was the biggest problem I saw, C and I think that's one of the, F uh, the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is, D you know, do you have the room for this dog to run around, C or, s, D you know, I guess you can't really say for cats. Me and cats don't get along too well, F uh <laughter>, C but, D you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important. Right. Yeah, that, that, Sure, C and that's all part of y, of keeping your part of the relationship. D You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those, F uh, those issues. D You know, C and also, the whole, whole thing with noise. My mother, F oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them C and, D you know, we h, we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, F uh, Brittany Spaniels C and they're very high strung animals to begin with, C but, F uh, Yes, we do have a pet. We have a, a dog that we got from the, F uh, D well, we call it the S P C A It's the, F uh, an, from an animal shelter. F Uh, he'd come in there as a stray. F Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross. F Uh, D well, he was very well trained when we got him. F Uh, he's, No, F uh, we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, D you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him. C And, F uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, I think so. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Yeah. D Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, D you know, complications come with it. C And then with our children, F uh, at the time they were, F oh, grade five and, and grade eight, C so it was an age where it was, F uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet. F Uh, Yeah, right. C So, D Well, that's the idea. I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps, F uh, it depends on the, on everyone's discipline. C And, F uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, F uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog C and, F uh, we've had him about four years now. F Uh, C but I think it does, it, it, D you know, it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, F uh, Yeah. F Uh, Actually no, we live in a, in an area that's, F oh, probably about two and a half miles from the university. F Uh, we live right, might say we live right in, F uh, in the middle of a residential area. C And, F uh, C so that is not as good, F uh, D you know, this dog, being a small dog it's, F uh, more you, more acceptable C but again, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, it's, F uh, that's one of the biggest concerns. It's D like, F uh, there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal, C but the same time, one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal C and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise. Right. D Well, Uhhuh.
