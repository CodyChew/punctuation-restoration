All right, I, I think our experience of camping is, I, I am the, the passive member, I get things ready and then I enjoy. F Uh, C because, my, my husband is a good camper C and so they, he manages the troops C and they do the work C and I have fun <laughter>. That's when we camped the most. When, I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, F uh, I, it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just, F uh, was really overworked, D you know, C and, C and getting out into nature and relaxing, and having the family do a good share of the work, D you know, C and the part that I did was more fun than, F uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, D you know. It is, isn't it. It isn't. Ha, what kinds of things have you tried? Have you done, F uh, F uh, F uh, the big pot cooking? F Oh, yeah. Big frying p, F Oh, that's interesting. D You know, interesting enough, F uh, the food part was kind of, F uh, important thing in our camping. F Uh, when my oldest son, F uh, always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything. C But the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, F uh, F uh, cooking merit badge in, C and, C and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff C and, F uh, E I mean, D you know, he did it up really good <laughter>. C And so, F uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it. It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, F uh, follow the instructions, D you know and do. C And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things D like I would take corn bread and, F uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, F uh, stove. C And it works real good. It's like an oven. Just put, F uh, put a thing on it. What did you like to do most? That's neat isn't it? Right. I agree. <Laughter>. F Huh. D Well D now in Florida, is ther, is there ti, are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot. Uhhuh. F Oh, is that true? D Now, D now we're, we're in Texas now C and you're in Texas, right. Okay, F uh, we have not camped a great deal here because, F uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping. I gue, Yeah, yeah, we have done that <breathing>. C But, C but we camped mostly, when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and w, F Uh, in, F uh, Allendale and, F uh, and, F uh, Waldwick, it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border. C And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp C and it was so, D you know, pick your own, F uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast <laughter>. F Uh, also, go ahead. F Oh, are you? Where did you live? F Oh, F oh yeah, I know that. I had a cousin who lived in White Plains, that's a, that's a neat area. C But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because, Yeah, it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by, you don't have to go very far. C And, F uh, C and there's, F uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, F uh, hiking sort of things C and, C and we had, F uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat. C And so we would sail and, and, F uh, did a lot of camping that way. <Breathing>. F Oh, do you. We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis C and it's fun, too, I think. Do you? That's neat, C so you kind of, F uh, F uh, an everyday camper <laughter>. A full time camper. D Well D now, are you living alone now, C or, You and your dog, F huh, <laughter>. Hey, that sounds great. D Well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we used to, C but, F uh, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family, and enjoy nature and, F uh, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life. I'd always, right, I'd always come home just relaxed and, F uh, comfortable and ready to go at it again, C so it was a neat activity. Good to talk to you. Tell me your name again. Jack, all right. Ye, yes, we've been here, we're, we're in Plano, C but we've been here about, F uh, eighteen years. Are you, are you, how about that. D Well we're all, lots of people from T I up this way. All right, good to talk to you. All right, all right, byebye. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, F uh, your, you said your family was gro, F uh, all grown up now, how about when they were younger, did you go cam, take them camping? Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah bu, e, even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it. F Oh, F oh, F uh, D well, it was really my ex who did the, the, F uh, F uh, the cooking back when we first started C and we found that the, D you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, F uh, F uh, F uh, hamburger helper. Because all you needed was a big frying pan, you dumped everything in together C and it was enough for all five of us, six of us. Oh. D Well that's great. Uhhuh. D Well, cooking was our secondary interest, E I mean. D Well really just commune with nature. We started out, F uh, D well we were living in Florida at the time C and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive. D So my ex decided, we're going to try camping C and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent. C And that's how we got started. We did it for years and years, F uh. D Well, ye, F uh, yes and no. E I mean, F um, ye, in the winter time yes, it's, it gets kind of chilly E or it can get chilly. C But, F uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go. F Uh, C becau, Yes, I'm in Dallas. D Well, it just depends on where you go, for instance, if you went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water. F Oh, where abouts? Uhhuh. F Oh yes, yes, ye, I co, I come from up in that area, I'm a New Yorker myself. A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains. D Well that I wouldn't know I left there when I was quite young. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, me, I outgrew, F uh, sleeping bags and, F uh, tents, C and I now have a motor home. D Well I live in mine. Yes. F Uh, D well, yes I consider myself what they call a fulltimer. Yeah th, Ye, D well just me and my dog. Yeah. F Oh yes, definitely. Nothing like the fresh outdoors. Jack. Uhhuh. Are you, F uh, from Dallas too, Beth. Oh! D Well that's where we, that's where I am, Plano. Uhhuh. Nice talking to you too, Beth. Bye.
