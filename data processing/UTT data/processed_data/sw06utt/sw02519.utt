D Well, how about you, are you an exercise fanatic? Me either <laughter>. Do you? Yeah. Wonderful. Uhhuh. Way. <Laughter> That's the way to do it. I'm kind of like you, I've never really gotten into it, it's just a, it's just a chore, D you know, C and I finally decided one semester, I'm in college and I'm taking night classes and I still don't have any of my P E classes, C and so one semester I thought, okay, that's what I'm going to do C and that will get me where I'll have to do it, D you know, C and they were offering a, a walking class, where you, D you know, you have to walk, D you know, that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes, you get, you get points, D you know, D and then you have to go in once a week and log your points C so it's not D like you can do the class D like anytime you want, D you know, C and, at the end of the semester you go back in and your, D like your final exam is a three mile walk. C And if you walk it in this many minutes, you get an A, this many minutes you get a B, C and, I thought, F oh, this will be an easy class. C and, D you know, C and I did it, C and I did it for a long time D like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot, C and this has been a couple of years ago, C and, D you know, I had, I did that, C and I just ended up having to drop the class. D you know, by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet, let alone walk three miles, D you know. C But, that was the only time I have ever been able to D like start an exercise program and really stick to it, because then I had to, I had to go every week and log in what I had walked, C and, my teacher looked at it every week, D you know. C But, other than that I just, D you know, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say, okay, I'm going to start going to aerobics now, D you know, C and, I'll go for D like two weeks and go, this is for the birds, this is too much work. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But that's, you're amazed at how much that adds up. I was on, F uh, Nutri Systems for a while, C and, that is one of the things that they really stressed doing, D you know, when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door, park at the other end, D you know, E I mean, C and they stretched, stressed things like that too. D You know, during, when you're sitting watching T V at night, during every commercial get up off the couch, go to the living room and get a glass of water, go to the bedroom and make the bed, go do something, but get up during every commercial. And, things like that. C And, you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up, D you know, just gives you a little more activity C so, especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway. Yeah. D Well, I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before I had mine either. I've never been, I just, I'm more into, D you know, sitting, than I am <laughter>, C so, C but, D you know, I have found that with, I have a two year old, C and I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before, because now, D you know, he'll "I want to go outside" and I'll go outside with him C and we'll walk up and down the street, C and we'll go to the park C and I'll run around with him and stuff like that, that, C so I'm getting more, D you know, more exercise that way than I ever did before I had him, D you know. C so, I think, I think that has helped a little bit, I don't know. Just chasing him around the house, D you know, will be plenty for you. Right, right. You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there. F Oh, lucky you, you're getting into even more interesting stages. Uhhuh, yeah, yeah <laughter>. Same thing, F huh, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen <laughter>. How interesting, I can hardly wait <laughter>. Yeah. Right. That, that walkabout's a good program. It really is, D you know, when they first started it, I, I got all the information, of course, C but just like everything else, I was real gung ho with a friend of mine, "Oh, we're going to do this, we're going to do this," C and we did do it for a long time, C and then I started school, D you know, C and D like two nights a week I was going to school C and then the other two nights a week my husband worked, C so I had to pick Ryan up, D you know, there's always an excuse, D you know, to not do it C so, Yeah, F oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. Yeah. here to here, here, <Laughter> Yeah, yeah, to the mall, to the movies, to the friends, to the, Sounds like fun. D Well, it was really good to talk to you. Take care, talk to you later. No. I'm definitely <laughter>, I do like to walk. Yes. Since T I has, F uh, F uh, instituted that, F um, walkabout, I have gone out and started walking even more, bought me the, D you know, the proper shoes and everything to get started, and, F uh, park out there, D you know, way out there in the boondocks. It was so funny the other day, I took some guys to, to lunch C and when we came back they said "Oh, there's a parking space real close," and I parked way out in the boonies, C and I said "you can walk off your lunch." <Laughter> Yeah. F Um, F um. Oh. Uhhuh. F Um, F um. F Um, F um. Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, no. Uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, no. Yeah. F Um, F um. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. There you go. <Laughter>. D Well, D you know, I have noticed too that, F uh, when I started the exercise, F uh, not the exercise but the walking program, F uh, that I did tone up, D you know, like all over, C but it didn't get the upper part of my body, C and, F uh, C so, what I do, is I bowl. I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling, C and I used to bowl five times a week, C so, I really loved it, C and I still bowl at least once a week now, on a league, on, on a, C and I'm bowling on the T I league. F Um, C but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor, so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel C and that way I get the little extra exercise. I'm always explaining to people, I do little things like that, like, D you know, take the stairs instead of the, F um, the elevator, C and, I do silly things like that versus a, a regular program that you would have. It sure does. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. There you go. F Um, F um. F Um, F um. That's true. That's true. No, I used to, I really did, F uh, years ago C and, F uh, I was thinking about that not too long ago that I used to walk and not only did I walk C but, I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V, C and I would tape them, C and then I would do them D like two times a day, C but I don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore. I think having children everything just kind of, everything goes by the wayside. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Me too. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Um, F um. F Um, F um. Yeah, yeah, running, Oh yeah, tha, that's enough. D Well, mine are older now, doing, F uh, their own things C so, F Oh, yes. Yes, I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old, C so. Yes. Yeah, yeah. We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager <laughter>. Yeah, you watch it'll be exactly the same <laughter>. <Laughter> It does, it, it absolutely does, C so. Yeah, I, I, I know, I just know you can't. C But, no, I don't get as much exercise as I used to C but, I at least, since T I has implemented that program, I do, I'm more aware of it, C and, D you know, that I'm need to do this, that and the other C and, F uh, C so, I try to do combinations of things but not, like go down to the President's Health Club, like I see all these people do. It is, it is. Yeah. F Um, F um. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. C And, it gets worse, it doesn't get any better. Yeah, because I'm constantly running my children around someplace C and that's where I actually get my exercise, is running them from here to there, in the car. There you go, that's it, that's it. D Well, it was nice talking to you. Yeah, D well okay, we'll talk to you later. F Um, F um. Byebye.
