I'm ready if you are. D Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them. Especially if they go hunting, which my son goes hunting. He goes deer hunting. He goes duck hunting. F Uh, he's read books about guns since he was D like probably eleven or twelve years old. C And I just think that, F uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, D you know. As far as just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around. D Well, no. There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things. Yeah, D well I suppose you could. F Uh, Uhhuh. C And I think if they want one, they're going to get one. D You know. The bad guys are, D you know, like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one. D Well I agree with you on that because I know, F uh, in fact I had bought my son a rifle D like for a Christmas present one time. C And for a rifle there's no waiting. There wasn't anyhow. Now there might be now. C But there wasn't anything for, D you know, rifles and things like that. I guess it was just handguns that there was a, some kind of a waiting, D you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something. C But, F uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, D you know, robbing people and shooting people, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, D see D now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago C and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show. There's no restriction though. You don't have to wait or nothing then F huh? Yeah, I was just curious, D you know, because, F uh I know at, at the regular gun show, D you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple of weeks C and then they check you out, then they call you up C and you h, go pick it up. Which I think <noise> they have to do on rifles and things now too. I think there is some, something like that. Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now. C But, Uhhuh. Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that. C But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a, D like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was D like he twelve or thirteen years old. C But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it. He goes to the pistol range C and th, C and the rifle range to shoot them. He likes to go to that, F uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, F uh yeah, right <laughter>. He likes to do that D you know <laughter>. C But, F uh I don't know. I think they should try to control it and everything, D you know. C But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen. Uhhuh. Yeah, right, right. Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for, they can be, D you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun. D You know, D now when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up C or, D you know. Uhhuh. D Well they can get into almost anything anymore <laughter>. Okay. F Um, wh, where do you stand, F uh, on, Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I agree too. I, F uh, it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, F uh, to completely ban guns. There's just too many. Right, C and I, yeah, right, E I mean, yeah, that, that's true. C And E I mean the, the technology's not that hard. E I mean, you could make a gun, D you know, from simple, D you know, D you know. D You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. F Uh, <Cough> <throat_clearing> F Oh, D you know true. That's true. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, E I mean, yeah there's, there's no way to stop, F uh, stop anybody from getting a gun. F Uh, <dishes> I think there should be more control as, D like, F uh, D like maybe waiting periods and things like that, D you know, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, I, I know my friend is, F uh, really into guns C and, F uh, F uh, w, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, D you know, that come through town and everything C and, E I mean, they just have, E I mean they have anything you'd want, E I mean D you know, D you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and <breathing> there's, E I mean, there's nothing. You can just go buy one and take it home C and it's easier than getting a, D like a video membership card at, D you know, a video store. F Uh, yeah, yeah. You just go and, F uh, buy the gun C and, F uh, No. D Well, except for the, the pistols and th, I'm not sure how they do that. I know they, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Right. Yeah. I think that's, Uhhuh <noise>. Yeah. Yeah I'm not sure, I'm not really sure but, what F uh, th, the gun laws in P, Pennsylvania are like. No. Uhhuh. <Cough> <<someone in background>>. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. The skeets, you mean? Uhhuh. Yeah. I don't, D yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either. I just don't, I don't see, C and, then, I, I think, F uh, hadn't thought about this before C but if you do that, if they would, F uh, <breathing> F uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, D you know, a black market for them. C And so, D you know, they, they would just, all the profits would go to, D you know, Yeah. F Oh, th, Oh, yeah, the owner's responsibility? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, D you know, that's, that's true. F Uh, D you know, I, I had a friend who was a, F uh, <lipsmack> <sniffing> a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, F uh, one of the little neighborhoods, D you know, one of the small towns, F uh near Pittsburgh. C And, F uh, she said tha, that, that, F uh, D you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that C but, E I mean, D you know, you're, D you know, people make, D you know, they forget or, D you know, D you know, kids get in, the way kids, the way kids are, D you know, E I mean, they can, D you know. Right.
