Okay, D so you're into microwave cooking. , yes, C and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it, something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work. I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week. Uhhuh. I know. I try not to make too much. It's just my husband and I, too C and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week <laughter> C but, F uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, D you know, something like that or sometimes a roast, C but, What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party? F Oh, oh. Uhhuh. Ooh, that sounds delicious. Uhhuh. We, I end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy C and, F uh, it go, you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad C and that's about it, D you know. F Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts C and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, F uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves C and you mix it up, C and you just put it on the top of the chicken, C and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour C and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes C and it's delicious C and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, D you know, and then, F uh, go about my business, C and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's re, chicken's done. C So that's a real easy thing for me. Uhhuh. F Oh, really. No, I don't, my mom gets that, C but, Really. Uhhuh. F Um. F Um. F Oh, my goodness. Uhhuh. D Well, I love cheese cake. I have never been, I don't know, the ones I have made I have not done that well with. I like a baked cheese cake, D you know, I don't, I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, D you know C but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake. C And, F uh, the recipes that I've used, everybody will say, F Oh, this is real simple, C and then I make it, C and it's, it's really not very good C but yours sounds good. I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness. F Um. D Well, that sounds interesting, C so there's your good dessert for your dinner party. <Laughter> Are you into serving wines with your dinner party? Me, either. I wish I knew more about it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They would be, if you just had time to do it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, how neat. Uhhuh. F Um, D well, I didn't even know they were offering that. I guess I, Uhhuh. F Oh, D well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do. Yeah, it's just, it's so easy nowadays, D you know, C and it's, F uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave C and it be ready in just a few minutes <laughter>. Yeah. All week. D Well, we've done that, too. There's just my husband and I, C and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot o, F uh, pot of spaghetti C and, D you know, we're eating it for a week and a half, C and I kind of get sick of it after he <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Right. Right. F Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas it's, it's really good, I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with C and, F uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it. C So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make. What about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, what do you put in it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Ooh, that sounds good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Ooh, that sounds good. Is done, right. Yeah, that sounds good, too. I've got a, F um, a great recipe for cheese cake. I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING, C but they have one, if you like to cook, they have, every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one C and, F um, D you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes, C but, <lipsmack> I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake, C and it's just a regular cheese cake, C and then you can put raspberry, F uh, topping on it C but inside the cheese cake, F uh, recipe you put, F um, lemon peel and orange peel C and it's just enough to taste it, D you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake, C and it is wonderful, C but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for fortyfive minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another fortyfive minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another <laughter> fortyfive minutes and then you're supposed to, F um, I think, chill it to room temperature C so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day, C but it's, it's very good. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. No <laughter>, it's not. Right. It does, C and it, it, it is really good. Right <laughter>. F Oh, sometimes, C but E I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means. I've been to, D you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley C but, F um, D you know, C and I learned a little bit about them then, C but D you know what would be fun, they have some of those classes you can take yeah, C and then there's places, F um, do you live in Dallas okay, there's places here that, F um, offer, I think it's D like once a month, you can go and, to a particular restaurant or whatever, C and you can kind of take a cooking class C and then you get to eat everything afterwards, C and then they also go into the wines, D you know to serve with, D you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing, C and it sounds like it's a lot of fun. D We have some friends who've done that, C and they've really enjoyed it. Yeah, this place is called D like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that. Yeah, it, it sounds like, like it,
