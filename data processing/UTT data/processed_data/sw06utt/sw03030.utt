D Well, hi. I guess, F uh, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, F uh, a gourmet club here. F Um, which means that we have D like eight, eight people, four couples. C And most of the husbands, this is really peculiar, most of the husbands cook. E I mean, the wives during the day, D you know, get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day. F Um, D you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff, C but it was the guys that got together and did all this. C And, F um, D like my husband just, he really, really likes to cook in terms of, F um, F oh, barbecue, C and E I mean all guys, I think, like to barbecue. I think it's caveman, I'm telling you, C but, F um, he really does cook C and it's a good thing because, D you know, you can't, you can't knock that. C But all these other guys do too, C and so we've gotten together C and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals. C And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do. You, D Well, we try, E I mean, C because D you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that. It's like, D you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well <laughter>. Yeah. C So, E I mean we originally started out, D you know, when we were younger <laughter> and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids. F Um, then we would, we tried to do it every other month, C but lately it's just been once every six months <laughter>. Yeah. Oh. Really, really <laughter>. F Oh, it is absolutely. Yeah <laughter>. Right. F Oh, yeah. D Well, yeah, <laughter> that's true. C And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish C so E I mean he can get within, F Oh, my. F Oh, yeah. It sure d, it makes you, F uh, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like, Right. C So we, we try to keep all that in mind, C but otherwise, F um, I guess, D you know, entertaining, F um, I, I guess I have recipes I, F um, C but that's, that's basically what we do is the gourmet, C so, D you know, they would be pretty elaborate. F Um, C but it's fun. E I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff, C and, D you know, you get all prepared C but you're right. It's very, very rich C and I'm glad <laughter> we don't have it every, C because it is, it's a, quite a treat it really is. F Um, Right, C but D so, you like food C and I just love the, the community of food. I just, think it's neat. I just love sharing meals and, and whatever you can do, D you know, to do that. I don't think you have to be, D you know, more than hamburgers and hot dogs out, in the backyard and the, and the coleslaw and potato salad. C But, C but, Oh. <Laughter>. What are you providing? Right. Right. There you go. I know. We're all not built like, F uh, what, what, <lipsmack> F oh, Martha Stewart, D you know. We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and, and time to, D you know, sh, t, Yeah. Shot a video of the whole thing, I don't know. C But it's, it's really kind of a neat thing. I get a kick out of it. I, I really do. Everything, all parts of the food, E I mean I love to make things from scratch, D you know. Making breads C and, C and D you know people really pretty much appreciate it. F Oh, I think so. Oh. Oh. Oh. There you go. Oh. F Oh, it is. E I mean, we have bakeries around here that, D you know, you, you just gain weight going by the door, D you know, just like that. Right, C but I don't know I guess some of the best things I've ever had, F um, I, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, D you know. Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that, I have a kick making that, E I mean, D you know <laughter>. I get off on strange little details of food, I guess. C But F um, gee, we have so much going on here because <static> D you know this is Dallas, this is the southwest, this is, D you know, chips and Picante sauce and anything hot. D You know you can always make it hotter, and, and lots of stuff like that, D you know, C so. That's, F um, a really good party time, eating all that hot food C and, C and they just love it, D you know, down here. It just just, D you know, all the stuff that goes with that, C so. F Oh, I'm not. Thank you for noticing <laughter>. I'm from Chicago. C And how I got, Really C and how, I got to Texas by way, of Virginia I'm, and everything is a long story. C But, Yeah. D Well, absolutely. I, in fact, it just came to mind, F um, C and this, Uhhuh. Great. <Laughter>. F Oh, that's nice. Right, right. No. <Laughter>. How often do you meet? F Oh, yes, yes. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. D Well, that's much more reasonable. I was involved in a, a club like that for, F um, that, D you know, where we tried to really do gourmet, F uh, meals. C And, F uh, we, we were a little bit too frequent I think. I don't remember if we were once a month C or D anyway it was, it was difficult. By the time we went around it was, F uh, four couples C so, F uh, by the time we got around, F uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost tired, D you know. F Um, partly because, F um, wh, gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining. It's too rich. C And, so, i, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day. F Um, C so, F uh, we, we kind of, C and then one of the couples, F uh, moved C and so we sort of didn't, didn't continue it, C but, F um, C and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as much time for, F uh, regular entertaining, C but, F um, F uh, F uh, when, when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, <lipsmack> F um, <breathing> kind of h, good for everybody C and that's, that sometimes means you can't do gourmet, because depending on who your guests are. F Oh, yeah, D well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all. F Uh, C so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese. F Uh, D well, I take that back. F Uh, she can't eat some cream cheese. C But that, that really limits, F um, F Oh, yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, wow. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Sounds wonderful. F Oh, D sure I do too. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Sure. D Well, my, F um, <lipsmack> daughter is graduating, F uh, Sunday C and so we're having, a, F uh, few people in Sunday afternoon. C And I did a cop out on to it I'm buying cold cuts <laughter>. D Well, I have to, make a cake C and I have to make hors d'oeuvres C and I have to make dessert C so, I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches. F Uh, C so, F oh, I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on. C But I can't do it, D you know, working fulltime C and, it's just too much. Those people that try to do everything. Yeah <laughter>. Ugh <laughter>. <Breathing> Wouldn't that be nice? <Laughter>. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, they do. I, it's very difficult to purchase, F um, <lipsmack> items that are as good as what you can make yourself. F Um, in spite of, F uh, C or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive. In fact, F uh, I just got back from a shopping trip to purch, purchase the cold cuts C and I, I bought turkey and pastrami and, and barbecued ham at a, an Amish market near here. C And I've never been there before. And found that there's, F uh, individual vendors C and the foods are wonderful. C And one of the, F uh, the, F um, <lipsmack> vendors had cakes. All sorts of wonderful cakes. F Uh, they, fresh str, strawberry cheesecake now and, and so on. C And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. F Um, which is really not such a bad price. I decided I, I just couldn't quite make myself, F um, buy it because I do make cheesecake C and somehow I didn't want to do that because it, C but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful, C and the, they had black forest cherry cake and all those things. That ar, C but those are homemade. They are not, F um, commercial bakery made. C And in that they are made in their homes, F um, C so it, it's kind of interesting, F uh, it's out there if you want to pay the price C but, <Laughter> Right, just smelling the air <breathing>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. <Laughter> We like hot food too, C so. Right. You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though. <Laughter>. <Laughter> I thought, I thought, that there was a slight difference in accent. Right. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> I'll bet. Did, F um, do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy C or is it always complicat,
