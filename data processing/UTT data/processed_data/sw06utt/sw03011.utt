Yes, I live in Dallas. Yeah, I think right now it's, it's kind of bad <baby>. F Uh, I don't live in a house, I live in an apartment <laughter>. Are, are you in a house? Okay. Uhhuh. D Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, F uh, compare apartments <laughter>. If it can compare the one that I have now, with the one that I had the last time, the one that I have now, F uh, has a lot more amenities, A I guess is the right word, than the one that I moved out of. F Uh, this one, D you know, gave us free cable and, F uh, ceiling fans C and, F uh, it was practically new when I moved in here C and the carpet was new C and, No, it's not a highrise. It's just a, a two story building. F Uh, C but there's, D you know, there, there are a lot of buildings C but it's just two stories. F Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio C but they have a sunroom instead of the patio. On the first floor, F um, where I am, there's a patio. Yeah. The rooms are nice and large C and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms. C And, F uh,, D Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area C and I, I did buy the washer and dryer, C but they didn't provide it. The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them, C and that's one of the reasons that I did move. Yeah. Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat <laughter>. D So, tell me ab, Yeah. Uhhuh. It just, It's a real good, Yeah, it's a good time to buy, if you're in the market. Uhhuh. F Oh, C so you want a bigger one. Uhhuh. One thing about the houses in, F uh, in Dallas, they don't, F uh, utilize basements the way they did in New York. My parents in New York had, F uh, a, F uh, three family house. Actual <noise> a, two family house where the, the, F um, the downstairs and the second floor they had, C and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, D you know. C And, F uh, they had a basement, C and they, D you know, they finished the basement, C and they were able to rent that out also. C But, F uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses. C And I've looked at a lot of them, <<very faint>> D you know. No, it's a, Right. I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house. C And, F uh, D Well, no. <laughter> No, no, no, D you know, I don't see that kind of sand here. F Um, there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with, F uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, F uh, <lipsmack> E or the foundation is sinking or something. D You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others. C But you, you have to know the right spot, to, to pick where that doesn't happen. C And, <<very faint>> F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. I see. F Huh. Where did you say you're at, Colorado? Virginia, Virginia. That's right. Anywhere near, F uh, Virginia Beach? <<Very faint>> Oh. Uhhuh. D Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind, in, F uh, in Texas I'll say C because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay. C And, F uh, in the, in the Dallas, D you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that. Yeah, D well, Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. D Well, I see. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. D So, is your house in an area by itself? E I mean, it's not connected to another one? F Oh. C But it's not, they're not connected are they? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. All right D so, F uh, you live in Dallas? D Now I understand that, F um, the, the real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down. F Oh. Yeah, uhhuh. Yeah, we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington. <Laughter>. <Sniffing>. F Huh. Do you live in the highrise? Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. C So, C so you just, you have one floor all to yourself? F Oh, okay. F Oh, that's nice. Do you get your own washer, dryer? Oh. Yeah. That is nice. <Sniffing>. Yeah. Yeah, I've always, F uh, been pretty lucky. The real estate out here's been pretty good. It, F uh, the, the prices of, D well, the prices came down last year. We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome <laughter>. The past, F uh, F uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia. It just never happened before. C So it's really surprising everybody. <sniffing> All the developers don't know what to do <laughter>. Yeah, unfortunate, we're, F uh, we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids C and we have a three bedroom house. C And it's pretty much filled up right now. Yeah, uhhuh. Get an extra bedroom or a basement. Right now it's just a, a single level rambler. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. <Sniffing>. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there, C and that's what he said was that, D you know, it just wasn't something that people had down there. They put pools and garages on, but, F uh, no basements <laughter>. F Huh. Maybe it's all the sand. Is there a lot of sand in, I always think it's like a desert, I don't know. <laughter> <sniffing> Dallas always, Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. Yeah. D Well, out here we, F um, we live in what used to be, F uh, D like a prairie or whatever a natural, D you know, natural grasslands. C And, F uh, they, it's just, you go down four inches C and you get to sands, D well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone. C And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast <laughter>. It's just solid sandstone. No, Virginia. Yeah, it's sort of unusual really. Most of Virginia is clay. F Oh, yeah, uhhuh. <sniffing> Yeah. My, F uh, my folks used to live there. Back before I was born, they lived there. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, F uh, Texas is a big state C so I imagine the, the type of houses and, F uh, things like that are truly different from area to area <laughter>. C But, F uh, <sniffing> that's the same way out here C because, F um, D well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington C and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive. C So, D you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway. That's why we came out here. This is called the, the, the country, D you know, with only, D you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C, twentyfive from the city. C But, F um, it's considered the country since it's, F uh, D you know, that far out. C But, F um, yeah, we live out by Dulles Airport. Yeah, C and, F uh, <sniffing> that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here C and, D you know, it's, it's still pretty rural. F Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore. Land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that. No, we're in a development. There's, F uh, D yeah, there's another one half an acre away, E or a quarter acre away rather. F Oh, no. Huhuh. You have to, F uh, stay in one single family home. I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up. F Uh, my folks, F um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids C but, F um, for the most part i, they, they always had, D you know, C and Pennsylvania always had a single family home C and so, D you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home, C and that's all I ever knew growing up, C so. I stayed in a townhouse for, F uh, two years and then, F uh, saved up enough money to, to get a,
