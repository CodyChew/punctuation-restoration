Hi, Maureen. How are you? D Well do you have a family budget? Okay. We do a few things, C and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds. I, I'm an accountant. C And, F uh, he has an M B A, C so, F uh, we were sort of, D you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that. C So <laughter>. F Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget. Every month, my husband, F uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, D you know, X amount of dollars for the month, C and then that money is used during that month. We have a certain budget. <Cough> E Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, F uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, babysitting, things like that. C And, F uh, <cough> D excuse me, if, F uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, F uh, <laughter> we don't buy any more milk <laughter>. C But, F uh, we've gotten pretty good at it, we've been doing it a couple of years now. C So, we, our budgets are realistic C and they are not so stringent and, D you know to make us feel uncomfortable. C And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, F uh, at warehouses sometimes, D like at Sam's and things like that. C But, F uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget C and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month, C but generally, we always make it. Right. D Well, F uh, most of our medical things, we don't, F uh, have to worry about, because of insurance C and they're, they're relatively small. F Uh, we've been lucky. In the past we didn't have that problem C but right now we don't. For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things. D Like we have a car fund C and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not. D So, E I mean, C and I, I can't really remember what it is. It's all part of the savings account. We just keep track of it on paper. F Uh, D you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account. We decide, okay, D you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars. D You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. D You know, Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever. F Uh, C and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up. D Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day. C So, C but, we have the money set aside, C so if it does it's not going to kill us. F Uh, C so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined, C so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through. D Well, in. F Uh, we have a lot of different things. Right now, we save about twentyfive percent of our, of our pay. It, C and it goes toward different things, it's for, D you know, for vacations like I said, for, D you know, emergencies D like for car, F uh, breaks down, something like that. F Uh, C and we also put money aside for our kids college. Neither of us had any help with our college degrees, C and just this last month we paid off my final school loan. C So <laughter>. We're starting our kids a little bit early. Do you, F uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things? Sure. Uhhuh. That's good. F Oh, C and it's not deductible anymore. Yeah. We did, we did that for a long time C and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things. C And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, D you know, C so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget. D Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be, C and then we kept track of everything for a month. D You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, C and from that built, D you know, a cash budget. C So now, E I mean, I have, I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say. C And, F uh, E I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else, C and some months it may be different. It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, D you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing, C but the way we set up, D you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, D you know, F uh, utilities and, F uh, the house payment and all that. those are things you don't really have much control over. F Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there <laughter>, like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment. E I mean, C but again it's a set amount every month. C And, F uh, on special occasions, E I mean birthdays and things like that. We, we don't, we still have fun on things <laughter>. D Well, no not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you C and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything. C So, we got into it fairly cheaply, C and then, F uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house. C So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily <laughter>. Sure, I know. That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education, E I mean jeez, they are one and four <laughter>. We have got a long time to save, my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually. F Oh, no, no <laughter>. What do you do with it, I know. Uhhuh, right. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things. My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work. C And that's all he has, he has a ten dollar bill. C And, E I mean, C so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch. The other times, he'll, F uh, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever. C But, C but he keeps himself on that, E I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch. That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch. That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch. <Laughter>. When he can take a sandwich, D you know. All right. No, we probably should, C but we haven't. C So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable. Uhhuh. F Um, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Hm. Uhhuh. What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for, the, D you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, F uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort, or, D like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for? Oh. Do you kind of continue, call this D like, a part of savings account or a different savings account C or, Oh. F Oh, okay. Hm. Okay, then, D so D like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, D you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing? C Or D like what, what percent, do you then save or something? F Hm, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Okay. Checking account a lot, F uh, not so much credit cards. Now several years back I used to use ch, F uh, charge cards, C and D you know all the time, kind of thinking, F oh, D well it's on sale, D you know, it must be a good deal. There have been times that I have been bad about the credit cards C and so pretty much now, F uh, we don't use them too much. If we travel or something, yeah. But, D you know. Standard, we usually don't. C Or if it, it is a purchase, F uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes. D You know, C so it isn't any extended, F uh, it may be that I picked up something at the store, C but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then, C so it's not any, D you know, F uh, build up on the charge cards at all. C And, C but that hasn't always been the case <laughter>. C So, I'm kind of, I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, F uh, D you know, in the past, C and I don't have, D you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer. <Laughter> Yeah, D well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow. C But, F uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks. F Hm. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house, do you know, how did your budget work C or did you have a budget to, F uh, get your down payment going to get a house? F Huh. F Oh, okay. Okay, F uh, yeah, I just keep thinking all the time E I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, D you know, your priority, A at least mine is to save for the house. C But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment. You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I know, C but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, D you know we make X amount of money and where is it. E I mean you look around C and you go, where is it, you, you haven't made, F uh, big purchases C and that's the easier thing to see, if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, D well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V, or something like that. C But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door C and there's big chunks of your money to pay D like the utilities and the gas and the groceries, and stuff. That you don't have tangible, E I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone. Oh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah.
