Okay. F Um, does, is this something that concerns you? Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. Yeah, D well, I live outside of Dallas C and it's kind of in a little suburb. C So, I feel pretty safe out here C but I know the murder rate is going up every year in Dallas C and that worries me. Yeah. Yeah, there's a little boy just got shot and killed D like last weekend down in what they call the projects, which is D you know, sort of a bad area. C But he was just out riding his Big Wheel C and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun C and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet. That's really sad. I've, D so D you know it must be frus, frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that. It'd be so scary. It really doesn't, it's kind of scary. I think that, F uh, I think the laws have gotten so lenient, D you know the court systems are too lenient. I think that's part of the problem. Yeah, they do that here, too. C But I say, D you know, they commit crimes let them be overcrowded, <laughter> D you know let them suffer a little bit. Yeah, I think so. I think if they knew it was going to be really horrible, wherever they were going, maybe they'd think twice about doing it. Yeah. D You know, the other thing that worries about it is, kids that are doing such bad crimes so young, D you know, D like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people. They, I don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything C but that worries me, I wonder what the next generation will be like. <Noise>. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. <Static>. Yeah. Seems like if they had imme, more immediate, F uh, consequences to their actions it would sink in faster <laughter>. <Laughter> Really, yeah. Yeah, C because it seems D like now, even in the country, you hear about bad things happening. Yeah, I think they have them in Dallas because I hear them talking about in the schools, different things happening, C and they've had some driveby shootings outside of the schools. Me either <laughter>. Yeah, seemed like, like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang C but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that, it's pretty scary. Really, yeah, those machine guns and all that. Yeah, that's scary. It's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore. Yeah. Dallas, they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen C but they <noise> keep losing them all the time C and that, F uh, <barking> D you know, eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because <lipsmack> they won't let them hire any new ones C and they keep leaving. <Barking>. Yeah , they figure, what a heyday, F huh <laughter>. It really is <laughter>. D Well, there's someone at the door C so I guess I'll have to <laughter> go see <barking> what my dog is barking about. C But it was nice talking to you <laughter>. D Well thanks <laughter> same for you. Bye. <Breathing> <talking> <<television or radio>> D Well, I think it does, F um, <laughter> especially because I just moved to Massachusetts and, F uh, they're having real problems because they have so many, F uh, police layoffs. C And, F uh, personally I don't live in a real bad section of town C but, F uh, just because of the general area I live in, the insurance rates are real high on your car C and, there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me <laughter>. How about you? Yeah, I, F uh. Yeah, I recently moved here C and when I was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in, the, in the worst areas of town C and, F uh, my husband, was, was, what he his concerns were D well not that I think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander, just to be in that location C and I thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time C and, C and a lot of kids, D you know, are caught that way. C But, Uhhuh. Yeah, that ex, exactly what happened down here. Uhhuh <Lipsmack>. I know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime <laughter> C and it doesn't seem D like anything is working <laughter>. C But, in, in, on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full. We can't, at least in this area, D you know, they don't have any room to put anybody C so a lot of people just get out, D you know, back on the streets because there's no, they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have. Uhhuh. I know it, they have all sorts of, of rights, that, D you know, are questionable. Maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes. That's true, maybe the punishment should be more severe. I know it. Yeah. Ex, ex, exactly C because they get involved in things so young that they don't really, realize what they're involved in. C And, F uh, some people prey on that, D you know, they'll take, F uh, kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen. <Noise> And, F uh, get them involved in things because, F uh, D well I don't know, I was watching on, a movie on T V, I don't know how true those can be, C but D you know, they, one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them, D you know, you won't have a record because you're under eighteen. They'd steal cars and everything. C So, I guess if they had, more of a deterrent, if they had more severe punishments it might be, C but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial. I think it would concern me even more if I had children, which I don't, C but <laughter> if I had children I wouldn't know where to raise them <laughter> to protect them. Uhhuh. It's true, they, F uh, <lipsmack> C and they, they talk about too, the gangs spreading, D you know, D like everybody thinks of them only in L A and New York C but they spread out to cover more area C and, I don't know, if, if gangs occur much down in Texas. Do they? Yeah, the same in some of the areas around here C but I've never had any personal, D you know, I never met anybody that I knew had anything to do <laughter> with it. Or seen anybody, C but, F uh, that's a scary thing too <noise> because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group. <noise> C And, I think that a lot of people that sort of control them, control what they're doing are older, D you know, business, D you know, trying to control whatever. D You know, Uhhuh. It's true. C And the weapons, my God, the weapons that people have are, some people are mor, seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military. I don't know where they get them <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's the other thing, F uh, is <laughter>, it's hard to even, I can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be. Especially if you're an inner city, D you know, you can't really feel D like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on. C And, you're putting your life on your, on the line everyday. I, F Uh, Yeah. I just read an article yesterday, F um, where this, what used to be a nice town in this area, they had a lot of budget cutbacks. Massachusetts is broke right now C and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy C and, <lipsmack> they had to cut twenty guys from their forces C and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well. C And so, it's like <laughter>, This is a depressing conversation though <laughter>. Okay, I hope things look up <laughter>. <Talking> Byebye.
