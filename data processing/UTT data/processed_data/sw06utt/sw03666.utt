Hello. <Laughter>. D Well, I hit one and nothing happened. What's going on? Are you sure? Don't they usually tell you to say something? Oh. Okay, we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden. What do I do? D Well, I, F uh, I cut it occasionally. Is, F uh, is that good? Okay. C And I edge it occasionally. Yeah, D see, am I good, or what? C And, F uh, F Uh, much beyond that I don't do <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, he is going to build you a fence. Uhhuh. What, for a fence? F Oh, D well, I thought, isn't he the same one? Yeah. D Well, my, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, C but D you know, you ought to get him to g, pull the weeds. Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well C so, Yeah, C so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately? <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, F oh, goody. I thought you were going to say there I thought you were going to say there was a snake <laughter> in the weeds <laughter>. F Oh, God, F oh <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, God. C But, F uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted? Did they die or what? F Oh, they're all, C so they, F oh, are they going to come back in the spring? Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I don't know, F uh, Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me? Yeah, D well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah they, They're really pretty. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, E I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes? We didn't disconnect, did we <laughter>? <Laughter>. Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid <laughter>. What? Uhhuh. You're kidding? Really? <Laughter> D Well, the, F uh, I, g, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas C and that was it. Uhhuh. Wow. Really? F Oh, really <laughter>? Yeah. Uhhuh. I don't know, th, Yeah. D Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes. Not for me either. What do I, Yeah, C but I don't, D you know, I, what do I do, cut it one, D you know, and, and edge it C and that's about it. What do I do with it? No. What's going on, are they going to tell us to stop or what <laughter>? <Laughter>. Isn't it five minutes? E I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens. F Oh, F oh, it's just suggested? What? We could talk, Let's talk about the baby. <Laughter>. Yes, I forgot we had to hit one <laughter>. Our time will be up. D Well, just go ahead and talk, that's all. Yeah. I don't think so. Uhhuh. Yes, I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden. Uhhuh. Good. Uhhuh, you're ahead of me. That's better. F Oh, that's really good. Yeah. I don't do any of that. Really, D well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, A I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too. D Well, he's giving me an estimate. C And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it. No, for my yard. Yeah, he is. Yeah, but ten dollars, or what d, what does he charge, not even that. What does he charge me? It's like next to nothing. Th, it's ten because I, it's forty a month. C But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty. D Well, he won't pull weeds. He says he'll spray them, C but he won't pull them. F Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks C and he's right. That's true. C But he just says to keep spraying them so, Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me C so that was real, No. No. There are two out front I thought I'd grab one of these days, C but I haven't bothered as I walk on by. I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front C and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds C and there was dog dirt in it C and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there C and I left the whole thing C and that was about a month ago. I would rather a snake, no <laughter>. I just left the whole thing. The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it. I haven't gone back over there. It really made me mad. D So D anyway but, F Oh, yeah, now they died. I don't know. I don't know, C and then I got some nice, F uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there C and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather. They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas, then they started to die, too. C So, I don't think any of it comes back C but I don't know, maybe these, sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to. C So, Yeah. Really? D Well, that's good. They're the best kind. They, they're like indestructible. They really grow nice C and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back, C but lots of times they do. C So, We'll see. They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they? C But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time. I hope not <laughter>. <Laughter> Neither one of us is getting paid for this. Yeah, really, I know it. I can't believe this. I got somebody from Utah and somebody, where was the person last night was from far away. C And we get each other down the street. This is so funny. Yeah, I've had Dallas, Arlington. I've had, F uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, F uh, another state, I can't remember, C but she told me about the Utah Jazz, we talked about basketball. C And I don't remember what, what the place was last night, C but I'm thinking Colorado, C but I'm not sure I'd know the place, anyway. C So, C But mostly they're from the area. It, Not for me. D You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds. I know. I know, we're not typical Texans. Bu, <laughter>, I don't know, I hope so. <Laughter> Come on, come on. I don't know. I know. D Well, we can talk about something else. It's just a suggested topic. D So, how's the baby, do you think <laughter>? How's the, Let's talk about the baby. <Laughter>.
