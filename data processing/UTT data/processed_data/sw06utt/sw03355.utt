Garth Brooks, yeah, that's, D yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks. Yeah, in fact I think both of them have performed here. C And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, D you know on the verge of country western. F Oh, wonderful. D Well, then, of course you like him. That's great. C But, D well, I have teen age children, C and so, D you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, D you know, Michael Bolton type stuff. He's my personal favorite. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh, uhhuh. No, no, I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house. C But I've got teenagers, C so. Yeah, that's good, I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, F uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music. It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, D you know, F uh, lot of symphonies C and, I just, I love that, that's probably my alltime favorite. F Um. Right. Right. Relax, Yeah. What do you teach, what grade? Good for you. A certain subject? Good for you. I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, F uh, I was reading my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college <laughter>. Yeah, it's pretty good, it's just a real basic class, C but we're learning a lot, C and we have a home computer, C so it's, it's very interesting. Yeah, the subject of music <Laughter>. I play, I play piano, I took lessons for thirteen years, C and right now my nine year old is taking piano, C and I just got a whole mess of music, I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids. <Laughter> I did it last year, C and, C and, F um, I, I just sub at the school, I don't want to work full time, C so I just sub at the school, C and that's kind of my volunteer thing, C so that, it, it's really neat, C and my older daughter plays the saxophone, my next son plays the drums, C and my third son just started baritone this year, C and my little girl will start French horn next year, C so. Oh. French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument. It's just my favorite. Of course that's what I played, C and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn C and I get a little bit more time. Right now I'm busy chasing my kids. <Laughter>. I do, I do, I love it, C but we have a, a marvelous band instructor, C and, C and he's just, he's wonderful. We have, F uh, couple of hundred kids in the band, our junior high band is just wonderful. He, lot, and their concert band, C and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in, C and my son will be in next year that's, E I mean, they ca, play college level music in junior high, he's that good of an instructor, C and the kids just love him. C So it's really good. It is wonderful. F Oh do you <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay, <laughter> What kind do I like? I like just about any kind except country and western. It's, it's, course country C and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be. D Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks <laughter>. Right. Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, F uh, D you know, his, his home town is about, F uh, fifteen minutes away C so he is, he's a home boy <laughter>. Uhhuh. My son is, F uh, twentyeight, C so, C but he, he's real unusual in that, F uh, he likes a little bit of every kind. He likes jazz and, F uh, blues and, and course the rock I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it. D Well, my teenagers are all gone. I can listen to any music I want to <laughter>. D You know, F uh, I, I teach C and we can have music in the classroom, C but it, D you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that C and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them C and yet it's, it's, it stimulates them, C and C and, F uh, D Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve C and, D Well, it's, F uh, business technology. C But, F uh F oh, boy, F Uh, yeah, I'd learn it too. F Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though. I, F uh, do you play any instruments? Ooh, you took on a, good job. F Oh, D well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn. D So. F Oh, okay. Yes, sounds like you've got a houseful. F Oh, that's a, F Oh, that's wonderful, I, I have totally, totally a tin ear C and I love music. I cannot carry a tune in a basket.
