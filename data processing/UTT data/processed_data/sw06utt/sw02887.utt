<Talking> <<in background>> D Well, I think health care is real important, and dental coverage, C but I guess medical insurance is probably what I consider the second most important. Uhhuh. Right, right. I know no matter what you do about that, D yeah, unless you're D like a Senior V P or something which I am not <laughter>. Yeah, I know. It's, F um, I don't know. C And then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people, F um, expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level. D You know, they'll say maybe we'll pay you X amount annually, C but then we, D you know, ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits C and if you're D like, are you married? F Um, D like my husband works, C and I do C so I don't take some of, I have certain things that I take, C and he has other things he takes. C So E I mean in that kind of situation it's really almost, redundant, D you know, D You know that some of the benefits, I would rather have, F um, money. Yeah, more money, actually, F um, Or flex time or something that was a little more personal, D you know. You don't use, you don't use the medical insurance? You use your, your company's? Where does <talking> <<in background>> he work if you don't mind me, Yo, F Oh, you're kidding. What's the name of that company <laughter>? What do they do? Uhhuh. Are they a big Company C or, Uhhuh, that's, see, that's probably why cause Cana, Canada has the, the, F um, government run health care systems, social medicine. C And you don't pay them. If you live there, it's like Europe. You don't pay a dime. D You know? Sounds wonderful. <Noise> <<making noise with mouth>> <laughter>. Yeah, if I were, him, I'd tell him make sure he stays there. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah, yeah, I don't work at T I. My husband works at T I, C but, F um, I work for E D S, C but it's like, F um, <Breathing> D You know they're both basically, E D S is a little bit better than T I C but, F Um, C and we take my dental, my dental, his medical. C And the medical is just, E I mean, I think it's terrible, D you know? twenty, C but they're, then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna. F Um, I don't know. I just don't think companies, F um, they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system C and, D you know, F Um, T I just did the thing where, with the smoking premiums. We don't smoke, C but did you, do you know about the smoking premiums? Yeah, do you guys smoke? F Oh, yeah. C But then, D you know, D like a lady in my office said, she said her husband works for T I, too. C And she said what about the people that are walking around, C and I hope, I don't, you don't sound D like you're in this category, but E I mean for extremely obese people or something? The kind of people that can't sit in the airline, airplane chair, D you know? D You know, who's going to croak first? The people that smoke or, D you know? Seems like, an unnecessary penalty, yeah. E I mean I'm not all for smoking at all, C but I just, D you know, I don't how they can do it. Carte blanket. *listen Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Or something. Yeah, it's D like, stupid, C but, That's why I'm not a boss, I guess <laughter>. E I mean I don't know, F um. What other, what other type of benefits do they have that, E I mean, Canadian based companies. They have to be a little bit different than the American, F um. Uhhuh. Yeah, T I is at least, <Laughter> <<in background>> five years, yeah. Yeah. <Gasp>. F Oh, my goodness. Uhhuh. That's kind of nice. Yeah, T I has that, C but that's a pretty standard thing anymore. D You know, F um, F um, your husband's company probably matches more than T I, though. F Oh, they do? Yeah, it is. That's still pretty good, though. E I mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension. Yeah, I know, F um, E D S has eight years? I think E D S has seven to, to eight years. C So it's like T I in that respect, D you know? C And, C and, E I mean, C and I'm working for a company that's making money <laughter>. D You know, E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but, F um, not E D S, T I, F um, C but I, I don't know. I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people, the grunts, as I call them, like myself <laughter> to tell them, yeah. E I mean, I don't know, C but if I were to rank them, I guess I would say next to income it's really just health benefits. C And then, F um, for most people I know it would be day care D like T I has, no day care. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I don't, I would, think so, yeah C because, Yeah, they really should because they're big enough, F um, C and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at, I think, right now than, that we have day care, F um, they, F uh, the health, the health program like T I has Texans? C But it, I don't think it, that it's <breathing> developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I. E I mean if you ever walked into E D S s health, corner court health clubs on site and you walk into Spring Creek, D well, Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway C but, I mean, yeah. Ye, F Oh, it's really nice, yeah. D You know, instead of D like six, F um, treadmills, you've got D like twenty. <Laughter> C And E D S can't even compare in size. In terms of the number of employees. C So I, don't know. I guess it's just where they, F um, and D like E D S reimburses you for adoption. C And T I doesn't have anything like that. D You know, C so I guess I, I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect C so, Yeah. Yeah, C and there's, E I mean they have some strange things. E I mean they have very strange D like dress codes C and, D you know. F Um, you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a, y, D you know, C but it doesn't, there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is. F Um, I don't know. I, I guess I also wish that, F uh, companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews. <Laughter>. Oh. Yeah, exactly. I know. I know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, C and E I mean, E I mean, I don't know how you and your husband are, too, C but E I mean we have friends that laugh at us C and we, I clip coupons. C And I said, hey, I'll probably do this even if I'm a millionaire which I won't, ever be. C But, E I mean, it's D like, C because you just can't, E I mean, it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something D well, the car insurance is due <laughter>. E I mean, yeah. I know. I don't know what we're going to do about, Yeah, you, want to rob a bank? No, I didn't say that. <Laughter> I didn't say that on this line. I don't know. What else about corporate benefits? I can't think. It's probably been too hot today for either of us to, F Um, kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas. Usually people are all over the country. This is true. Uhhuh, C and that doesn't definitely make it any better. It's, just something you have to keep telling yourself, D you know, that, F um, that's what I want, that, F uh, D you know, people are lucky to have jobs, C and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits. When you see people that don't have, F um, anything but H M O s or, D you know, E I mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs, D like, we had a guy fixing our air conditioner. C And he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour, C and he has three kids. C And I went, F oh, <gasp> D you know, <breathing> that has to be rough. F Um, C but benefits, I don't know. I guess, <breathing> I guess one thing I'd like to see, too, and I, I don't know how T I is about this, but I'd like to see, F um, employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their, F um, the execution of their job. D You know. Right yeah, that's a good word for it, F um. How is T I in that mode? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. All part of a good old boy network, yeah. Uhhuh. E D S is, F oh, they're better, C but they're a little bit too, F um, stiff collared in terms of, D you know, what you want to do. They're pretty much put the, if that's where the widget goes, stick it in the hole, D you know. They're kind of formula oriented. Yeah, C and, C and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful C so, D You know, what can you tell them <laughter>? Really. D Well, I guess that's what I know about benefits. Okay <laughter>? Good talking to you C and keep cool. Okay. ByeBye. Yeah, I agree on that. C And, D you know, it seems pa, compared to what we, our salary is versus what our health care is, our health care keeps increasing, increasing, increasing <sniffing> and not to the same rate as our pay <laughter>. <Breathing>. Right. Me either <sniffing>. Uhhuh. Yes. Right. Uhhuh, yeah. Money instead. Yeah. Right. I feel the same way, actually. F Um, we don't use any of T I s benefits other than I, I buy bonds and, <sniffing> and, F um, that's it C because, Not at all. My husband's, yes, we use my husband's. He, he works for Bramalea Company, C and they pay one hundred percent. Not one dime is deducted from his check. <Laughter> Bramalea. It's a security company C and, C and building, they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings. <Sniffing> C And, Yeah, actually they're from Canada. They're Canada based. Uhhuh. Right. Right, yeah, it's all taken care, D Yeah, but our prescriptions and everything, our visits to the doctor, our hospitalization, the only thing we pay for is if <sniffing>, if something happened, an emergency, and we had to have an ambulance, it's twentyfive dollars. E I mean that's nothing. <Sniffing>. Really, yeah, D well, T I was getting, for the both of us, it was D like seventyfive dollars a month. D You know, deducted for an H M O, <Laughter>. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, yeah. We don't either. Neither one of us do. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Exactly. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Exactly. You can't charge more for a person who's on a flight just because they're larger. Yeah. <Sniffing>. I don't know. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, they are as far as their D like pension plans, they're vested a lot earlier. I think at T I, it took five years. <Sniffing>. Five to seven. C And they're vested after their first year. To, totally vested. C And they have the four one K and the usual benefits like that, F uh. Right, right. No, they match the same amount. Yeah, D well, they match four percent which is the same, D You know, fifty percent or four percent. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. It's, Right. Yeah, that, C and I know that's a big issue C because I, I belong to a women's forum group. C And some of the questions we're getting are, are on site day care and things like that. That they consider a very serious benefit. C And I can't tell you anybody right now at T I that's, F uh, considering that. <Sniffing>. They should be though. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, a lot better. E D S is m, is better than Spring Creek? <Sniffing>. F Oh, man. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. People, yeah. <Sniffing>. F Oh, I see. Right. Yeah. That's good. That's a, that's a fortunate benefit, D you know, that they're so active for their employees. F Um, uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. <Sniffing>. Yeah. Me, too. Me, too, C because, D you know, with utilities and, and homes that are, F uh, price of homes have went up dr, drastically. D Like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand. C And that is unreal, because we've got people out here that are just poverty level. C But then we've got these million dollar homes C so D you know, where do you find a happy medium? C And how does your salary deal, with that? It's not. It's just not doing it. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. That's true. That is exactly where we are. It's so strange <sniffing>. Common problem. . <Laughter> Yeah, really. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Right, yeah, C and I think Dallas, as far as, F um, economic uncertainty, is better than what most of the country is. C So wer, somehow, we're better off than a lot of them. No <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Empowerment issues. <Sniffing>. Right. D Well, very well, F um, it's slow, though. At least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and, cultural change within the management first. C And now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level. C But, F uh, <sniffing> I think they're really trying. It's going to take years, though. E I mean it's just, it's that mindset, has to change, yeah. <Sniffing> Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't want to change. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, me, too. Go, good talking to you. Thanks. Okay. ByeBye.
