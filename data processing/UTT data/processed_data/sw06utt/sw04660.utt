<Talking> <<radio>> Okay. How do you get your news mostly? Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come. C So that's the first thing I want is the headlines. It's really funny because because, F uh, F uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines <laughter>. C But, F uh, C and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news. It's really weird. F Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long. C But, F uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news C and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper <laughter>. F Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though, C so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, D you know. C But, No. Uhhuh. Jus, I just have a channel that has music except for, D like every hour, D you know, say eight o'clock, nine o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news. C But as far as the actual news, I get that from <clicking> <<sounds like a call waiting>> from the, can you hold on just for a second? Just a minute. <<A answers the other line>> <<long pause>>. Hello sir <clicking>. <<A comes back to speaker B>> Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting <laughter>. F Uh, I was calling from work C so C and that was a call waiting. Yeah, yo, That's true too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, you're right. There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, D you know. C But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, D you know. Just, F uh, especially the weather. I like that <laughter>. Although they're usually wrong <laughter>. Uhhuh. C But, F uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty. F Uh, that seems like a long time for news C but that's how long it is. C And, F uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news. C And then, F uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come. C And, F uh, <Laughter>. Oh. Yeah, right. Once you get to work, I wouldn't either, huhuh. C But I've always been a morning person to get up, D you know. C An, C but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news C so <laughter>. I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock <laughter>. C But anyhow. D Well, listen, I guess that's about it then. It's been nice talking to you Tony. F Oh, really? F Oh, D well that hasn't happened to me yet. C So, you never know, it might this time. <Laughter> Okay, Tony. Uhhuh. Byebye. <Clicking> <talking>. <Breathing> Generally, I get most of my news from, F uh, the radio. C And then sometimes, F uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper C and just fall off on the articles that I like. F Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, F uh, <laughter> ju, having b, just being there I get, F uh, D you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V. How about you? Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Um. F Um. Okay. Do you get wh, D like one of the talk stations, the news stations? Sure. Right. Sure. Yes. Okay <laughter>. Right. S, it sounds like you, F uh, like the news a lot more than I do. Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it. C But, F uh, D you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news. C Or that's what comes on first. C And, F uh, D you know, also late at night, D you know, I don't wa, like watching the news late at night C but my wife is usually up then C and so I can't go to sleep with the T V on. I, F uh, C but, D you know, I, I wish I had, F uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine F uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction C and, F uh, there's, D you know, not that the news is science fiction, C but, F uh, F uh, I'm more interested in that. Things like, F uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. F Uh, D you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer C and, F uh, F uh, D you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me. Uhhuh. Yeah. Me, too. <Laughter> Yeah, Georgia here, they're usually wrong too. We have weird weather systems. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I'm D you know, I, I just, F uh, I would, I, I, I'm not a morning person C so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news. I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work C and then at work I have no time to read the news. No <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. Okay. Nice talking to you. I'll probably talk to you again. I had a friend who was in this C and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes. Yeah. That's right. Take it easy. Byebye <clicking>.
