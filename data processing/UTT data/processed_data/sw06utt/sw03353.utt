F Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn. Okay. <Laughter>. Wh, where do you go camping at around here? Okay. Sure. F Uh, what, F uh, what activities do you do when you're camping? Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds like fun. I, F uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills C and so we used to go camping, my dad would take us, there was, there was four of us kids, we'd, he'd take us, C and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids, C and it was always fun, F uh, C because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot C and, F uh, he'd always tell us, D you know, okay, look for, D you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents, C and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing, C and hopefully we'd catch our supper, C but we never did C but it was, it was always fun. We'd always, Mom was always prepared C and she'd bring along, D you know, something, because <laughter> tradition had it we would never catch anything, C so we always had, something along to eat, C but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows, C and it, it was always an enjoyable experience. F Uh, about nineteen eightytwo I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills, I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen, C and, F uh, there's no hills, it's flat, C and then I was in high school, C and, F uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing, C but by then, of course, I was able to catch, F uh, catch some things, C but, it, it was always fun. It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river D you know, in the hills we, we would do like you di, you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, D you know, and look for animals, C and we always, D you know, in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals, C but, Go ahead. Okay. Sure. D Now is there anything, F uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area. Okay. Uhhuh. I, <Laughter>. Right. Is the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose? Okay. Helps, helps keep the, the pests out, I suppose. D Well, that sounds, I don't know if I can rate camping, C but, D you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to <laughter>, to find a mountain, I guess. No, we just moved down in, in June. Yeah, I'm still trying to find my way around. I, if I can get on Central from anywhere, I'm happy. Okay. D Well, F um, I have gone to girls camp a few times, as a, D you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever C and, F uh, I enjoy camping. I, we ha, we have a tent, C and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, F um, I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death <laughter>. We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever. F Uh, we went camping at, F uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. F Um, we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April is when we went, C and, C and it got really cold at night, C and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning, C but, F Oh, we take little nature hikes C and, C and, F uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff. Usually try to have a, F uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, D you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all. Oh. F Um. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Uh, We used to live in Utah C and, F uh, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff. That's, that's a great place to go camping, C and the hiking is just really great. D You know, hike up those mountains is just really fantastic. F Um. I'm not acquainted with any, D you know, I, there's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area, D you know, there's a Tyler State Park that's, F uh, really a nice camping area, C but it, it's just a lot of trees, it's not, I don't know of any place in Texas that has, F uh, really big, D you know, what I call mountains <laughter>. The Rocky Mountains are so much, F uh, bigger than anything that they've they've got down here that, No, it's not, D well, it's not too bad. They have, F um, screened in areas, D you know, they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say, I guess they could call them that, but they're, they're more just a screened in, F uh, camping area whatever, they're, they're not bad. Yeah, <beep> yeah <beep>. Yeah, that's right. I, I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area. F Oh, I see. D Well, you're still, F uh, get, you're just trying to get over the culture shock still <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, D well, really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall. It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly, E I mean, there's, there's a lot,
