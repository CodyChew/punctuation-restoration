Okay, did they tell you our topic? Okay, it's, F uh, The topic is cars. What kind of car will you buy next C and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, D you know, pick that car out and, F uh, and why. Okay. Yeah, I'm the same way. I was, F uh, I had two Cadillacs. I went to my first Lincoln this last time. I travel C and, F uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company C so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln C so I finally tried one after fifty years C and, F uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars, C but I bought a Lincoln C and I like it. F Oh, are you? Uhhuh. D Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman. I travel on the road C so I like a little heavier car C but, D So that's why I choose, D you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car. C But, I tell you what, I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly. Yeah, because I like the Lincoln C but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better. I think so, too. Yeah, they really do. D You know, I'm a funny duck that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what, C but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. They always appear to hold well. Uhhuh. Did you. C And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is, a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car C and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln C and they're just not as large as before. I do miss that. D Well, you're right. Yeah, it's big, C but the trunk space for me, F uh, what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car C and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough. Yeah, D now, I have the Town Car C and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, F uh, the Cadillac. Uhhuh. F Oh, good. They went all the way down? D Well, that's good. That's good. Yeah, I sell sporting goods, F uh, hunting related items, I sell guns, gun cases and things like that C and I need to, D you know, that's about the same size as a golf club. They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that C and, Nope. Right. Yeah. I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville. I usually fly. I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me. We drove it ten hours to Nashville, C and it, it handled real well, C but, my main thing is space, C so if a Continental, I might consider it the next time, a Continental has more trunk space. You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs? Yeah, I like leather interiors also. Uhhuh. That's a nice car. You bet, C and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus, F Uh, no, somebody else answered the phone and put my number in. F Uh, what is the topic? Okay. F Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac. I've had, F uh, D well, I'm on my third one. C And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while. Uhhuh. My, My dad has been a, a, F uh, <lipsmack> Lincoln man for a lot of years, C but I've always been a G M man. I'm in the auto parts business myself. C And, F uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante. C And I just love it to death. I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it. I used to do that quite a bit myself. Yeah. Really? They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better. C And, D you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products C and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, F uh, imports is they put so much, D you know, gadgetry on the dash C and, C and the, the buttons are so small to push C and G M doesn't seem to do that. I kind of like that feature, C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I've, F uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty C and, F uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up. C And I had them do all four wheels. That's true, yeah. C But, what is big today. D You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been C but, You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental. D Well, the Town Car, I noticed, F uh, E or with the, with the Continental, F uh, I was, rented one, one time F uh, we could, F uh, put golf clubs in them. D You know, straight across. E I mean, Front to back. Not going from side to side. C And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage. I see. Yeah. Uhhuh. I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental. F Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car C because it's a V Six, C but it, F uh, I too, I drove it from here to Memphis C and I really enjoyed driving that car. If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy. You might take a look at them. They, they had a, a lot more trunk space. As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, F uh, Sedan De Ville had. F Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors, yeah. F Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather C and, F uh, then my eightysix was a touring sedan. C And, F uh, it had the gray leather package in it C and my Allante has, F uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.
