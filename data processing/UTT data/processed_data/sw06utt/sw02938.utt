All right. Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there? The, F uh, F Oh, you mean for D like smog and stuff? F Huh. Uhhuh. F Huh. What do you think of that, F uh, the greenhouse effect that's going on? Yeah that's causing the hole in the ozone. Uhhuh. It, it is scary though, isn't it? Right. D Well, all right, North Carolina. That's up there by Kentucky, isn't it? Uhhuh. Okay. Okay. D Well, Kentucky's next to Virginia, I'm pretty sure. D Well, I'm from Kentucky, I should know but, I don't, I'm sorry. C But Kentucky, we use to have severe, E I mean, just real cold, cold winters C and we'd have three and four feet of snow. Course here in Texas they don't have snow, they don't know what snow is. They freak out when there's snow on the ground <laughter>. F Oh, Amarillo? D Well that's close to here. How long have you been in Raleigh? D Well, how old are you? Okay. D Well, we're the same age. Yeah, I forget my age all the time, C so that's okay. It's, I think it's just something that goes with the territory. C But to me, Texas, D see and Kentucky, we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school. Okay? In Texas, A I'm serious, if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain, I, I swear they close everything down. I just laugh. E I mean, I do, they get, E I mean, C and traffic slows down to nothing. F Oh, D well, no northe, I'm from the north, that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we, I don't know, you just get used to the weather, C and of course the people down in south, they don, they're not used to cold weather and stuff, C and, F uh, it just, I don't know, I just laugh every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground everything's closed up. C And D you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road <laughter>. C But, F uh, No, not really, E I mean, not to see it. D Now of course, there's, D you know, T I is here, Oscar Mayer C and there is a few factories, C but I don't see much pollution going on. Uhhuh. D Well, see, they have that, F um, A what is it a test, or something like that they call it. C And, F uh, that's supposed to cut down on it. Yeah, school buses and the commercial buses, yeah. D Well, they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is. C And, F uh, it, it gets bad. Uhhuh. D Well, that's a good idea. D Well, F uh, the, D you know, pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes. When I was pregnant with my first little boy, I had read it, C because back then C because I was walking back and forth, toc, D well not back and forth, I was walking home from, F uh, the college I was going to in Kentucky. C And I was having to walk along the highway. It was just one day a week. C But it was, in, I, I have no sense of smell, C so I couldn't smell this, C but it would make me sick, C and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway. C But, yeah, it's, yeah, all the exhaust. F Uh, D well, that was four years ago, too, it's probably a lot worse now. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do you, F uh, smoke? W, yeah, it's kind of l, Yeah, because you do smoke one a day. F Um. F Uh, For the air pollution. F Huh. C But, they, I don't hear much about it down here. Course, Texas, we don't have a bunch of c, pollution. C But, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast. C And D you know it'd blow it up north. C So, maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here. C But, no it would seem like it would be the same way in, on the California coastline, wouldn't it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially. I think they do that for most everybody. I, especially, it's usually for the young children and the older, the old people older old people. It is? <Laughter>. Oh. F Oh, D well, this is pretty wooded area down here C so, l, in a lot of parts, yeah. I know Texas is supposed to be flat, C but they've got, D you know, down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of, F uh, They do? <Laughter> They live close then. In Durant, Oklahoma? You go where? F Uh, you go to visit them? Oh. Yeah, D well, down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area. This, C but, C but Kentucky's beautiful. They've got trees, C and trees are supposed to, D you know, purify. You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff? It's a philodendron. It's supposed to filter the air for you, in your home. I had one. My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months, four months ago. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I did. I couldn't make myself quit. I did cut down a lot <laughter>. I got, I, I've got one vice C and smoke is, smoking is it. I don't, I don't drink, C and I try not to cuss, C and I do, I do very little, and smoking, I just, I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen. Yeah, we're down here at the Bible belt, aren't we? F Uh, I wasn't saved until I got down here, C and people down here are just, there's so many Christians, C and it's so different from Kentucky C but, F Um, I worked at T I for a while, C but then my brotherinlaw works there, C and he got me into it. How'd you get into it? D Well, it's fun, I like talking to new people. C And I, half the time, D well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl, I've had to hang up and stuff. C But I enjoy it. I talked to people from, D well, C, what, Carolina now up in, F uh, Boston, and New York, D well Boston is New York, isn't it? No. Boston, Massachusetts <laughter>. C But I've talked to people in New York, C but I've talked to a lot of people in Texas, because I guess, it's because T I s down here. With Boston, I love their accent <laughter>. I do, I love the Boston acc, accent. I met a girl from Boston one time. My husband was in the service, C so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas, C and his family's down here. We're out of the service now. Yeah, he got out of it, his unit, right after Panama. We went to Pana, he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that. C And, F uh, he... F Um, we've got quite a few, D actually. What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city. F Um, we've actually had some warnings in, F uh, Raleigh F uh, on air pollution. Uhhuh, because of there so many cars, C and we have a belt line alo, around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic. C And, F um, D you know, i, it's still, it's just surrounding the city, C and you can actually see it. There's a couple of, F uh, tall buildings in Raleigh, C and, C and you can actually, D you know, they're blurred, they're even dark, C and what it is is the pollution. D Well I guess that's fluoro, the fluorocarbons and, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, that's very serious. E I mean, we can, we're even feeling the effects of the weather from, F uh, F uh, the shift in the jet stream. F Oh yeah. E I mean, F uh, the last two, F uh, years, our winters have been absolutely nothing. E I mean, maybe, one snow. Kentucky? F Uh, North Carolina is all the way on the east coast. It's further west than Georgia, it's, F uh, right below Virginia. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <laughter> Originally I'm from Texas C so, E I mean Amarillo. C So, F uh, Uhhuh. Yeah, real close. F Um, I've been out of Texas about ten years. F Oh, twenty, F uh, seven. I almost forgot my age. F Oh, really? F Um <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Actually, they've been doing the same thing here. It's, D you know, it's kind of funny, they, F um, I guess northerners are different, C but even, F uh, North Carolinians, they don't know how to handle cold weather. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter> That's true. Do you all have much pollution there? Uhhuh. D Well, D you know, what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road, C and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe. Uhhuh. D Well, supposedly that's supposed to catch it. C But I'll tell you what, C and even these buses, F oh lord, it real bad. These buses in Raleigh, F Oh, yeah. E I mean, school buses are notorious. F Oh, yeah, yeah. D Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top, C and that way it gets above, F um, other cars on the road C and, F uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, D you know, even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles, C and, C and, D you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable. I would, I'd have to go out to the country to jog. No, I didn't know that. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. Golly, that's, that's bad. F Oh, I'm sure. D Well, they, F um, you can really feel it, D you know, in your breathing, even normal people, C and if you're older, F um, E I mean, you can really deplete your oxygen, C and it'll, D you know, pass out, C and it's, D you know, it's killed several people. F Um, D actually, I'm a very, I just smoke one in the evening if that. C So, I'm a very, very light smoker. It was kind of funny. They were doing some, F uh, ozone testing, and, F uh, th, the E P A C and they were just screening some candidates, C and I don't think I'd ever, D you know, do that, C but they, F uh, asked me if I was a smoker, C and I didn't fit into the smoker's category, C and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category. F Um, it was, D you know, I was just one of those yeah, in between people. C So that kind of threw them off. C But they're doing a lot of research here, F uh, the E P A For ozone, and A F oh, yeah, all that. They're, they're real big into it. They've got Research Triangle Park here, C and they're, D you know, they're just doing a lot of, F uh, lot of stuff. Huhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there. E I mean, I can't believe they have warnings here, which it, it's mainly just when it gets real, real hot. Really? D W, D well that's kind of good to know, C because I thought lord, I thought I lived in a halfway decent area. F Um. Uhhuh. D Well you ought to come to North Carolina. It's a big change <laughter>. Yeah. There was no trees where I was from, in Amarillo, C and here they've got the mountains, the beach, the trees, D you know, it's they've got streams, rivers, ponds, it's really pretty here. Is it? Uhhuh. Sherman and Denison, do you know my grandparents live in Durant? Yeah. Yeah, real close. I go there, Yeah. F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah, we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma. Huh, huhuh. F Oh, really? D Well, I'm going to have to get some. Uhhuh. Do you smoke? Do you? Did you smoke when you, when you were pregnant? D Well. E I mean I can understand that, D actually. <Laughter> D Well, Yeah. D Well, one thing I miss is, F uh, is the people from Texas, are, are, D you know, I miss their morals, their values and everything. It's, F uh, Uhhuh. How'd you get involved in this research? F Oh, I see. F Huh. F Um, I, I was taking a voice I O class and, F um, and actually doing some research, C and so they told me about this project. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, no, Boston's above. Uhhuh. Yeah, I've talked to a lot of people in Texas. I had one call f, actually from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Virginia, and, F um, I can't remember where all. From up north, like you said, I think one was from Boston. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I bet you're glad. Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh.
