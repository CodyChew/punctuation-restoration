Okay, Cindy, you there? Okay, what kind of dinner parties have you had? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Whatever you like, F huh? Yeah. Uhhuh. F Um. F Oh, that sounds delicious. Yeah. Yeah. D You know, I've made D like little Swedish meatballs, C but they're just made out of the beef, D you know. And, F uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick. Uhhuh. F Um. Yeah, that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time. D You know, I've, F uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, F uh, which I had things like that, C but I always cooked them ahead of time C and then I just sliced them. D You know, and had macaroni salad with, F uh, shrimp in it. Have you ever had that? Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp C and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make. The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor. Yeah, I don't like the can, but the fresh. D You know. Yeah, that was really good. Yeah, right, right. C But, F uh, at, F uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, D you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people C and then by time you pass everything around, it seems like everything on your plate's cold. <Laughter>. C So, C But anyhow, I, Yeah, you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, D you know. C But, F uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties. F Uh, D you know, I have, D like, maybe just a cou, another couple over for dinner. C But, F uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, D you know a whole bunch of people D like except, except at Christmas C and I have my family. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah, that's easy. I always like to have that, too. Yeah. Everybody seems to like that, too. No, everybody likes that. C And, then, F uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, D you know. Especially if a pork roast. That's what I love, with my d, <Laughter>. C And, F uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what g, next weekend when the Super Bowl's on I've asked a couple people to come over C and I just, F uh, had been thinking what to have for that <laughter>. No not yet <laughter>. No, C and I, D you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V. I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V. D You know, D so, I'll think of something, just th, that we can munch on over there, D you know. C And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Preparing it, right. F Oh, it sure does. D Well, when I was brought up, D you know, we didn't, Yeah. D Well, I've had them, F uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people. F Uh, C and I had help with them. F Uh, C and part of them I did were D like a buffet C and, F uh, it, I had, F uh, just different, F uh, side dishes and appetizers C and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, F uh, some, F uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres C and, F uh, anyhow, F uh, you take, F uh, a couple of, F uh, cups of Bisquick and, F uh, sausage, F oh, like a, a Owens mild, you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to. Yeah. C And, F uh, you put that in C and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy C and then, D like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes C and they are so good. Yeah. It's making me hungry for them <Laughter> right now. Have you? Yeah. Uhhuh. I, I've used that quite a bit C and it, C and it seems to work real well. F Uh, C And, F uh, F uh, when I've had so many people, F uh, t, to feed, D like I try to do a ham and a turkey C and C and, Yeah. Uhhuh. No. What, Uhhuh. F Oh, I'll bet. Yeah. I'll have to try that. I like things that are easy and, and, F uh, nutritious. Uhhuh. I know. I know <laughter>. D Well, Thank God for microwaves, D you know. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, D well I don't anymore. Y, it's been a few years C and, C and, F uh, I don't have, D you know, over a couple either C and C and, F uh, I try to, F uh, have everything all ready C and, C and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't s, spend all my time in the kitchen. And, F uh, Spaghetti C and, Yeah. I know, I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I like it, too. I do, too. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, have you had any good ideas yet? F Oh, <laughter> okay. Yeah. Yeah. C And that's the way to do it, too. I think it's, D you know what's I think is so nice is that <breathing> in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you C and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen. C And, C And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it? D Well,
