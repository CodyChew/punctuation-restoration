Okay. What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day? <Laughter>. Yeah, that's right. That is really an invasion of privacy. I, I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly, the solicitors, and the carpet cleaning companies and, Does that happen in your part of the country? I, F uh, I come home C and I am trying to get a few things done C and I can't do anything but answer the telephone. Some evenings are worse than others, C but I wish I could put a stop to it, C but I don't know what to do to stop it. Uhhuh. They would think it didn't mean them, I guess. Everybody but me <laughter>. F Oh, goodness. Are you stil, do you live at home with your parents? Uhhuh. C So your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family. <Laughter>. D Now what can you do to stop that? <Laughter>. No. Just have to live with it, I guess. Try to remember to respect their privacy, C and maybe they will respect yours C and, <Laughter>. Do you have brothers? F Oh, okay, I was ra, I had two younger brothers, C and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations C and, <Laughter>. I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me, C and then they would go get on the other extension C and I could hear them, C but I couldn't get them to hang up, D you know. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Even it, in the office I, F uh, find that people walk up and, and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy, they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you <laughter> hang up. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. Let's see, I can't think of anything else I'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors. About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door. Uhhuh. C And I guess that's really th, the thing that really bugs me the most. I can't think, tha, our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me, C but they've all gotten grown up now C and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me, since mine are all grown up, C but. What else would be an annoyance? D Well, I guess traffic could be an annoyance. Do you have a lot of traffic in your area? Uhhuh. Some days it's real, real bad here, C and you would like to, <laughter> feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you, D you know. C But, It really is, and pretty noisy. It really is. I live right on a main thoroughfare, C so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy C because it, at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night D you know, when you go to bed. C And every time a, a fire truck or anything went down the road, I would wake up, C but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore. C And, F uh, I just close it out, I guess, because I don't, I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, D you know. I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me <laughter>. <Laughter> They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess. <laughter>. <Laughter> Let's see. What else is an invasion? Oh. D Well, did you have has name all over them? <Laughter>. That was yours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Um, F huh. D Well, I don't like it when, F uh, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room <laughter>, or when people D like look through my things in my bedroom <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Definitely. Right <laughter>. Right. Even, F uh, we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting, C and they would still come to our door and knock and <laughter>, I guess not, no. Yeah <laughter>. Yes. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, mostly. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, I don't know. D Well, I am used to it now, C but <laughter> sometimes it sort of gets, gets to me C but <swallowing> there is not much I can really do. No. Yeah. D Well, I don't know <laughter>. I always, F Uh, no, yes, I do, C but they don't live at home. F Oh, I used to do that though <laughter> because I was the youngest, I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs <laughter>. C But I, Oh. Yeah <laughter>. C But I stopped doing that a long time ago, C and they still do it to me. F Oh, D like, s, yeah, this lady does that to me at work <laughter> when I'm taking an order or something, C and she'll just sit there and listen <laughter> like I'm doing something wrong, C and she just started C and, she is nice C but. <<Speaking to someone in the background>> Okay. C But, D you know, <laughter> it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do. C But, I, No <laughter>. Right. D Well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls, D you know, C so. C But, F Uh, Oh <laughter>. F Oh, yeah. Especially when you're in a hurry <laughter>. F Um, it can get busy, yeah. Usually in the week I'm. Yeah, uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah, I've traveled quiet a bit, C and I've been through Dallas, Texas. It's pretty busy <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah, I suppose you do. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I am a real solid sleeper though <laughter> C so that probably wouldn't bother me. I'd sleep right through it <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. It takes a lot. I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time <laughter>. I was mad because those were mine, No <laughter>. It was a, a letter from a girlfriend of mine. I, I just, I was upset because those were mine, C and, D you know, I thought he, Right. I thought he would respect me more than that, to look through my things and not trust me, C so that was upsetting. I was mad about that and my privacy there.
