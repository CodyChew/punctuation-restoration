Hi Ed. Hi. F Oh. Who wrote that? F Huh. I see. D Well, that is interesting. Right. That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that. Uhhuh. C And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Uh. Explained, Supposedly scooped up by the triangle. Yeah. Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, D you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her? I, I think that would be, I am sure there is something out there, F uh,, I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years. D Well whatever, this is one aspect of it. Of course, D you know, it is so weird, C cause no one will ever really know, it's, it, tha, C so C but it's entertaining C and it makes you think about things. That is for sure. Yeah. Right. D Well, I, I guess I just have not read anyth, E I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, D you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good, C and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's C and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT. C And I just really, really liked the way he writes. It's just, incredible. Yeah. F Uh. That was good, I think. C And, C and the other book I am trying to think, D you know, D like was in the last year C and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, F uh, BON yeah. F Uh. Yeah I, that was really, really good, the movie was nothing compared to the book. C And. Yeah. F Oh, the movie was a joke <laughter> compared to, E I mean, C because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, D you know, pinpointing, F uh, so, so, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things C and, C and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie <laughter>. C And, D anyway, we are not talking about that, C but, F uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what <laughter> to do with my garden C and, F uh, C And, F uh, Yeah. D Like, what is a book on your list, D you know I have a list too C and I have never gotten to it <laughter>. Oh. Hi. F Uh, books, I've, actually I am reading a couple of different books, <sigh> F uh, one wa, is, F uh, a story, D well it is not a story, it is a collection of, F uh, of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes, F uh, that was, F uh, that was, it came out a couple of years ago C and I have just now gotten around to reading it. I have had it a couple years, C but, F uh, jus, jus, <sigh>, F Oh, I do not remember the man's name, he was, used to be a reporter for, F uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two, C and he supposedly got this, this, s, story, F uh, E I mean this, F uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell, C and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, F uh, corporate headquarters in, F uh, in Los Angeles. They, on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles, they used to have a, E or, I guess they still do, F uh, had a, F uh, F uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices C and it was sort of nondescript for a, F uh, D you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected, he, he was, F uh, a great collector of everything, he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away C and, F uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for awhi, he was a, D like, D you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, F uh, And had ended up, he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect, C and they, F uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, F uh, supposedly from, from Hughes to, F uh, to his main, F uh, main a, assistant back, F uh, in the fifties and si, F well, I guess, in the sixties, up until his death. D So, it's pretty interesting work C so, Yeah, it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard you have to plod through it C and, D you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot, you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on. No, I have not seen it. C But it's, C but it is, it is real interesting, F uh, I also reading, F uh, the, F uh, thi, it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have. I am sort of rereading it. It's, F uh, a book about, F uh, the Bermuda Triangle, C but it's, F uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, F uh, wrote who was, F uh, a research librarian, he wrote, F uh, sort of <sigh> debunking many of the, F uh, F uh, the stories about the, F uh, Bermuda Triangle. D You know, he, he was thinking many, many of the <sigh> the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, F uh, actually, <sigh> could be explained, C and, D you know. F Uh, C and the rea, reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, F uh, D Well when they found the, F uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen. C And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all C but it's, F uh, Flight Nineteen was one of the, F uh, <sigh> was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two, C and they were, <sigh> they were lost C and, F uh, Yeah, they were. C And so, C and in the book, D you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, C and even, C and even then he, <sigh> he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. C And, F uh, C because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth. C And, F uh, it's probably, D you know, real close to what, D you know, everyone is thinking, now that, <sigh> they just got turned around and could not find their way back. F Uh, no, I have not. Yeah, I would I would like to, too, C because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, D you know, possibilities of he, of where she, F Uh <sigh>. Yeah. Right. Yeah. D So, that is pretty much for right now, that is, what I have been reading. I kind of like to read different stuff C and, F uh, I like to read a novel every now and then, C but, F uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I read that, too. I got it, F uh, right, after it came out. My, F uh, D you know, he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, F uh, and while he was writing the book, C and, F uh, my sisterinlaw lives in Chicago, C and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this, this guy is, D you know, from here. C And, F uh, I read it and really liked it C and then about, that is when it really got big. C And, F uh, so I, . BONFIRE OF THE VANITY, I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good. Yeah, that is what I have heard. I saw the movie, C and, F uh, Yeah. Right. Right. I know. Yeah. I have a lot of, F uh, F uh, computer books that I am, I do computer work C and so I have a lot of those. C So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them. C But I, I'm interested in a lot of that, C but, F uh, I have got a lot of books that I, I intend to read, C but I have not been able to yet, D you know, for one reason or another. <Sigh> F Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list, C cause I just kind of, F uh, I just have all the books out, D you know, I have book shelves C and I have them all out C and usually when I am through with one, I will go in <sigh> and, F uh, F uh, F uh, look, look through, F uh, I have one now A C and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is the sisterinlaw in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book C and, F uh, F uh, sh, I have one C and I can not remember the name of it, F uh, it is supposed to be a mystery.
