Okay. <Laughter> F Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading? Oh. Right, I've read that one too. I only had a subscription once, C but my mother always gave me hers C and I, I really enjoyed, D you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, I have an interest in art, C so I, frequently purchase and read, F uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment. C And, F uh, F oh, I guess I like a variety of things, F uh, lots of fiction, F uh, type books. F Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, F uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history. That's fairly interesting. Yeah, I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement. How about you? <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, D well, F uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement. E I mean they are C but I don't label it as such. D Well, I don't know, F um, I, F uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, F uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things, C but, F uh, they would be things on D like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. D You know ge, getting your, yourself in gear to, F uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it. Yes. Sure. F Um. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter> I don't know, I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King. That's a little, little heavy for me. Yeah. D Well I guess I also have been reading, F uh, a lot of things on, F uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work. F Oh, yeah, you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other C but, F uh, I think sometimes the word is a little over used C but, Yeah. Okay, D well, any other comments. D Well we just started, right. D Well you too, C and F uh, goodbye. Goodbye. Wonderful touch tone telephone there. F Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies, therefore, my, my reading pleasures are quite wide. F Um, I get a charge out of, F uh, TEXAS HIGHWAY, which is, F uh, very colorful, and, F uh, not being a native of Texas, but being here eleven years have a tendency to, F uh, find out the, F uh, about the different areas of the co, of the, of the state by reading it. F Oh yeah, it's, it's, F uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, F uh, set up little trips and day trips and things. It's pretty, pretty neat. <talking> <<background>> F Um, F oh, I like photography, F um, magazines. I don't take a subscription or anything like that. F Um, things, F oh, being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, F uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines C and, C and, F uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, F uh, see, F uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house C and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, F uh, D you know, to keep active on it, C but, F uh. How about yourself? F Oh, that's great. Uhhuh. I bet that would be, rather interesting. F Uh, that's, F uh, self improvement, that's, that's alwa, D well, that's kind of a hobby C but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, F uh. F Um, D well I hate to, yes, I do <laughter>. We, F uh, we have these classes we attend, F uh, management classes C and, C and they give you books C and, C and the last book, F uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht. It talks about, F uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, F uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments. F Uh, one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is. F Uh, C so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is C and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer. Your my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing. F Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, F uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, F uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, F uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all, D you know, betters yourself. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Like what for example. Sure. Sure. How about items like, F um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big, okay. C So those are self improvements. F Um, our supervisor, F uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L <<spells it out>> C and it's a very layman's, F uh, F uh, approach towards managing different types of people. C And the very last chapter, A C and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers <laughter>. C So it's, it's ver, it's interesting, here again it's, it's casual reading C and it's not eaten up with a lot of, F uh, mechanical stuff C and it's really excellent fast reading C and, F uh, C but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, D you know, I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are selfimprovements, I would probably be turned off to them. If he casually just walked into it and, F uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested. Yeah, they're, F uh, quite, F uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting C and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies, C but, F uh, it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them. I have a hard time finishing books. Uhhuh. In quality, especially now days, F uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways. Exactly, exactly right. Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying. I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk C and, C and all that kind of rolls in together there, C but, F uh, that's just kind of part of it. F Uh, not that I can think of. F Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit. I need to probably make a phone call or two <laughter>. F Uh, this is true. I've enjoyed it. Have a good day. Byebye <talking>.
