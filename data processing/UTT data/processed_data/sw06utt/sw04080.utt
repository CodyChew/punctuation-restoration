Okay. What's your view. What's your view? Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, that's true. D You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, D you know, I don't know. Coming from Texas you're probably, I don't know I shouldn't make stereo types, C but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think. F Oh, you're just live down there? Yeah. F Oh D well. <laughter>. Yeah, D well I know how you feel. I'm, F uh, I grew up in Nebraska C and, C and we always use to go out and hunt all the time, D you know C and man, there's no way. <laughter> There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons. That's just, I don't know. Yeah. It doesn't sit with me very well. <laughter> I don't know, I, anymore I keep a thirtyeight in my truck, D you know. Yeah, I just about all, D well I live in Minneapolis C and <children_talking> I, D well D actually I live in Florida, C but I am staying <children_talking> in Minneapolis for a year C and D you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now C and it's just, you never know who is out there. D You know it's just for self protection purposes C and then of course there's the hunting issue, C so yeah that's good. What do you do, Jeff? F Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah. I'm, F uh, researcher of Honeywell up here. D So, F uh, yeah. You guys <child_talking>, F uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything C or, Yeah. D You know that's something I miss quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, my brother was, F uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while <child_talking> and, F uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit, C but I don't know. I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, F uh, for a complete, That's right. I guess I am about eight or nine <laughter>. Yeah, no doubt about it C but, F uh, <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, if there's if there's a way, D you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know <childtalking> that they, I guess they passed a couple of, F uh, F uh, laws a here while back <child_talking> in some states in terms of a <child_talking> waiting period where D you know you go to buy a hand gun C and then they actually, F uh, I know it's this way in Florida. They have a waiting period where you buy one C and that's a week C and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record D you know and things like that. I think that's a pretty good idea. F Uh, C and that's, I don't know, that's not a bad idea, C but then again you can always get around that. You could go through the black market like you say. D You know, you always be able to get around C but, F uh, Yeah, it's one of things C but, F uh, I don't know. I guess, I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon. Yeah, I'm just not, I think those have been pretty much, D you know, banned altogether anyway. There, It kind of takes the sport out of hunting <laughter>. D You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve. D You know, you might do the same thing. C And so it's like, I don't know. It does. It takes the sport out of it. For me I would much rather have a bow anytime <laughter>. I, I like bows. D You know, I have done some bow hunting C and I, F uh, I get into it C and I think it's more of a challenge, D you know. C But, F uh, I don't know. I guess it keeps the shell makers in business. C But, F uh, I don't know. D Anyway, that's about where I stand <laughter>. You, F uh, C And you, F uh, have you eaten yet or whatever. Is it seven o'clock there? You guys central? F Oh, it's not too good. It's kind of rainy D actually. Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, F uh, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees C and it's been up around forty. C So people are, people are whining about the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature. Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that C so. I am just up here for the year C and it's kind of shocking. All right. F Huh? <Throat_clearing> D Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally. E I mean, That's right. That's right. Yeah. It is, C but I'm not really from <laughter> I'm not really from Texas, I just live down here now. I've I've lived down here a couple years. I'm originally from Colorado, C but yeah there, F uh, there, F uh there's a lot of hunters here. Uhhuh. I just think, I think it's ridiculous. E I mean, Really. Uhhuh. Right. Right. Sure. F Uh, I, I'm in, F uh, program control for a company up here. Yeah. We do schedules, for programs, schedule programs. What do you do? F Oh, okay. F Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here. I don't own a shotgun, C but I'd like to go bird hunting. D So. Yeah, F uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you, D you know, quite a bit C but, One for a total ban and, F uh, Yeah, I, I agree with you there <child_crying>. E I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't I, D you know, I'm not for it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing> Sure. Yeah, I don't either <sneezing>. Yeah, I fully auto, C but, even D well, E I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's, Yeah. Right. Sure. Right. F Oh, really. Yeah. Sure. Me too. Yeah, I am about the same way. Yeah. F Uh, yeah, it's about seven fifteen. How is the weather up there? Is it? Right. Yeah.
