D Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are, that are an invasion of your privacy? Oh. Right. Yeah, I think that's, that's the only thing I wrote down also, C because that's just a, it's terrible today, E I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes. Yes, I know, that's true. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's true. C But, D you know, people, it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, E I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day, C and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance D you know, to the small business man C and, F uh, D you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also, as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York, C and, F uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or stock investments or whatever. C And now I'm getting the same calls at ho, at the house. C And they get your, C and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet, C and, F uh, credit card companies, they sell your name. D I know. Yes. American Express does that, by the way. Yeah, I understand they sell it, D you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them. C And that is an invasion of privacy, you're right. I know, that's true. Exactly, magazine companies, F uh, F uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money. C But, it's, F uh, D you know, I guess, it, F uh, you have to be a certain income holder to, F uh, have an American Express card, C so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling. D So, I don't know. What, what do you, where are you from? F Oh, okay, D well C so, yeah, we live in the Dallas area, Richardson. Okay <laughter>. Did you? Yeah, I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York C and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning C and I'll get people D you know, from out of the, F uh, out of the state. <Laughter>. I'll be darned. Where you from? Not from Texas. New Jersey, right. Yeah. My wife's from New Jersey. Yeah, from, F uh, Saddle River. She, Okay. D Well, that's nice, too. Really, yes, my wife's been away for twentyfive years, C so she's been away for quite a while. Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas, C and her mother was from New York, C so they just they over there in New Jersey. F Uh, C and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy, C but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling. I know. That's a, that's a good suggestion. I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings. Right. Sure. <Laughter>. Yeah, you're probably right. <Laughter>. I understand. E I mean, I, it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations C and, I know, they call you one time to send three kids to the car, carnival or circus C and, Right. There's always a dif, C and I, my, my pat answer now is, D well, you just called me the other night, D Well, the, F uh, what I really, I don't like is the ca, the constant calls, people selling things people telling me I want things. D You know, <breathing> people trying to solicit for different, D you know, organizations. D You know, that's what I really. Never stops ringing, right. That's right. D Well, D you know, the, the great, F uh, thing for that, it's, F uh, is, is an answering machine <laughter>. E I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, D you know, you just switch that thing on, C and, F uh, <laughter>. Yeah. F Um, even in an office? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh, I know. F Oh, yeah, F uh, D well, D you know, these people, they sell your names, D I mean D you know, I, that's also an invasion of privacy. I think it the whole thing is, F uh, F Oh, they do? D Well, sure it is. That's right. D Well, D you know, if you've ever gotten anything, D you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere <laughter>. E I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever. Uhhuh. That's right. Yeah, that's right. F Oh, I'm from Texas. F Oh, we're in Plano. <Laughter> D Well, D you know, the only call I really got that, D well, was out of state, I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California. C And that was, F uh, California, I was thrilled to death, because that's, D you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, D you know, C and, F um, F Oh, really. Oh. Yeah, D see, D well that's, F uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, F uh, that was the one from California. I don't know why I ask people on the weekends <laughter>, from out of state, C or, F uh, I don't know, D you know, C but, F Uh, originally from New Jersey. Yeah. F Oh, really, what part? F Oh, that's nice over there. Yeah, we're from more, F uh, from sort of towards the shore, central New Jersey, D you know, we're like, F uh, Yeah, F oh yeah, it was beautiful, that's why I, I really miss it. I, I don't really like it here at all <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, C so they, Yeah <laughter>. D Well, yeah, E I mean, yeah, yeah, C and, then, of course they call, D you know, before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous D you know, I said, this is absurd, I, D you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing. F Oh, it's great, E I mean. D Well, D you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard, C because I, I always have it on D you know, C and I'll get that, that message that says, F uh, to, F uh, F um, D you know, F uh, end this call, press three <Laughter> C and I assumed I, D you know, it was from the switchboard. D You know <laughter>. Yeah it is, because one day I listened, D you know, and it was <laughter>, D you know, C but, F um, I, I just got totally disgusted, C and then, D you know, people asking for, for money for everything, D you know, E I mean. Exactly, and, D you know, the policeman's associations. F Oh, I used to do that. Yeah, I used to do that, I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something <laughter>.
