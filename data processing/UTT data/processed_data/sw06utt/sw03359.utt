F Oh, I guess, F uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater, <Laughter> D Well, I'm not, F uh, I, there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really, C and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, F uh, F uh, especially like good prime rib C so if it's, F uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that, C and I live here in, F uh, Rome, New York, C and there are a lot of good restaurants around here. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really. F Oh, no, I'm in upstate New York, C and it's actually very inexpensive, I, there's a there's a place, F um, half a mile from me here that, F uh, has, F uh, fantastic prime rib for, F oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, D you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards, C so that, Right. F Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had, C so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas. Uhhuh, sure. Uhhuh. No, no, I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that, C but I do D like, F uh, D like a seafood bar, D like a raw, raw bar D like oysters and things like that, F uh that they, F uh, I go on, I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business C so I, F uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, F uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit C but, I love that, Yeah, C and, F um, C and, F uh, Maryland's great, you get the crabs it's like, I can't go anywhere where I <laughter> where I don't enjoy myself, C so, That's true. Yeah, D well, F uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, F uh, F uh, I, say that, F uh, the oceans have the greatest re, resource of food on the planet, C and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically <Laughter> C so, we managed to, F uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, F uh, but not, F uh, not seafood. Yeah, yeah, I like, F uh, I make a, a wicked chili C and around here the big spicy thing is D like, F uh, buffalo wings C and so, F uh, it, people, they, D you know, you go out to get the chicken wings C and those are really hot and the hotter the better, <Laughter>. Right. Sure. Yeah. Uhhuh. My, generally my, my scalp will start, I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, <Laughter> the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling, C but, F uh, I don't know, C but, F uh, yeah, D well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like. Things that are kind of oddball, like, F uh, Thai cuisine, I never been really fond of that stuff. You talk about spicy, that'll, that'll literally blow your head off, it's so hot. C And, F uh, C and I can handle just about any kind of food without, F uh, F um, D well, C but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, F uh, my tolerances, C So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, F uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too that's one thing, What's that? Yeah, D Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, D you know, working waitressing jobs C or waiter, <Laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, I, I try to be as well, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, you're in New York, I was going to, there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib. It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt C and it is absolutely wonderful. C And, F uh, we were there a few months ago, C and it, E I mean, it's kind of pricey, D well, from New York it probably doesn't matter, C but <laughter>. F Oh, is it, okay. Wow. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen, C and it includes, D you know, salad and rolls and, F oh, some other stuff, C but it is absolutely wonderful. It's the best I have ever had. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, Yeah, D well, we like, F uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food C so, F um, that's, I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites. C But, F um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah fresh seafood down there, Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, seafood seems to be a lit, a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food. C But it sure is good, C and it's supposed to be good for you. Right. Right. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Do you like spicy foods C or, F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, we, F uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, F uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it C and, F uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that <laughter>. C But I like it hot, C but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, C and the price. C And the price. Make you want to come back.
