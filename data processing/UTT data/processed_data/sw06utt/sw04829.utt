Okay <static>. F Uh, <breathing> let me see. Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling. We don't, we don't do enough. I know we don't so <noise>. F Uh, although lately I've been, F uh, a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit C and it's, it's, it's, F uh, <laughter> interesting to watch some of the things that she does C and then she's almost had an impact on me, F uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes <noise> to my house C but I can kind of tell it bothers her C so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, F uh, F uh, paper plates and paper cups C and I don't do that anymore. I don't know why, I just don't <laughter>. I just, just from socializing with her C so. It really, it, there's not a whole lot, there really isn't. F Uh, <child_talking> I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has, they're, they're given three baskets C and they put them out on a certain day of the week C and each, F uh, home does participate C but we really don't have anything, F uh, close in this area that, that do anything. C And, C and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense. <Child_talking>. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah. That's another thing. You have to <child_talking> go to different places to do that. Uhhuh. C But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, F uh, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good, that's good. Uhhuh. F Huh. No. F Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. <Barking>. Uhhuh. D Well, that's good. I, I'm, D you know, unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't, they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that <barking> C or I, D you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, F uh, garbage collection C and they haven't, D you know, talked about doing something like that <barking>. She lives in Garland C and I'm not sure where, what she does. C But she's, F uh, oh she's ve, very heavy in that C and she takes her own bags to the grocery store <child_talking>. F Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products <laughter> in her house. F Uh, C and just a lot of things I've <laughter> learned off of her that, to start doing. C And she does make a lot of sense. Just her whole house is <laughter> like wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C And, F uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat. I sat and watched him. You know the Barney? You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney. They had one, F uh, on that kind of, type of thing C and how children can, can do that and C how to save water b, when you brush your teeth in water C and it's really caught on C and he's only four C and he's really caught on. <Laughter>. And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing. He's really caught on C so that's really neat <static> <child_talking>. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. How do you, how, F uh, is recycling done in your community? Is, Uhhuh. Right. Oh. Right. Over here, they, F uh, have several private companies that you can take, F uh, recycled, materials to. C But, F uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, F uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off. That's what I do. F Uh, C and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, F uh, newspapers. D So it's nice to have, D you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place C and, Right. Right. D So it's, D so that's nice. It would be, it would be really nice if they, F uh, came to the house to pick it up C and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that, C but, F uh, F uh, it didn't go through. Right. I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, F uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, D you know. F Uh, C so I guess that's one option. I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too. D Like, F uh have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is? Yeah, I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle, you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler. Yeah. C So now they're D like marking, F uh, they're, I don't know, there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics C and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is. C So I guess that makes it easy to recycle C and then they're, they're, F uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, D you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic D so that that makes it easier I guess. Right. Where does your friend go to to recycle? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's how it gets passed on. D You know, when one person, you hear from another person C and then, F uh, C and then you, C and then you pass it on. It seems to be catching on, F uh, slowly but surely, I guess <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow, that's cute. That's neat, yeah. When you, D Well, when you start early, I guess,
