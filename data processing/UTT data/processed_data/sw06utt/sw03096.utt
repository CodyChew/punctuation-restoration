D Well, F uh, ho, how do you view this whole subject? Are you, F uh, one who feels like you have, have benefited from the change in, in roles in women? C Or, C or what do you think? Uhhuh. Yes, <laughter> F oh, yes, I think so. Are you, F uh, are you someone who works outside your home, C or have you, F Oh, yes, D well, F uh, have there been significant changes, F uh, do you think in the employment place, ex, especially, <noise> F uh, say at T I. Have, has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? During your time there. Yeah, uhhuh. What, what kind of work do you do? Uhhuh. Right. Yes, yes. Yes, F uh, yes in years past, I know, in fact, even, even the word drafter has changed, C because, it used to be they were draftsman <laughter>. Right. Maybe not, F huh. D Well, F uh, I, when I was in college, I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixtyfour. C And I was a math major, which was a real rarity, among women at that time. C So, I was in a lot of classes where, F uh, there, I was either the only girl or, D you know, one of just a very, few women in the class. C So, that was a change C and, F uh, even, F uh, I did not, F uh, use my math, F uh, in my work, I, I became a technical writer. C But, F uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing. C But, that has changed a lot. In recent years it has just really, really changed a lot. C And, C and I think that, F uh, D you know, the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management, C but I think they have got a long way to go <laughter>. There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, F uh, chairmen of the board, chair, chair persons, F uh, A if you sa, if you will, of the board are women in this country. C And I thought that, D you know, that's pretty si, a pretty significantly small number. C So, there are some, some strides to be made there. C But, F uh, I do not know, I, I think we have come a long way, actually, when I think about, D you know, when things were like even, when I, D you know, just when I was in high school, and how it is now for girls. C And, F uh, <Inhaling> F uh, I guess my, I, F uh, the one, my one bad thing is that I am, that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, I think she would have really, she rea, would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that men, that women were not able to succeed, in her, generation. D So, D anyway. Do you have children? I was going to say do you have daughters. That's always a good question. Yes. In fact, I have a daughter who is in a, a, who just graduated in civil engineering, from college. D So, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, D you know, F uh, one of the minorities, F uh, females in the class. C So, she definitely entering into, F uh, a male profession. C But, F uh, C But, D you know, for instance there are, there is the organization women, the Society of Women Engineers, C so, that is recognized, as, F uh, D you know, a place where women should be. C But, F uh, <inhaling> I do not know, I, you see it in, F uh, also in, F uh, D like in church, F uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers. In, F uh, D you know, in protestant congregations C and, F uh, it will be interesting to see if, if Roman Catholicism ever, F uh, recognizes women in, in the role of priest. I do, I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or, D you know, what you know about that. I am not either, C but, F uh, that is one area where it, <noise> that I can see might change, but I really doubt will change <laughter>. <Laughter>. No, probably not. Huhuh. D So, F uh, F uh, how about, what in particular would you think that, F uh, women still, other than the work place, where women still are being, F uh, F oh, D you know, found wanting, D you know, or not re, as highly regarded as men would be. F Uh, I was just trying to think. F Oh, I know something. Maybe you could te, what do you think that, what do you think, tell me what you think about this. <Inhaling> The, F uh, the, F uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war? C Because, I know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles. C And the only, F uh, branch in the armed fo, services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force. C And, F uh, I spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, D you know, for whatever reason, into, F uh, in the Persian Gulf war. C And so. C But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job. It was real interesting, they were. I was listening to some of the comments on ra, television the other day, F uh, about it, C and, <inhaling> F uh, one of, one of the men who was a, I do not know if he was a general or, D you know, what his rank was, very high. He said, it's just a personal thing with me. E I mean, I can not be real, D you know I can not tell you why I feel this way, but I just would rather have, F uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman. I thought, D well, at least he was honest <laughter>. C But, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, I am sure <laughter>. Yeah, right <laughter>. D You know, Neil, D well Neil as far as I am concerned, A C and I could be wrong about this, C but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength, to do something. F Uh, C because, I would think, I think, D you know, mentally, F uh, and emotionally, I think women can handle a job and, every bit as well. C So D anyway it's still <<several words spoken while B is talking>>, Sure. No, I would not either. No, I <laughter> agree C but I am sure that there are women who would, would relish that, D you know, kind of job. C So, F Uh, I guess that should be taken into consideration, as well. D So, D well, this is an interesting topic, F um, I have, D you know, I have, having a daughter who has gone into this, into engineering, I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did <laughter>. She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and, a little more assertive, than I think I was <laughter>. C So, that's, that's progress, I guess <laughter>. <Inhaling> D Well, I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa, C and, F Uh, have you talked with a lot of people in this project C or, Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Right, Yeah, D well, that's great, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, Yeah, D well, that's good, that's good, C because, F uh, I, I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls. And, F uh, only because I going to make some money, see we, our choir is doing this as a money ma, raising project. We, we got the connection through a T I, <noise> F uh, church member. C And, F uh, F uh, so we are doing it to raise money for, F uh, a large project at church, C and, F uh, so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful <laughter>. Financially painful, anyway. It's just real nice that way C so, F uh, I thought, D well I will just get on the stick and do it. D Well, I will say goodbye to you, C but I have enjoyed the conversation. Thank you. Byebye. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah I, yeah, I think so. Yeah, there's been a lot of changes. I think there's still a lot to be made, though. <Laughter> Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah I work for T I. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, F Uh, I guess there's more women in, F uh, what would be classified as a man's job <laughter>. I am a drafter. I am in a man's job <laughter>. C But we have got more women in it now. There's a lot of us in it. D So. F Uh. Uhhuh, we have some engineers that still, on their, F uh, the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman. C And I want to scratch it out and <laughter> put drafter <laughter>. C But I thought, D well I am, not going to do that <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, definitely, definitely. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Do you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly. No, huhuh. <Laughter> Do you? F Oh, wonderful. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. <Laughter>. No, huhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Not for a long time anyway. <Laughter>. <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, oh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Huh. Yeah, yeah. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women <laughter>. Yeah, yeah, yeah. F Oh, I do too. Uhhuh, uhhuh. C And, D you know, if she wanted to go to combat, I do not see that they should stop her. I personally would not want to go C but <laughter>, F Oh, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. Good. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, same here. <Inhaling> D Well, I am not a home, at home a lot. I am at work right now. I put my work number, C but, at home, F uh, the recorder gets my calls. Usually, I am not there, C but I probably talked to seven or eight people. Uhhuh. I personally have not made any calls yet, myself, I, just, it never crosses my mind. <Laughter> C But I enjoy receiving them. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's wonderful. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's great. Okay. D Well, thanks for calling. Uhhuh. Byebye.
