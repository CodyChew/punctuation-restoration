Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it? Yeah. Yeah, C so do you have a, do you have a garden, C or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn? D Well, that's pretty good. My, my sister is very over zealous, too. She's got some really nice flower beds. She puts a lot of time into them. This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff. F Oh, we, I've always had crude ones at my father's, C but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house. His house is more like a farm house. It's not on a main road. My house is on a main road, C and it has nothing <laughter>. E I mean, nothing. C But, F um, what I do do, and I've always done it is, at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens. I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre. C So we each have a third of an acre we do. That's a lot <laughter>. Yeah, D well, it's my dad's, C and we've had it for ov, he's been there for a long time C so, F um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it C but, F um, they put up a nice fence, C so we still have a <static> lot of privacy, C and we grow a lot of food. F Uh, I enjoy it, F um, the gardens are kind of old, you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much, C but there's still, we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. C But I wish this phone would stop screeching, Yes. I'm trying, I don't know if it's my phone. This is bad. It's not getting any better. F Oh, okay. I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that, C but every time I have this phone is a little weird, E I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times. Yeah, I was beating on the phone going, Can you hear me. Yeah. Yeah, we grow a lot of, F uh, the basic, corn, potatoes. She likes to really get into her pumpkins C and see how many she can grow. Bas, corn, potatoes, C and, F uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers. E I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste D you know, we eat it, we, just too much. She, she starts her own plants. She plants a lot of tomatoes I let her do all the planting and putting, C and I, I do a lot of the, F uh, a lot of the, the ba, the back work, and stuff. C But she does, she helps me a lot, too. She puts a lot of financial. She plans it all out. Beans like to be near certain types of plants. D Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, F uh, peas, I don't know. Something, No, it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans. I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off, they just don't like each other. E I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books, C so. I wish I knew more to tell you why, C but, Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, that's really weird. I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden C and D like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe. C So they've been pretty close together. C But I don't think the vines. They don't real, they don't have to be touching or anything, like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees, F Um, Something weird. This year, this last season it was too wet up here we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes, C and we got half our yield. It was really bad because of the water. Yeah. Yeah, I have to do that, I want to make some flower beds, C and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil. C And I'm going to, my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter C but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, D you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there E I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I just don't think you, I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird C but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering. C And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated. Yeah, C but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too. Yeah. D Well, I'm not really worried about it, it's mainly for flower bed, C so I'm not going to, no goi, I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there. C But, I, yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never, my flower gardens are always been D like on the ground. They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up. Yeah, this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch C and I can tell you there's nothing around it, cement foundation all the way around it. Not a shrub, not a bush. There was a lilac tree, C and the landlord cut it down C and said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding C And I'm looking at him like, Jeez. <laughter> People would kill to have a lilac bush C and he's cutting it down <laughter>. C So. That's all right. Flower beds are all right. Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding. Yeah, that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast. Some people, F uh, would really like to have them, C and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over th, their lawn. C So, they're kind of a pain, C but, D you know, people who don't have them think they're great. C And people who do have them, curse. Another thing I have that, F um, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard. As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed, they aren't trimmed at all. C And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down C so, C and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it. They're a pretty tree, C but you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns. C So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead, <Laughter> Yeah, because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would rip your skin. It's worse than a rose bush. Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree. Yeah, my dad used to work on them, C so I don't think I'll have a problem. My husband will have problems borrowing one. D Well, if that's not the problem... Yeah, D well, I, F um, about, E or just over a year ago I bought my own house, C so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, F uh, be working on my own lawn and garden, C and, F uh, D you know, when, back when I was a kid, D you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden. I, I'd hate it, D you know. D Now, I sort of take pride in, F uh, in the yard, and, D you know, how the place looks, C and, F uh, C so I don't mind doing it so much anymore. D Well, it's, D yeah, it's, it's primarily just, F uh, D like landscaping a little bit. D You know, I've got some, F uh, bushes around the fou, D you know, foundation planning, things like that, C and then there's some, just some little flower beds, C and my mom grows, she's an avid gardener, C and she starts her own stuff from seed now, C and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them. F Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden. They have a huge yard and a huge house, C and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Jeez, that's more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, <static> F uh, garden, that's amazing. Right. F Oh, jeez. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line? Yeah, I can't even hear what you're <static>, F Oh jeez, it's gone. D Well, I don't know, there was D well, whatever it was, there was a second there I couldn't even hear what you were saying, C but, F um, Yeah, I guess I was having a hard time there too. I thought it sounded, D well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people F uh, F uh, doing this work. C But, F uh, yeah, E I mean, that's a heck of a pla, you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there, especially up in Vermont there, you should have, F uh, some really nice soil. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really because of D like the crosspollination, C or, F Huh. F Huh. My mom put, F uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once, C and the got cross pollinated by the bees C And we ended up with these, these, D like things on the cantaloupe vines that, E I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers. Yeah, E I mean, there, these were like some mutant. F Huh. No, it's just the, D like the bees and insects will do it. Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, D well. Yeah, when I, my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts, C and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard, C and, F uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden. C So we trucked in, F uh, I think it was seven, A what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards, I think that's how they measure dirt yeah, seven yards of sand. I got to shovel it all, lots of fun. Uhhuh. Sure. Right. D Well, it seems, I've seen a lot of people use them, D you know, for flower beds, C but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything, E I mean, Uhhuh. D Well, you can get, F um, you can get pressurized lumber, F Oh, that's right. there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too. All right. Right. D Well, you can see it a little better C and it stands out. F Um. F Oh, gee. Yeah. Rub up against the siding. F Uh, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, they're like, I think I've seen those before, C but I don't remember what they look like. C So it'll give you room to get under it, sure, Yeah. F Um. F Oh, a tree is always something very nice to have. <Laughter> then you got to get him to, if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it.
