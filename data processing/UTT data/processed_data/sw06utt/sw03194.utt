Uhhuh. That's okay. That's okay, it's more, F uh, concentrated, so they know where you are. F Uh, anyway, I know here in, here in Plano some of the things that we do are, F um, Kroger C and some of the other stores, too, have said, If you bring your bags back to, to the store to recycle, then they'll pay you a certain amount of money, C and that's one thing that started in the community. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, yeah, I know Kroger will do it, C and I think Albertson's does it sometimes, I'm not sure. F Um, C and, C and yet, I know that, F uh, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, the, F uh, community, like through the schools or things like that. C So, F um, that's always helpful, C and I know that we ha, we have the, the can, the can, different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that. F Um, one of the ways, I don't know, F uh, if this would be helpful. It said on the, the computer, what do I think would be helpful. C And I don't know if it would be helpful or not, C but I know on Monday, the, the garbage men pick up D like just, F um, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have, C And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a, a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, D like either glass or newspapers or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, D you know, do that because I have to pick it up, C and it just goes out with our trash, C and I guess I'm not as, F um, recycling minded as I should be <laughter>, C but that goes out with the trash, C and it really could be recycled. Did you? Tell me. Don't you have to take D like labels off of those jars? Yeah. Take them off, yeah. Soda, both liter sodas can you do that. Okay. Right, right. <Laughter>. I, I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just, F um, get it into different categories like that, C and I, I don't know what it would take to, to get my children to start working on it. I have two older ones that probably would go along with the, if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project, D you know. Okay, Yeah. Uhhuh. Oh. All set. Actually I'm in Plano, too <laughter>. I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere. Yeah. They actually pay you money for that? F Um, F um, Brookshires up in F uh, Allen, F uh, you bring your bags back, D you know, they, F uh, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there, C but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that. F Um. Uhhuh. Interesting. Right. Right. Yeah, I think they already do that out East. F Um, they have to, it's a little bit more difficult, because people have to remember, Okay, today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic, and all that C but I think that's the way we need to go. It's, F uh, it's pretty bad. All these years we've been, especially in this country, all the, F uh, the plastic and the paper and everything, we just used to throw out. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, about six months ago I started yeah, C and, F uh C so what I do is, F uh, it's not bad, you just have to have a place to keep everything, C but, F uh, it, you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it. Just put your paper in the same place every day, C and it'll start stacking up. Take your glass, F um, D you know, pickle jars, or, or whatever, F uh, liquid jars, D you know, just rinse them out a little bit C and put them all in a place, and, F uh plastics, No, from what I understand, F uh, you can leave the labels on, F um, although I rip, rip them off. I don't, I don't scrub them or anything, I just tear them off throw the lids and everything out, C but, F uh, put all the glass in one place, and plastics, like milk jugs, F uh, orange juice jugs, things like that. Yes those also. F Um, and then, of course, F uh, cans, coke cans, whatever. C But, F uh, I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take, and all that, I've just read a lot about it, C and I'm keeping these big piles of it right now <laughter>, I going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact. C But, F uh, you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up. There's a lot that we throw out. Uhhuh. It's, D yeah, it's not a big deal. You get used to it. One, let me tell you one interesting thing when I went back to the store, and I said, Hey, F um, I understand you all are taking these bags back, F uh, D you know, what do you do with them. C And they told me, they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then, D you know, go and recycle the rest. C And I said, What do you mean the ones that don't belong there? C And they said, D Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles. C And what I found out is, if you look at the bottom of those bags, Kroger or whatever the plastic ones, they've got numbers on them. Yeah, C and if it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number, like bags from Drug Emporium have a...
