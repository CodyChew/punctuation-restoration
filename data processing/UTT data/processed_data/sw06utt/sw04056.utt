Okay, should begin. F Uh, I can begin this, F um, basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis C and the, the benefit program we have here is really quite good. I'm, I'm pretty pleased with it. They cover, F uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical F uh, you name it, C and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much, C so I'm pretty satisfied myself. F Um, what's your situation? Oh. Uhhuh. Are you a professor there? F Oh, I see, okay. F Oh, no doubt <laughter>. Right. D Well, that's good. Yeah, that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is, F uh, I used to work with the Army Research Institute, C and being a, F uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off. C But here you don't get that. You maybe get two or three a year. C So it's really, unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, F um, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time. C So, that's, that's kind of a drawback I think. C But, F uh. I don't know. What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of, of the different benefits? Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night, they, F uh, they basically reviewed Oregon's plan E or The Oregon Plan toward, F uh, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing. It's kind of an interesting plan. It's kind of cold though. They've essentially made up a list of, F uh, F oh, all the different, F uh, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff, about six hundred and eightyseven and below will not be covered by, by, F uh, subsidized health care, C and the ones above would. C So it's kind of like drawing this line C and, C and if you have it great, if you don't, you're kind of out of luck C but, F um, it was kind of an interesting show. I think you're right, I think health care is probably the, the most pressing F uh, the pressing one, C but I'll tell you, I, I don't mind having dental, D you know, sometimes dental costs can be, F um, just about as expensive, if not more, C and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical C but I'm not sure that's, that's widely followed any more. I'm not sure, how, how does, F uh, University of New Hampshire handle it? F Um. Great. Is that, F uh, A let me interrupt, is that the same for both, F uh, professors and, and also staff and administration, is that generally across the board, do you think C or, Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Right. Yeah, I'm kind of interested because I'm D actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to, F uh, is to teach in a university. I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now C but, F uh, yeah, that's, that's interesting. That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would, F uh, they would cover and things like that. F Oh, is that right? Okay. All right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I work for the University of New Hampshire, C and F uh, our benefits package isn't, F uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. F Uh, D you know, overall I'm satisfied with it. We don't have the vision care, we do have the health care and the, F uh, and the medi, E or the dental. F Uh. No, I work in, I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff, C and I, effectively I run the telephone switch at, F uh, at the University of New Hampshire. F Uh, D so the, F uh, the benefits, F uh, probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, F uh, the, F uh, very generous vacation time and sick time. We get fifteen days a year sick time, C and, F uh, we get twentyfour days a year, right from the day one when you start work, you get twentyfour days a year, F uh, time off. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I think, F uh, the, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit C and, F uh, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, F uh D you know, I'm, I'm a little disturbed about that, C but I think that's a national trend, C and I don't know that, F uh, I don't know what the solution is to it. It's bigger than just the benefits part. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, yeah. F Um. Uhhuh. F Um. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, F uh, depending, C and, C and the cost between them is very, is very little. I think it costs me something like five dollars a, a month for the dental plan. C But it pays, F uh, a substantial amount. E I mean, the examinations and, and, F uh, checkups every year, E or every six months are free C and, F uh, it, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses. F Uh, yes, it is. The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, F uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff, which I belong to C but the main, I think the, the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan. C But the main difference is in the, F uh, the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued. F Uh, for the operating staff it's on a seniority, it's, D you know, based on how long they've worked there. That determines how much, F uh, vacation time they get. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. College programs belong to this T I A A, F uh, C R E F retirement fund. Right, C and in the case of the University of New Hampshire, F uh,
