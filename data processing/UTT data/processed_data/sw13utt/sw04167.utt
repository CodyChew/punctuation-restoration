Well it's, uh, I'll start off here. Uh, I don't know. I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N. Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, <sniffing> you know, repeats it, well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule and, uh, but the newspaper p, provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from, <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. I know, the, my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada. Uh, Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything and, uh, it's amazing that, you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know, I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section. Uh, you know. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada. Uh, well part of it, touring. And, uh, you know, i, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on. There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec and n, I had never heard any of that before. Uhhuh. Right, right. Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show. I used to get the, uh, Right, yeah. Yeah. I, I think I'd agree. A, a s, similar method of getting the news with me too. It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to <laughter> the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years. Uh, p, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts. Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth. That, that's true, you know. You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other wor, news events going on in either of those countries. Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them. Yeah. I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>. You just, never see, you just never see anything about it, uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh, and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand. And if you go up to, uh, Canada, <noise> those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico. You just don't know what's going on. I'd, I, every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too. You you can tune into some stations and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events. Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area and that's the only way you can tell <laughter> what's going on at all <laughter>. There's not much in the way of television in some of those places. Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries. I hadn't really thought about it but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it. Yeah. Yeah, you know, there was, a, a, what is it called, is it Meech Lake Accord? Or, or, i, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it. And, and c, came, it was a big thing going on there and I came back here and nothing in the papers. I didn't see a thing about it. So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess. It's improved. And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news. Even, even there's, uh, uh, it's sor, it's semireligious in some respects. But what is it? It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way, uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel. The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR. Uh, I, it surprised me. I've caught it a few times and they, they do some pretty good news. Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts. Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising. You'd think it would carry mostly religious but it, it doesn't seem to. So I'll flip through and <throat_clearing> listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering. Uh, some more in, interest type topics in, in other countries. But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.
