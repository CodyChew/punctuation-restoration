Okay. No, I don't play any. I used to. I think everybody took piano lessons so, <Laughter>. Do you? I started, I think I was in the fifth grade and I played it for maybe three months <laughter>. Wow <laughter>. <Laughter>. All right <laughter>. Yeah. True <laughter>. <Laughter>. Only for about three months. Yeah, me and my brother both took the classes and we got pretty bored quick <laughter>. Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song. And I still can to this date. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. Yep, they went out and bought us a piano and for three months <laughter>. <Laughter>. Oh, yeah, any time I got bored <laughter>. No. And Jaws, but I think everybody can. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Do you sing at choir at your church? Yeah. Yeah. I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade and they wouldn't let me in. <Laughter> So, I never tried again. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah, <Laughter>. I never really learned the music or anything. I never learned, I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano and that's about when I quit. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> Of course, parents always do. They're nice that way. <Laughter>. Uh, well, I don't, d, so you listen to kind of church music, gospel? Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, the jeezer music as I call it. Yeah. My boss listens to that. We listen to ninetyseven point nine and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music. Well, I listen to like ninetyseven point one, you know, more, It's more, uh, <breathing> I don't know how to explain it, kind of pop, you know, rock. Yeah. Well, not hard <laughter>. Just kind of, Huh? Yeah. It's not too hard, it's, You know. But it's not enough to put you to sleep <laughter>. Which some of the songs on K V I L can. Oh, yeah, got the bumper sticker, too? <Laughter>. Someday. <Laughter>. Okay. Okay. Byebye. All right, well d, d, do you play any musical instruments or, Oh well, Everybody, sure. I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade, and I've, I still play the piano as of today. Yes, I do. But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band. I played the drums, I played the clarinet, I played the trumpet. Uh, you know, whatever and so I, I still sing, and I sing in the choir today so, I en, I enjoy the music, it gives me an out. It always sounds like, for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know. <Laughter>. So, how long did you play? Three months. I was going to say, y, y, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh. Oh, the wood chuck song <laughter>. <Laughter>. And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song <laughter>. Oh, bless your heart. Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all. Oh, okay, but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song? No. Okay. I c, I, I can still read music if I'm lucky because I, if I work real hard I can still barely read the music, but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school, so I played chic, uh, concertos and other stuff but, I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music, so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to, but anyway, but I enjoy it, though. I find it to be a good out and I still enjoy the marching band and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir so, Yes, I do. Yes, I do. That's, in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Well, I sing in the choir, I do know if they want me to or not, but at least I do sing in it <laughter>. <Laughter> That's pretty good. Well, I was at, I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, c, be a musician. I wanted to be a high school band director. But after one semester of that, I said n, no, no, this isn't for me. enjoy it, but not for profession, no. And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good <laughter>. I gave up. Course, my mom thought I was, but, uh, you know, Oh, yeah, so, Yes. Well, what else can we d, uh, talk about, uh, No, no, I, I listen to K V I L. Yeah. So I listen to the radio, I like the pop music. I like people like Neil Diamond and <laughter> all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like, but that's who I go for <laughter>. Oh, the jeezer music. Oh, okay, well, Okay, now what d, kind of music do you listen to? What d, what is that? Rock. Hard rock? Not hard rock. Not like the eagle. Is that the eagle? Okay, I know, I know what the eagle is. That's not too hard. True, true. Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests. I mean <laughter>, Oh, yes, oh, yes. You can't drive a car without bumper sticker and you know they're going to call you up. Yeah <laughter>. Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking.
