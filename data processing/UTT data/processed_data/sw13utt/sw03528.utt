Night, I understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight. I hope you know more about it than I do. F Oh, is that right? I haven't read his book. I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible. D Well, C and I don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in TEXAS C so I wasn't sure how credible he was. C But anyway, what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights? Ego trip. Uhhuh. F Oh, is that right? Uhhuh. Right. Where do you live? You live in U, am I talking to Utah right now? F Oh, F oh, great. C Because I'm in Dallas. <Laughter>. I see. I see. Carolyn Rash? Is her name Rash, Carolyn Rash? I see. I see. D Well, you probably know a lot about it. I wasn't sure that they were blaming that sp, space disaster on one company. I hadn't heard that. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah, I would think so, too <noise>. You never think about that do you? I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, I saw one of, some of those early space capsules at Smithsonian. I'm sure you've seen more of them than I have, C but you could see the scorch on them, D you know, they had though piles C but you could see where they would come off in the, how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting. D Well, I, E excuse me, go ahead. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, these were the ones that John Glenn went up in D you know, and the old, old ones. The very first ones, the little bell type things. Yeah, they really were, they just, F uh, F Oh, yeah, C and, F uh, the whole thing was small C and, D yeah, you, E I mean, you actually put it on <laughter>, D you know. You put it around you pretty much, it was so small. D Well, I thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space, C but did he go into that in the book? I guess that's just to sell us on it. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, that's true C and, That's right <laughter>. D Well, do you think we should continue to support it at the level, D well, I thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying. C Because I think those satellites, D you know, or not satellites, but the spaceflights could really spy C and with, F uh with Russia's demise, I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level. Yeah. F Uh. No, I don't. I don't either. Yeah. Fine, thank you. Yes. F Oh, D well <laughter>, I just got through renting, reading, F uh, SPACE by, F uh, James Michener. C And so that, F uh, helped out a little bit I think. D Well, he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes. F Oh, is that right? D Well <breathing>, F uh, <breathing> <noise> I'm not sure to be honest with you, D so, F uh, this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure C and, F uh, C And, yeah, it was nice to go there, C but I don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much. I happen to live not too far away from, F uh, D well, I've actually worked for the company that, F uh, has been blamed for the Challenger disaster. F Uh Morton Thiakol. C And, F uh, D you know, that's been kind of a, a real negative feeling here is D sure it was, D you know, very unfortunate thing that occurred there C and it's, F Uh, we live in, F uh, Utah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, Oh. I have a sister that lives in Dallas, that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for Penney's there. D So. Pardon me? No, her name is, F uh, my last name is Skidmore. C And her, her husband's name is, his last name is Weight. C And, F uh, <Breathing>. D Well, they were. There was, F uh, apparently the specifications for the joints, F uh, they were not to perform in, F uh, cold weather C and, F uh, apparently there was definitely a, a joint that did not <noise> seal, C and, F uh, if you've ever seen the size of those, F uh, motors that put them into space, E I mean, they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter C and, C and there is a lot of pressure, lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air. D So it's, this book was interesting, though. I, F uh, talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come, overcome to, F uh, it's a very complex, F uh, situation to go into space. They would, the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how, how much of a problem it is to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. C But they have to come in at a, just the right angle. If you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space C and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up. D So, Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, I've, I've, E I would say I've never, I've never seen an actual capsule. I've seen more, more of the motors that, that they produced out there. Uhhuh. Yeah. People have commented how, F uh, they were surprised at how small they were. Looked pretty confining, F huh. Is that right? F Huh. Not really. F Uh, <throat_clearing>, One thing's, I know one thing they've, they've mentioned that I didn't get from the book, by the way, C but, it talked about, F uh, they're able to manufacture, F uh, different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost, F uh, nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes. It's perfectly round. C But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. F Uh, I think they have cut it back, to be honest with you. From, from the glory days when they did the Apollo shots to the moon. F Uh, I appreciate having the satellites. D You know, that's certainly made it nice for other purpose. I don't know if you have a satellite dish or not. We don't C but I I know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard. F Uh,
