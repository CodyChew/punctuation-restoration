You interested in woodworking? F Um. What kind of pine? Uhhuh. I guess he's young. <Laughter>. F Oh, he'll be delighted. Did you do it with a jigsaw C or do you have powered, D you know, a, F Um. D Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking. I don't have lots of tools. Our local schools have adult education in the evening F uh, C and I use their tools m, a, an, and, some of their guidance. I'm an artist. C And I'm very handy C and, D you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us, usually. I'm, F Uh, D well D actually, I'm very, D you know, I have a Master's degree C and, C and my projects had to do with acrylic painting, C but I'm really interested in the crafts. I make stain glass. I've done some silver jewelry making C and I kind of, once I get so, D you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else <laughter>. Yeah, D well no, D actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say F oh wow, you didn't buy it, you made it. C And then I, it's like D well the thrill is gone <laughter> C so let's do something else. D Well, yeah, I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making <laughter> because I've never tried that yet C but, D Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art C and it's in art education. C So, I'm a licensed teacher C but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach C and that way I have time for my kids too. C And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work parttime. I don't know how long that's going to last <laughter>. C And, F uh, they're cutting back, C so I don't go in all that often C but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things. F Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars C and I say, F oh no C and, C and I go C and I make it. That's how I started jewelry making. I, I love to cook. C And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff C and I went C and I signed up for class because then again, you get, D you know, get someone to guide you C and you get the tools you don't feel like buying. C And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars <noise> <swallowing>. It took me a lot of time C but it didn't, C but if it cost me twenty dollars, D you know, C and then I, Yeah. Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons. It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. I went there, we have Home Depot out here. I don't know if you've heard of it. I went C and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon. I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath C and cutting that wedge out was no joke <laughter>. <Laughter> We did it on a, I had a, F uh, I did it through Adult Ed again. I did it through Adult Ed again. C And the teacher was one of these negative people, F oh that's dangerous, we can't do that, we just can't do that. C And I'm going D well how about this way? I, I want to do that, that was the plan here <laughter>. D So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it. D Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw C but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that C and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw. I said I'm not that steady, it's not going <<mispronounced>> to happen. D So we built a cradle for it C and we got th, A once it was turned, we got one s, one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw, C by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about <laughter>. D So, F Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth. D You know jus, Yeah. D Actually, I, F uh, I guess I am <laughter>. F Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion. F Uh, I do, F uh, some, F uh, woodworking myself <noise>. F Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son. It's, F uh, It's, F uh, it's, F uh, plywood, F uh, face, I guess. C But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box C and then I painted, F uh, about eight different, F uh, colors, F uh, D you know, the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard C and then, yes <laughter>. He's about five and a half years old. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Now I just have to finish it though. I got, F uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, F uh, because of work C and now, F uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the, C because I've got it all cut out, it's all, F uh, I've done most of the coloring C but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow. F Uh, yeah. F Uh, I did, F uh, jigsaw, F uh, and the, F uh, regular straight saw for some of it. D So yeah. to do the, F uh, th, the turn cut. F Uh, how about yourself? Oh. F Oh, okay. That's great. What, what type of art do you focus on? F Huh. Yeah. Kind of jack of all trades, master of none. That's great! Right. You want <<mispronounced>> to, F uh, e, explore a new field C or, C or, F Huh. D So you have a M F A in, in what division of art? F Oh, okay. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Huh. Yeah <noise>. Yeah. F Oh, that's great. F Huh. Yeah. Exactly. F Oh, yeah. And your time, then you're that much farther ahead <noise>. Right. I've seen them C and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in C and, That's neat. Yes. We have one. F Huh. F Oh, I'm, I'm sure. A band saw? What? Uhhuh. Right. A cradle for it. Yeah, so you can steady it C and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw? Right, right. Yeah. <Inhaling>. Right. D Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this? D Well, I, I'm envisioning, F uh, F uh, a water, a watermelon like a log C and then, F uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, F uh, the, F uh, it's, F uh, if you're looking at adding on you have,
