Okay <laughter>. Uh, well, yeah, for the last, uh, couple of months. Yeah. Well, it's kind of hard to say, uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years. We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eightynine and, uh, wait a minute, we bought one in ninety. We've got <laughter> three cars, of all things. So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan. Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X. Uh, <breathing> it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh, we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have and then, of course, we look into the prices. And, uh, f, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, long, a longer period of time. Uh, I traded off an eightytwo Oldsmobile for the eightynine Mazda. So, uh, Uh, yeah, yeah. We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life, and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars. And, uh, they, they, uh, I've been extremely, we've had three Mazdas. We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas. Yeah. Yeah, well, we, we've had, uh, let's see, we had, uh, we had a, uh, let me think. pause We had a fiftythree and a, uh, we had, uh, two fiftythrees which is a long thirty minute story <laughter>. Uh, and we had a sixtyfive and then we had this eightytwo. So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Well uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mad, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas. Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventyseven M G, M G B Was British gr, racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top. And, uh, I drove it mostly. And, Yeah, it really was. My husband was in the Air Force and we got transferred to Okinawa. So, uh, we had to sell it. W, which really tore me up <laughter>. Because, uh, it, it w, it was great fun. And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand, we, uh, we decided that, uh, we had this, uh, sixtyfive Oldsmobile and it, and it was just too big, so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan. Okay <laughter>. Have you done this very long? Yeah, that's the same with us. Well, what kind of car would you buy? Oh, okay. O, Uhhuh. Okay. What kind do you have now? Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh, uhhuh. And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic? Uhhuh. Oh, really? We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, we've been real pleased with ours. I think we've had, one, two, three and most, we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventyseven. Then we have a Cutlass Sierra and we've had the ninetyeight. So, but I don't know, we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year and <breathing>, the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company. But, I don't know what we're going to buy. I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car, but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty <laughter>. So, Oh. Oh the, Ooh, boy. I'll bet it was hard to part with that. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh.
