Good morning. , no, no, go ahead. F Oh, very good, C because D actually, F um, when I was in college I visited Mexico several times, I was in the Peace Corps and, F um, Peru, C but, C but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than, Central America <<very faint>>. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, did that have, F Um, C so, you don't, you don't feel that, that we were, F um, exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting C and they weren't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Di, did we tend to, F um, change their attitu, attitudes D like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things, Americanism, F um, consumer products, T V, the whole works. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Yeah, I was in Peru, C but, F um, I, there weren't, as I recall, E or at least I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers, this was when the Peace Corps first are started, C and it was one of the big targets C and, F um, I don't, I don't think, at that time, at least, Peace Corps was, F uh, an obnoxious group in the sense that, that we were very controlled regarding number of days off C and, C and you couldn't just, take up, take off and leave your group and go explore and, and things like that, C but, C and I was working actually in the savings and loan program, C so, that was quite specialized, although I was living in the slums, I was really working with the middle class. I was up in Arequipa. C And, F um <<very faint>>, Uhhuh <<very faint>> C so. I don't have any idea, F um, probably not, E I mean, there were thir, I was, F uh, Per, Peru thirteen, which meant there were twelve groups before mine, that had gone in C and, C and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development, C and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that, health, F um, inoculation and, and things. No, no, I believe they did C because, F um, some of, some of the, the Peace Corps, F uh, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians, and have been back C and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things, and of course, the savings and loan program, F um, that was, that, D you know, that, that just continued to grow. In fact, after my group, E I mean, we were just a very small specialized group, too, to get that going and spread C and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's, F uh, F uh, something that nationalized very quickly. And the same with the coops. Right. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Yeah, I've, D you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, F um, the language teaching, D you know, E I mean, why should we push English, C and a lot of people were down there teaching English C and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, D you know, to me that's a little bit marginal. I did teach economics at the university one night a week, C and the textbook was in English, C but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, E I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test. Good morning. F Uh, okay, go ahead. Yeah, I understand the topic this morning is, F uh, our policy in Latin America and, D you know, what we've been doing down there. C So, F uh, as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it, it just so happens that, F uh, our daughterinlaw is Panamanian, C and, F uh, we have been in Panama C and I have worked in El Salvador C and, F uh, we visit Mexico occasionally, C so, <laughter>, yeah, we, we do have a little information on it here, C but, F uh, F Oh, uhhuh <<very faint>>. Yeah. Yeah, it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's, that's for sure. No, I, the U S policy, F uh, towards Central America as far as, F uh, D well, I kind of go back to, to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a, a plant down there for a while, C and I worked in there for a little while, C and at that particular time, let's, let's see, that was seventythree, seventyfour kind of before the, the, F uh, the Civil War really picked up down there, C and U S policy at that particular time there was, of course, military assistance to, F uh, to the government itself, D you know, anything that's, that's antiCommunist, D you know, we kind of had a tendency to be pro <laughter>. It don't matter what their excesses were, C and I believe at the time that I was down there, that, F uh, the government, F uh, the Salvadorian government D you know, really gotten out of hand yet, the, F uh, right wing death squad type situation I believe that, that was beginning to form C but I don't, I, I wasn't really aware of it's being, D you know, terribly, F uh, D you know, at the time that, that I was down there, I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on, C but, F uh, our policies seem to be pretty much one of, F uh, D you know, trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource, anyway, that Salvador had, <throat_clearing>, plenty of C and that was people. We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's, it's labor, C because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in C and it was worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here, C so, I didn't feel that we really ex, exploiting them any. No, F uh, in the particular incidence that I was aware of, D now T I wasn't the only ones in there, Playtex was in, there was, F uh, several other companies, C and, F uh, of course, we kind of concentrate on, there wasn't much to take out of the country I felt like we're going in and taken all their, F um, their gold or oil, or bananas or coffee or anything like that, C because, F uh, it just, the only thing that they had a great abundance of was, F uh, D you know, human beings <laughter> C and, F uh, Yeah, I understand what you say. There was a, F uh, the time that I was down there, I stayed quite a, a bit at the, F uh, F uh, one of the big hotels San Salvador. C And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists. Because they, for the most part, tend to be the most obnoxious as a, as a group, C and I saw this in Panama also, F uh, F oh, D you know, it's, it's the, F uh, the almost stereotype, D you know, flowery shirt, shorts, camera hanging around their neck, D you know, demanding this, that and the other thing, D you know, we're, we're here, C and we want this, C and we want that, and that sort of thing, that's, that's the stereotype that's very strong down there, D you know, the, the, the, D you know, that sort of thing, I, I, I believe those of us who were working down there, got a little bit more appreciation for, D you know, the local, F uh, culture I really don't believe that we were quite that bad, C but yet they were having to deal directly with, F uh, D you know, with the, F uh, the local people. C And, F uh, C but boy there is a, there is a bad, F uh, F uh, D you know, the old brash or ugly Americantype, situation. C And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say, F oh, my God those are, those are not Americans <laughter> they can't be. C But there are C and, F uh, of course, D now I, I do have to, I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad, C but E I mean, it, I think it's just kind of the North American situation. In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long C but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as <laughter>, as, F uh, as as Americans, as far as, F uh, creature comforts, D you know, they're, F uh, they're, they're every bit, F uh, I, I know, when, my, my son was in the Air Force C and he was stationed in Panama, C and he married a Panamanian girl, C and when she came up here, F uh, D you know, she's, y, kn, except for the language situation, some of the cultures she's just about an American, D you know, is as far as T V and, and, D you know, the, the moneymaking part of it and all that, matter of fact if anything, she's worse. <Laughter> C But, F uh, F uh, it, it just, there's little enclaves down there where, D you know, Americans have a lot of influence C and the local population kind of, F um, D you know, sort of accepts that, C but I've also seen the other side of it, too. D Well, you were in Peru? Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. What, F uh, what area did you live in? F Oh, okay yeah. I've heard of it. D Well, is, are they, is Peace Corps still active down in there? Uhhuh. F Oh, has those influences lasted do you know whether the, the things that, that you and your groups before you did, did those, did those live on C or were they reabsorbed C or how, Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. D Well, that's, that was kind of the, the aim wasn't it, to get it started and then have it, taken up by the, F oh, okay, o, D so, D you know, D well, that's, I had wondered sometimes, I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort C and a lot of work went into a lot of that, C and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, D you know, D like, F uh, r, Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Oh. Yeah, my brotherinlaw teaches at, F uh, Northern Illinois University C and they were in China, D here a couple of years ago, C and he was over there at, F uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching...
