I pushed it. D So what do you you in your lawn? Do you do it yourself C or do you hire someone to do it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, we do our own out here, F uh, D you know, mow it ourselves and everything, C but, F uh, our water supply right now is bad. We need rain badly <laughter>. F Uh, we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week. D So. It was this last summer, yeah. F Uh, D now if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times, D you know C but, F uh, yeah, we do our law, our, D you know, mowing ourselves and everything, C and I do our <chiming> planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers C and, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. We have quite a few roses. I just, F uh, we, in fact we just pruned them way down, C and I just had to replace one of them, C so I just bought that yesterday, C and I'll probably go outside today and plant that. C But, F um, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long. I even had, F uh, roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty, D you know <laughter>. C But, F um, other than the roses I don't have too many flowers. I plant gladiolas C and those are always pretty, C but they get so tall, C and they, they bend over so fast D you know. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, D well, is it that, one of those Amaryllis? No, F huh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. Do you have a big yard? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, right, right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, that makes it nice. D Well, it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool, C but we don't have one D you know, C but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here D you know C but we just, we just have dogs and, F um, <laughter> and grass D you know, the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden. C So we do have a garden, D you know. It's just a small one, D you know, C but we, had lots of tomatoes, and, F uh, zucchini it's amazing what you can get out of a little D you know, it's probably about twenty by, A I don't know, twenty by six, something like that, C and it's amazing what you can, D you know, how many plants you can plant in there C but it was nice. Few cucumbers. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Okay. F Uh, no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, F uh, find that it's really a little more economical, C and we have, F oh, I find that I have the time, C and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas. I used to live in Arizona, C and it was very con, very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering system C and it was, it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment. C But over here we get enough water automa, D you know, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers, C and so it's a lot more rewarding D so. F Oh, that's right. Uhhuh. Is that enough during the hotter times of the year? Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. <Chiming> Yeah, I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting, which I never did before C and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold, F um they'd freeze down, C and by the time they, the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting <laughter>. C So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding, C so F um, I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that, D you know, feels. Uhhuh. Yeah, those are enjoyable. F Oh, did you? Uhhuh <laughter>. F Um, those are nice. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. I haven't done much in, in bulbs. In fact I received as a Christmas present a, a planter that had bulbs in it, that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window, C and it it just grew like crazy, C but I don't have <laughter> any flowers on it. I don't know how long that takes, or if there's anything I need to do differently. It's just nice and green right now <laughter>. F Uh, no I'm thinking White Narcissus or something like a pa, like a white paper flower or so. C And, F uh. No, not really, C and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, F uh, they have just the, the minimum square footage for lots, to where you get a little bit of a backyard, we have a pool in our backyard, C and we did plan it to where we have some, some play yard left over, C but it's, it's, F um, D you know, very small. C But most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything else in the backyard that's about the size of most of them. C So, F uh I guess we're kind of fortunate. Everyone looks at that, with our yar, at our yard with kind of sense of awe, like wow, you really got, D you know, some grass <laughter> back there. D Well. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah. Yeah. . Oh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet, C and I don't think this yard is a very,
