<Noise> D Well, basically I think it would be a good idea myself. I, F uh, I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, D you know, to be afraid of it. F Uh, I do think that there has to be some controls, F uh, D like, I don't think one test positive should, F uh, be, F uh, <<pause>> the end of it, D you know. I, I think they should test more than once. It, <Static>. Uhhuh <baby>. That's right. <Baby> <<very faint>>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. There's so many jobs that, F uh, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life <baby> C and, D you know, C and it's, F uh F uh, how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it? D You know, C and I just, F um, I, I think there definitely needs to be some control to it. I guess it is possible to have a false <baby> positive report. <Baby>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's. E I mean, those things do happen. F Uh, I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined F uh, <noise> wrongly. Uhhuh <noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah C and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that, F uh, doesn't require the testing. F Uh, to me, it's, to me it's not an invasion or privacy. I think it's people have a right to know if, if, F uh, their, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, F uh, Yeah. Their work, the work they're doing for their company. F Uh, those things are all affected. If not immediately, it certainly does eventually. I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first. It doesn't seem to, F uh, bother the quality of work C but eventually it does. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem. I, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy, that's <static> the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for <noise>, D you know, C and it's destroying a lot of people's lives <static>. Yeah, C and it's, D you know, it's, it's destroying people's lives C and I, I think that person, plus anybody in danger should, should b, know about it and be aware of it. I don't know. It's, it's kind of hard to <<pause>> <lipsmack> I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, F uh, an invasion of privacy. Of course, that's not supposed to be <laughter> what we're talking about today, I guess. C So, <Laughter> I kind of get off on a tangent here. F Uh, do you work for, F uh, Texas Instruments? Uhhuh. <Baby> F Um. F Oh, that's probably why, my brother did live in Grapevine, Texas. That's near Dallas. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. It's pretty hot down there probably. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, did you really? F Oh, that's great. Uhhuh. We, we need rain real bad up here. It's, F uh, everything's really getting dry. It's, F uh, <Baby> Yeah. It's kind of at a dangerous level here. People hauling water, C and, F uh it's getting real bad. D So. D So. F Um <<pause>>. So do I <laughter>. F Uh, I can't think of anything else, F uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, I can understand <baby>. I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them, I can see <static> them objecting. D You know? there's a lot of people that <breathing> think that there's nothing wrong with <<pause>>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, I'll be darn. Yeah, yeah, <noise> the different cultures and that too, F uh <static>. No, no. I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way. I, I can't think that would make any <laughter> difference whether it was legal or not, it, <static> it would still have to affect you the same way. Uhhuh. Oh yeah. You can't you go by their laws. The same way <static> our people have to go by their laws when they're over there. That's why a lot get in trouble <laughter> because they have to follow their rules C and, F uh some of the countries are very much against drugs C and you use them, you <<pause>> pay for it <laughter>. . Yeah, a lot of them. Yeah. Where, where is it they lose the, if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger? Is that where it is? I thought, wow <laughter>. D You know, that's quite a deterrent <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C So I guess, D you know, we, re, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about <<pause>> how great out country really is. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They, they abuse it is what they do. Yeah. Yeah. D So, D Well, how do you feel about spot test, spot testing for drugs? Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, it's, it's it's refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine. E I mean, all these people that are against it that may, the, D you know, they may not even be on drugs. They, they call it an invasion of privacy. C And I don't see that. To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for C and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance <laughter>. C But, <Barking>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. <Barking> Yes. No, I, I, I agree that, D you know, you, there needs to be a, a well thought out, sane approach to, how to administer that program. Just because you, you, something can get mixed in the mail, C or F uh, the chemicals could react incorrectly than, than what you would expect them to. C And, yeah, you, D you know <<very faintly>>, Right. Yeah. Right, C and, D you know, I've the, the, the company that I work for, F uh, has just recently, D well, D you know, within the last couple of years, instituted for all new hired employees, they submit to a urine test. C And, they, they say that there's been, D you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing. C And, it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, D you know, it's been in progress C but, F uh, I, I fully agree with it C and there's, D you know, there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy, C and I, I agree with you. If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've, you've probably got something you're trying to hide <laughter>. Yeah. Right. Or, the quality of their product. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right, because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect. F Um. <Laughter>. C and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for <laughter>. Yeah. <<very faint>>. Yeah <laughter>. Yes, I do. C And I'm, I'm down in the, the central, C but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas, C but I'm in a, we live in a town, F uh, near a town called Temple. Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway. Right. We're probably about two, two and a half hours south of him. D So. F Oh my! It's, D actually, we got about two inches of rain in about three hours, yesterday. C And it's cooled things down somewhat. It's getting more humid now, C but, Uhhuh <<very faintly>>. Yeah <<very faintly>>. It's been about three weeks since we've had any. F Um. Wow. How about that? D Well, I hope you do get some rain up there. <Laughter> I <<very faintly>>, Yeah, I, I guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation D you know <laughter>. <Noise>. One of the things I found interesting, it, it's funny that you mentioned that, T I is pretty much a worldwide company C and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal. Yeah, <laughter> they don't have to submit to drug testing like, like they do here in the States and some places abroad. Yeah, I thought that was kind of interesting too. Yeah. E I mean, F uh, F uh, from a quality standpoint, that's not, E I mean, just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way. Yeah. <Noise> Right. Yeah, C but, D like if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules. I mean if, if, D you know, that, that's the trade off. Yeah. F Huh <laughter>. Right. Usually <laughter> with you life in some places. That's right. Yeah, from the Middle East. Yeah. Iraq, Iran, in that area. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, in Saudi Arabia, D you know, using, F uh, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty. C So, it's pretty strict over there <laughter>. D Well, people tend to take the first amendment out of context. Which, which means D you know, I could do anything I want to C and you can't stop me, C and D you know <laughter>, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C So, that's, I don't know. I'm, I'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy,
