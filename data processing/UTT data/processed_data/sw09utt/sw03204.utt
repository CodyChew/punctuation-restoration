F Uh, D well, about nursing homes, and, and older people. F Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother C and they're just really close here. C And his mother has bad health too C and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work C and I, F um, help with her and bathe her and feed her. C And, F uh, C and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe. It's really difficult to be a caretaker twentyfour hours a day. F Uh, i, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, F uh, a lot if anything. C And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not un, D you know, unrealistic. F Um, C and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question. F Uh, I, F uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, C and just bring the kids in the family C and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented. She's ninetytwo. F Oh, I think that's wonderful. D Well, Uhhuh. Yeah. I was just going to say. Yeah. F Um, Yes. F Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily C but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places. C And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves. F Um, Yeah, yeah <laughter>. <<Very faint>> Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Nursing homes. Visit. Uhhuh. They don't go and see them. That's right. That's right. D You know, F um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, F um, some are good I have to say that. C But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children. F Um, Right, right. Uhhuh. I hope so. D You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there. C And then if you find out that they are not having good care, D you know, I'm sure that it is just, D you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast. C And, F uh, C and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, F uh, it's a very, very hard decision I think. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. I think that's right, and especially if you're not a person that is D like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment. D Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, F uh, she brought to her home, F uh, to live there, C but he needed the medical treatment C and she had a nursing person come in D like three times a week to, to help him out. C And that might be a partial solution, or something. C But, F um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever, Yeah. <<Very faint>> Yeah. D Well, <lipsmack> I, I think we kind of are along the same lines. Good to hear from you. Have a lovely day. What is it about, nursing homes? Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, it's very difficult I know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah. Yeah, how old is she? F Uh, my, D see my father is ninetytwo C and still, F uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing, C but D you know if something would, F uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there. I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes C and so, They're in Missouri C and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, D well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them. C And, F uh, it's, it's tragic that, D you know, when people live so long that they, F uh, don't have a pla, really don't have a place to go. D So, Right. Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are C but, F uh, I think it would be nice C but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything. C So, F uh, E I mean, he's from that old depression era C and, F uh, D you know, it's, F oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves. I would imagine that I'll, F uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or bot, D you know, in, in with me. D So, F uh, C But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is C and, C but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, F uh on this homes. C But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a, I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot. C And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them. They never go to see them. I've talked to many, F uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, I do too. Or if, i, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so. F Uh, C because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing ho, homes, F uh, regulation in Texas C so maybe we'll get it improved. D So. D Anyway. Right. F Oh, it's tough I'm sure. Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure C so. It is a tough decision C and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Right. I would hope we could do that, and then go from there. D Well, D anyway, We've covered a little bit C and, F uh, it's good to hear from you C and, Have a good, Have a good lif,
