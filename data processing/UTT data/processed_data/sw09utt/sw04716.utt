Okay. F Um, I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten, I guess, I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns C and I think there should be limitations of, D like semiautomatics. F Uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody. In fact, D you know, I can't imagine <talking> anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose. F Uh, C so I guess, D you know, being that I come from a hunting family <Talking> I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, F uh, things that people would use for sporting type of, F uh, a, activity. Those would be fine C but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, I would say yes we need to put restrictions on them <talking>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly, for selfprotection, sure. I can't imagine that. Yeah. Uhhuh. To do massive amounts of killing, F uh, Yeah. The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, F uh, F uh, D you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, F uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, F uh, very dangerous semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, F uh, get him down. C But, F uh, D you know, I, I think of my family. F Uh, they're very much into sporting <noise> and, F uh, D you know, <talking> as far as hunting and also D like, F uh, clay pigeons things like that. C So they have may have some shotguns. They may have other type of, F uh, hunting type things, C but I figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun <laughter> out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, A you know what I'm saying versus a, D you know, a small handgun, F uh, that can be, D you know, put right in your coat pocket C and nobody would see it, C but yet, you can't stop people from having, D you know, a handgun in their home. Even if there are small children around, there's, D you know, you can't say people with small children can't have guns <talking> and people without small children that may have grandchildren, D you know still have these guns C but F uh, I guess I, I was always taught, number one, <noise> a gun isn't a toy. F Uh, D you know, C and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, D you know C and don't ever play with it. F Uh, C so I don't know if that makes a difference or what C but, Uhhuh. The criminals would get them. E I mean even if they had to go across border to get them. Uhhuh. How to use, D you know, to make sure the guns <talking> are put up as something as F uh, not a toy. Yeah. C Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the, F uh, couch or anything like that C but, F uh, I never had an interest in them, being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill C and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns C and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy C and, of course <talking>, we were quite young C and we went through, F uh, the National Rifle, F uh, Club <talking> C and so we were taught, D you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay, if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly C and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself C but yet have this, <Noise> training so that kids aren't <talking>, D you know, they have to have a certain respect for it. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Sure, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think so an, C and I don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what <talking>, <Noise>. <Noise>. Uhhuh. <Clanging> F Uh, that's pro, I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think. F Uh, I definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and F uh, hunting rifles and <clanging> possible handguns for people who use them to, Right. C And, C but I think the, I think semiautomatic weapons, people say <clanging> they use them because it, for sport. C But I, I personally cannot see any use for them other than, F uh, for, for, D like people who dislike have some sort of crazed D you know, ambition to use, have high powered weapons or something. Right. C And E I mean, you can only, how much do you wa, <Clanging> Uhhuh. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Right, yeah. Yeah, that's true. <Clanging>. Right. <Clanging>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. <Clanging>. Right. Uhhuh. <Clanging> Right. D Well, I think par, F uh, in that ca, I think that cases like that it's definitely, F um, I think if you're <clanging> to say okay, we have to get rid of them all because D you know, they can only, they only seem to do bad, <dishes> it, it's, F uh, it's saying we're t, Right, right. C And people who, people who have them and are responsible with them are, are, are being punished C and people who C and they're saying that <clanging> people you cannot take care of things yourself or D like that you're <clanging> not smart enough to teach your kids how to, how to, F uh,. Right. Right <clanging>. Uhhuh. Right. <Clanging>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. <Clanging>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Clanging>. Right. D Well I think, E I mean we, I grew up in a family C and, C and my father had two guns C because he used to hunt years ago C but he stopped before, really before I was old enough to remember. C But, C and I knew we had the guns in the house C and, th, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time <clanging> C but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor I never, E I mean none of us ever thought D well let's go look at the gun C or let's go get the gun it was just something you knew was there C and th, it was your father's C and y, you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all C and I think maybe, F uh, C and that's the type of, the thing that should be, D you know, stressed.
