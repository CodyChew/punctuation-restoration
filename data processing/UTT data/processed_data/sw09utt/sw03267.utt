Wondering how you keep up on the news. Uhhuh. I guess the, I get the WASHINGTON POST C and that is a pretty big newspaper C and I think that's almost exclusive me, ly my first of the news. Though I have the radio on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits, <laughter> C because I'm not going right on the hour. You know. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Right. I think that, D you know, we, we've resolved the issue C and that's what we were asked to do. Right. Right. F Oh, okay. D Well, thanks for discussing it. Byebye. Primarily with our local newspaper and T V. I listen to the radio but not, F um, not like I did when I was working. I am recently retired <noise> to that means I have a lot of time to watch the news on T V. How do you gain your news? <<Very faint>> Okay. F Oh, I see. D Well, that's, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and, and radio. If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then you lose out on an awful lot. D Well, what is your newspaper? That is the WASHINGTON POST is that correct? I have read that when we were in that area, C and it is a splendid newspaper. D So, what more do we need to discuss <laughter>, tonight? That seems like a very short one. D Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have, C but, F uh, I feel that that's not part of our responsibility. D So thank you for calling. All right. Goodbye.
