F Uh, why don't you go ahead first. Sure. Uhhuh. Sure. That's kind of, F uh, to what we're doing is budgeting, D you know. Month to month is, F uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra C so that's kind of how we do it, F uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever. F Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, F uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans F uh, that kind of, D you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff C so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck C and you have to try and take out some of that money. You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month C so, F uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, F uh, it's automatically taken out. C So, F uh, that works out much better for us, C so that's kind of how we do it anyway C but, D E, exactly C and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either. C So that kind of works out where you get into, F uh, some plans that, D you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing, C so it leads you to kind of say D well I'm not going to take it out. I'm going to keep it and, F uh, <child_talking> keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money <laughter>, left. Let's hope anyway, C so you'll have that C so that's kind of how we do it. C But ours is more like month to month too, F uh, short term is, to get things going C so. D Anyway, other than that, F uh, is kind of how we do it C so. I don't know if we're, our time is up or what <laughter>. They'll let us know <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, definitely, definitely. C And, F uh, it grows, F uh, it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return C but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better C and, F uh, C so, D you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way C and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do. Automatic, D you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it. C And, F uh, D you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent. It's put into our savings account C and we don't see it, then it works out to where, D you know, you don't look at it, you just look at the checking account, and say this is what we have for money C and that's it, C so <child_talking>. Yeah, it, it's easy because you do spend it, that's for sure. Like I said, D you know, you kind of look at it, F uh, you better have some other way of, F uh, savings, D otherwise, F uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, D you know, long term type of planning, C so. C And you don't get a good return on it anyway, C so, other, Exactly. Right now. Yeah, it's a bad time, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly, exactly. D You know, we have some inlaws, F uh, that, F uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, F uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low C but, F uh, yeah, it's, it drops C so your better bet is to, F uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, F uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever C so or some kind of profit sharing C so. Sure. Yeah, that's great, yeah <child_talking>. Okay. Yeah, exactly <laughter>. Okay. F Uh, short term, F uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over C so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, F uh extra to go around. F Uh, long term is <sigh> something we're starting <sigh> to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, F uh, <noise> A gee, she's eight now so I guess about ten years. Good heavens. C So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement. C But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it. How about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. And the old, F uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, F uh, idea <laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. F Uh, they'll, F uh <laughter>, Yeah, exactly. We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K. I just wish I could afford to, F uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way, <Noise>. Right. Yeah. <Noise>. Yeah, checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced. Yeah, I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days. Yeah, the interest is so low. E I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes C but for older people who have money in C D s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever. Yeah, I'm, I'm with a small company now C and I hope that, F uh, if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice. D Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here.
