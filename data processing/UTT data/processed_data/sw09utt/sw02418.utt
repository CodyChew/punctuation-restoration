Get us going. Are, are you at T I Austin C or, F Oh, that's great. No, F uh, F uh, my daughter has talked to, my daughter up here with us, I have another one, C and she's talked to students, F uh, D so I guess they have, F uh, sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things. D So they're, if you're a computer user, D so my daughter has talked to two students, F uh, that were non, T I ers. D So I guess, F Oh, yeah. W, we're on finances, have you, have you retired C or, F uh, Oh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah, it's, F uh, that's, the finances, I guess we're on the subject of finances, it is tough. F Uh, I've been with T I, I'm just going to be fifteen years this year C and, C and that's a tough thing, F uh, the salary thing. T I doesn't quite always do it right. D Well, what about our, our, our financial budget. D Well, you, you should have a lot of information on a budget, then, if you're, F uh, D Well, you, you, you deserve an honor for that, a gold star for that, I guess <laughter>. Right, D sure. D Well, I guess I do, I do have a longterm budget bec, I got a daughter in college and one going to be in college C so that, I've been thinking about that for quite a while. D Now mo, monthly, no. I'll tell you a funny story about budgeting, C and <swallowing> I've been married twentysix years C and I did, D you know, that the macho thing, the man always did the bills for, I don't know, fifteen years or more, C and I got so sick of it, trying to balance the budget, F uh, one, C and I always tried to show my wife, D you know, here's how you, once a year I'd say, here's how you do the budget in case I get sick, C or here's how you do the checks, D you know. One day I gave her the checkbook C and I said, I'm not doing this anymore. You do it, you learn it, C and I've been happy ever since. She does it all now for about ten years, C and I don't even, she complains to me about it, she threatens me to give it back to me, C and I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't, fooled with that checkbook, D you know <laughter>. D So I know it's a big pain to try to do that. Right. Right, F oh, yeah. Yes, I think, F uh, that that is a tough, F uh, we all, seems to th, seems to be that way. Yeah. Yeah, that's, you need to do that. I'll, I'll, I'll give you a hint. I don't know if you're a ta, a radio talk, F uh, person listener. Do you listen to radio talk shows? Listen to Bruce Williams, F uh, for financial advice. He's on, F oh, I don't know what he's going to be in Austin. He's on five seventy here. Inter, F oh, he's nationally famous. He's a college graduate type guy. He's been in all, he's an entrepreneur C and he gives very practical financial advice about cars, very, D you know, not, not nothing college level, basic stuff. His name is Bruce Williams, he's on national radio. F Uh, I don't know, what it would be down there. You might want to, whatever your radio talk shows are down there, he's on that channel. It's, F uh, it's five seventy up here. C And I'd listen to talk shows for everything, for gardening and everything, just when I'm doing chores, C and, F uh, he gives a wealth of information, very practical stuff C and, C and he will help you avoid a lot of little things, F uh, financially. Yeah, there, there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget. C And I, I'm not expert, again, because, I don't really do it monthly. Right. I did start a college fund. I'm not, F uh, I have one again at U T down there now, her first year, C and she's almost gone through her whole college fund, D you know <laughter>. D Sure, go ahead. D Sure. F Oh, no, yeah, right, they give us ten minutes, F uh. F Uh, the only advice I give you on college would be, there's a lot of scholarship money out there. My daughter got a little bit, not much, only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth, C and you ought to, D well, as your daughters approach the college age, F uh, start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there C and, F uh, F Uh, band. She got, D you know, five hundred dollars at a, at a clip through bands, through leadership. F Uh, there's all kinds of civic organ, organizations that will give you, D you know, one shot money. F Uh, you get a president's award if you're, you're in, in high school doing cer, this up by, here in Arlington. F Uh, there's a lot of, C and, of course, you, if you, you score high on the S A T, you can get, D you know, two thousand a year, D you know, or more. You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades. She, she did very well in school C and, F uh, C but she only got first year money. She got about two thousand dollars. It was only five hundred, dollars at a clip from this organization. We called. There were, there were two or three people, there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away C and only two or three people applied. She applied and got five hundred dollars from that. D So, look into that bit, The year that they graduate, D you know, before, though, D you know, while they're graduating, there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away, churches and everything, C and they don't even have a dozen applicants because, F uh, F uh, the kids are going off after the big money. F Uh, of course, you have to have some sort of record in high school, F uh, of, of achievement and everything, C but sometimes it's just, F uh, D like our band gave money away. We're a band booster club. We gave, we give, F uh, two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids, F uh, who we think were worthy, D you know D so, There's money out there. Go ahead, you can talk. I, I don't want to, I want to chew up the whole line D here. F Oh, I'm an engineer. I'm, F uh, in fact, I'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything. F Uh, my job, there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved C and so they put me on nights. I, I call this my recession job. C And I'm working nights just kind of covering, F uh, shutdown equipment and everything, and just being available, here. I don't mind. F Uh, it beats being laid off and everything. C And, F uh, you, you got to be a little flexible. F Uh, in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school C and then I'd like to teach, maybe mathematics or something. I'm trying to study for that now. Right, F uh, Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Right. F Oh, sure. D Well, it's tough right now for everybody. <<Background voices>> Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful. F Hey, I've got another clue for you for college. Another clue for you for college money. Go to work for U T. F Uh, we have a friend who works, who is a secretary for T C U, D you know, up here? They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, if you're, if you work for T C U. Yes. D So check that one out, D you know. Ask them about it. Call them. C And, C because it's full, full scholarship. D Now, it's, F uh, not room and board, C but it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U. C And her, her mother went over there just for that... Okay. D Well, I left T I in January C but I signed up for this before I did. F Oh, I think that's a, that's a good idea. All right. F Oh, no, no, no, no <laughter>. D Actually I left T I, F um, had basically set my sights to leave T I when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninetyone, because I, I def, definitely need to make a little more money, C and, F uh, I haven't really accomplished that yet, C but I'm trying. I wish I did. I, I hope you're, you're a person who does things better than, I, I don't have a budget. That's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good, F oh, longrange planning budget mode. F Um, I'm a single mom C and I've been just, F uh, trying to get, <Laughter> Thank you, it's nice to have someone understand that. H, how about yourself, do you have a budget you live by? Uhhuh. Right. D Well, that's great. How about your, . <Laughter>. <Laughter> Oh. It really is. It, it really is. D You know, that was always a, a major problem in our marriage. What I have always identified is I am basically good with money. It, I don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it. I, think that comes from never having enough. D You know, I'm always afraid of <laughter> <breathing> I'm going to need some and where will it be. D So, F um, no, I, I've, I've finally worked myself into a spot where I can budget. When I, when I was first divorced, I had, F um, I sat down and budgeted C and I had outgo that was wha, much higher than what I had coming in. I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me, C and, C and so now that I've gotten, D you know, A I lost the house. Now that I've gotten past that, I can sit down and say, okay, this is the reality. This is how much money I have each month. The scary thing is, as far as long term, I don't have anything. I don't know if you have an I R A or, F uh, D you know, C and I've got two girls, also, C and I haven't saved anything for their college C and, Sometimes I have. Uhhuh. <Doorbell>. D Well, I'll check that out. Uhhuh. You've learned a lot. D Well, that's, that's good to know how, Uhhuh. D Well, you must have done something. You're, you're helping your children in school C and you're D you know. Uhhuh. <Doorbell> <breathing>. Excuse me, Jim, could you hold on? I have someone at the door. I'll be right back. <<Long pause>> <<Voices in background>> Thank you. I think we might have just screwed up the computer C but we'll find out. Oh. C And, C and how did your daughter get scholarship money on? Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. Wow, F oh, I'm definitely going to be actively looking into that. Uhhuh. D Well, that's great to know. Yeah, that's good. F Oh, D well, you're doing, you're doing just fine, C and, C and, F uh, D actually I, when I talk I usually like to ask a lot of questions. I was wondering what you do at T I. F Oh, goodness. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, absolutely. Yeah. F Oh, I hope you can do that. What, what I did is I was approached C and, C and I've, I went to T I just right at the time that, F uh, my marriage was ending. I had been a, a stay at home mom C and, C and I, I mo, was very fortunate in starting, C and I really enjoyed it while I was at T I, C but, D you know, the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening C and I had less than five years C and, also, I wanted to make a little bit more money. C So I decided I'd like to go out and try sales. C And, F uh, I'm, I'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses. C And the potential there is fantastic. The reality of it is it's tough <laughter>. <<Background voices.>> Exactly. Uhhuh. Okay. Yes. They do? I'm going to check that. I've got, I've got two friends that work at, at U T. I didn't know that all. Definitely, I will. Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds fantastic. <<Background voices.>>
