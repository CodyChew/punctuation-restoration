Okay. D Well, I heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <noise>. The same way here in Dennison. E I mean, F uh, back a couple weeks ago they found, F uh, some people I don't remember at some fast food restaurant. They had been, I can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer C but I'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast, food restaurant. C And I've worked, worked in fast food restaurants. They don't have that much money on hand, they really don't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager. C And he, D well I don't know, he decided not to work one night or something C and one of the guys that was working was shot, C and, Kenny quit the next day. He just, he couldn't deal with it. Uhhuh. Everywhere. Uhhuh. It just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though, the worst part of it. F Um, I lived in Louisville, Kentucky for a while, C but, I lived on the outskirts too, C but Louisville was pretty bad especially during D like the, F uh, Kentucky Derby. At this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville. C But, F uh. Uhhuh. The ones that blink off and on. By themselves I mean. Right. Uhhuh. How many kids do you have? Oh a boy or? F Oh, that's what I've got, It is scary, are your ba, are they babies or, F Oh, D well good. That they're a comfort to you. I've still got babies. Okay <laughter>. I've got a, a four year old. A He'll be four. And a three month old. C And it's scary <laughter>, sometimes. I'm used to living in, F uh, which we don't live in the city, C but we just. It's still more crowded than what I'm used to, I'm used to having, D you know, eight or ten houses on one street C and this one's got houses on either side and, D you know, real close together, and just, <Throat_clearing>. Right. F Oh, F oh D well, we think our neighbors are stealing from us, D actually my husband. They, F uh, D well, the one of them's a teenager that lives next door C and her friends are pretty wild. They've stolen gas out of our vehicles. C And so he went and got a locking gas cap for his. They weren't stealing it out of mine so much, because my car, the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to, syphon gas out. C So he, he went and got a locking cap C and they cu, tried to break that off. C And you <throat_clearing>, E excuse me. He went down to Uba, and noticed that it was hanging off where, where they had tried to break it off. C And they stole our tailgate off his truck <laughter>. D Well, we can't say they did C but, We're pretty, yeah, it had to be somebody that, D you know, could do it in the middle of the night C and, D you know, they'd seen it earlier. Uhhuh. D Well, the only thing that we can do as citizens is, D you know, like, F uh, watch groups that they'll have. . C But they can be dangerous too. I've thought about it. D You know, that <<pause>> this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I watched it on T V, F oh, I guess last year sometime. They'll break in at the day, in the daytime, C and, I hear that, D you know, it's if you lock yourself out of your house C and you try to get in your house it will you give that half the time it takes you to break in. F Uh, a professional could break in, in, half that time. Yeah. It is. Uhhuh. I'm getting me, F uh, I want a German Shepherd. F Um, I don't want any of those ones that will up the kids, C but I do want a German Shepherd. C Because my husband will leave every once in a while, for, he works on the railroad. C And I'm scared here by myself. And loud. Uhhuh. The Cocker Spaniels are loud <laughter>. D Well that's, D now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog. That's a deterrent. Because they know that that dog's going to bark. C But it's easy to fool a dog too. D you know, throw them meat or F um, a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat. From what I've he, D you know, <laughter> saw it on T V. Yeah, it was. C And I, maybe we'll meet up again. All righty. Byebye. D Well, D you know, D you know last night I was listening to the, F uh, ten o'clock news. C And for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings, the number of drug deals that were going on, and crime C and, C and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I did too. I remember us, I used to work at, F uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken. C And, C and I just couldn't believe, F um, D you know, that now I would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one. And, F uh, because of, F uh, the crime that they would, F um, kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there, F uh, in their cash drawer. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. yeah. F Oh, I understand what your talking about. So, yeah, I have, F uh, F uh, D you know, a real problem, F uh, even though I live further out in the suburbs, the crime follows you anywhere, it, it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this. F Um, C so, C but, I just think about the all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D So, I don't know, F um, D you know, it's asking about what kind of steps we can take, F um, F uh, D you know, just as citizens to try and, F um, F uh, protect ourselves. I know I have, F uh, F um, home security system. C Plus, I have the, F uh, the special lights on, on the outside. C And I have, Yeah, that, F uh, yeah, yeah. By themselves if you if there's some kind of movement, then they'll automatically come on. F Um, C but, E I mean it's just I'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected, verses, F um, Two. Two. One of each. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. No, no, there teenagers now. Yeah <laughter>. F Oh, wow. Yeah. That's a problem. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's different, yeah, living down here. Now, now the nice thing, F uh, I feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this. F Um, I, I feel like that there's going to be, F uh, less crime C or your neighbors going to be watching out for you, F um, because it's, it's practically, it's in their backyard, too, F Oh goodness. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh my goodness. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh goodness. Someone did, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah I know that it's a real problem. It doesn't matter where you are anymore. It's, F uh, more of a matter of what you, the steps that you do to keep yourself safe, C and F um, C so that's, that's why I try and, F uh, do, Uhhuh, uhhuh. Really. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D You know, I was going home the other day C and I saw, F um, a guy who, who looked like he was breaking into a window, C and I thought, gee whiz, D you know, I don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's, th, he's the person who lives there. F Uh, D you know, C and, C and I was thinking D well, I need to call the police when I get back home C and C because it was about F oh about four or five blocks from where we live C and, F uh, C and I thought no, D you know, because I wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight. C But anymore, D you know, the crime happens in daylight, as it does in, in night, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Half that time, wow. I mean that's so scary. So scary you, you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe, C and, C and, F uh, somebody could break in, F uh, F oh I have a dog, that's the one thing that I like. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh yeah. F Oh yeah. C So that's ano, F uh, we have a little dog now C but he is just as vicious as is, D you know, if you, bu, And loud, yeah, <laughter> C and I thought that, F uh, D you know, we'd have to have a big dog C but we doesn't need a big dog. We got this little bitty dog that, F uh, part Dachshunds C and part Cocker Spaniel. C And he, F um, ease very protective, yeah. Very protective, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. F Oh, wow, gosh. D Well, it was nice talking to you. Okay. Okay. Byebye.
