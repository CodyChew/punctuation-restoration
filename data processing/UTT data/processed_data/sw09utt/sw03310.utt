Okay. Have you faced, F uh, elderly care yet, F uh, nursing home care for any of your parents? Uhhuh. Yes. I think sooner or later, F uh, both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes C and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in. C And, uhhuh. C And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life. I, that, it just, D you know, it's absolutely devastating. What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes? Yes <laughter>. F Um, uhhuh. Yes. Yes. No, F uh, there, D well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my motherinlaw. C And, F uh, theirs both ran, F oh, I think my motherinlaw's was D like fifteen hundred C and my mother's was two thousand. Then, this has been five years ago. C And, F uh F uh, one of the things that, D you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if, when I started out with my motherinlaw, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours C and they knew. C And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, D you know, they did a little bit, they did better. D You know, uhhuh. C And, D you know, a couple of times with my motherinlaw, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, D you know, would have to rate, C so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, D you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would, C and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, F uh, we had my mother all set to go into one C and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors. C And, I saw areas that they had not shown me C and they did not come across as well as, D you know, what they had originally shown me, C so, F uh, we did not put her in that one. We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, D you know, was much, F uh, better pleased with the situation. Yes, you do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Does your mother have Alzheimer's? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Did she know that she was going to a nursing home? Did she know that she was going to a nursing home? Uhhuh. Unfortunately, yes. F Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, F uh, my three brothers and our wives C and we were talking, F uh, we had a <breathing> review with the nursing home staff. My mother's in a nursing home. C And, F uh, we had a review today C and a few things we had to do that <breathing>, are part of it that you don't really like, D like, F uh <breathing>, making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing, C so, yes, I'm very familiar with it C and it's not <laughter> something that is, F uh, D you know, I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience. C But I guess we all do. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Right. D Well, <breathing> they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true. F Uh, we've, D you know, we've looked around C and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area <breathing>. C And the one she is in now, F uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like. C But, D again, it's no different than every one. And, D you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, D well, even not as much care. It's not that expensive, really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, I'll be darned. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, you, D you know, this is the whole point. You've got, you've got to shop them. I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's C and, F uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric. F Uh, the fact that these people are <breathing>, they're up and around, C but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type s, situation. C And it's very, very, <Lipsmack> <breathing> She, D well, who knows. They call it, F uh, dementia. C And, F uh, we don't know. I, I mean she does not know us anymore C and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows, C but it's, basically the same. C And her health is not that bad. Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last, D well, she had been in a retirement community C and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children. D Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her. C And, F uh, C but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in, C and she's been in the nursing home now for, <breathing> F oh, I would say about three months. C And, I'm sorry? She, no, as far as she knew, she was going to a hospital. And that she could, she could handle a hospital C and we says, you know, mom, if you, D you know, if you get a, you get better, A you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, D you know, if you get better that you could come out.
