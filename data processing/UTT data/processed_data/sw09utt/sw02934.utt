D Well, the last three days it's been pretty rainy. We went to the beach C and, F uh, it started, F uh, let's see, around four o'clock, C and, F uh, it had thunder and lightning, it was, C and then, D you know, it was just overcast and rainy for, F uh, the next two or three days straight. How about yours? Uhhuh. You're from Virginia? F Oh, from Texas. I heard they had some flooding down there. Uhhuh. F Um. Uhhuh. D Well, the last couple of years, we're, F um, we're over as far as our rainfall goes. Before that it was really dry, C and, F uh, everybody was, D you know, talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that. Not really rationing water, but just cutting down. C And, F uh, it seems like, F uh, D you know, the weather pattern is just shifting, and, F uh, that, F uh, jet stream is moving, F uh, into our area, North Carolina and across, C but it's, F uh, changing latitude. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. It's finally cleared up. It's just now st, still a little overcast, C but the s, C but the sun has finally started popping out. F Oh yeah, D well, right now, as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis. It's, F um, I'd say it's at least seventynine, eighty, D well, about seventyeight, seventynine degrees. F Um, D actually the, F uh, the wind normally blows, let's see, A let me think about this, south, southwest. Yeah, F uh, C but a, C but D actually our, I guess our weather pattern comes from the, F uh, blows north east, yeah you're right, it blows north east. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. How f, how far are you from Houston? F Oh, I see, C so you, C so you don't hav, you don't get anything off the Gulf, F uh, immediately from, from the ocean. Uhhuh. F Um. D Well, we've had some, D you know, pretty, pretty rough winds. F Oh, F uh, Bangle, Bangladesh, boy, they, they caught it bad <laughter>. C But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes. I know, F uh, Hurricane Hugo, you probably heard about that. F Uh, last year. Yeah, C and they're still, F uh, <throat_clearing> rebuilding from that storm, C and so the, the beaches here just get really beat up <<pause>> C and it usually comes this way <laughter>. It comes up from, F uh, Miami F uh, down around, E or, D you know, around the Bahamas, C and it usually travels, F uh, northwest, C and, F uh, it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits. F Um, let's see, two years ago we had one, as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house. C And, F um, it was real odd. The m, barometric pressure drops during a tornado, C and our, F uh, fire alarm went off. C So of course that woke everybody up, C and we knew what was going on, to, F uh, D you know, go downstairs or go into the bedro, bathroom and, F uh, take cover. C But, F uh, we get, F uh, yeah, we're, we're, F uh, we get our share of tornados. No, huhuh. We're about two hours from the beach. C So, F uh, D you know, it's, F uh, barometric pressure I believe is higher in the mountains, C and we cat, we catch some winds, D you know, a few winds coming off of them, I think. C But, F uh, let's see, you all just had a tornado, F uh, over close to Oklahoma and Texas? Uhhuh. F Oh, gosh. F Oh, did it? F Um. F Um. Boy I would have like to have heard that. That cou, would have been something. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I used to live in Amarillo originally. C So I'm, Oh yeah. <laughter> We used to sit out, F uh, especially in Borger, we use to sit out on our back, F uh, picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds C and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground. C But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was, C but the clouds are just really, F uh, F uh, rolling kind of just real pillowy, I guess. F Oh, D well I was in that, F uh, big tornado went through Wichita Falls. C And, F uh, the sky, E I mean, we were right in the middle of it, when, E I mean, signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us. C And a whole roof of a restaurant came off. <laughter> C And, F uh, it was a eerie, F uh, a real eerie bluegreen color. C And the lightning was almost continuous, just, F uh, D you know, as if you put your hand on one of those electric, F uh, things that causes lightning. F Uh, I think it was called the storm. C But, F um, the s, the whole sky was full of that eerie bluegreen, F uh, lightning. F Um. Uhhuh. We haven't got that much rain, C but, F uh, when it rains, it's, it's been downpouring. <Laughter> You, too. Okay, thanks. Bye. Okay. How's the weather been out there? Uhhuh. <Noise> <<Sound like pans rattling>>. It's pretty normal for this year, D you know, F uh, they have tornados about once a week, C and it rains about every three days. The last two years before, they've had record rainfall. By this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year, C but this time we're only, F um, I think, maybe five inches ahead of, of, F uh, normal. C So it's not been bad at all. I'm from Texas. Uhhuh. C And, F uh <throat_clearing>, F Um, they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad over, I think it was over the weekend. The radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it. <Noise> <<pans rattling>>. Yeah, that's, that's right. There y, Uhhuh, C so you get a lot more rain that way. Uhhuh. <<pause>> Brings in that cold air C and mixes it with the, with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean. That's what, Uhhuh. Is the temperature D like sixty, sixties to eighties there too, C or, F Um, do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's the way it does here most of the time. C But, F uh, sometimes it just comes straight from the north C and then it, C and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston, or, or, F uh, maybe mid, midTexas depends on how strong the cold fronts are. F Um, D well, F uh, Richardson's a suburb of Dallas. Hardly ever, unless there's a hurricane or something like that. D Well, F uh, it's kind of early f, I was going to say, the weather man on, on, F uh, one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather, C and he was afraid if it kept doing that, that they'd have er, early hurricanes this year. Yeah. Kind of wiped them ou, Uhhuh. Wiped everything out. Yeah. Uhhuh. Do y, do you get many tornados this time of year C or, F Um. F Huh. Right. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, the, F uh, F uh, you, you aren't in the mountains or anything like that, are you? There's just hil, there's just hills. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, they, they had a lot of them. They had a, a huge one that was on, F um, INSIDE EDITION the other night, in, F uh, the southern part of Kansas. F Um, they took a bunch of film of it. It, F uh, kind of chased them. It was a few hundred yards away C and it chased them under an underpass, C and it was tossing around the car right before it got there, C and it tore up the people inside the car. C And the n, the camera man on the news crew held the camera out, they were hiding underneath the underpass, C and he held the camera out as the tornado went by. C And y, the, the wind, D you know, it had a mike on it, C and the wind and everything was incredible. I'm surprised they didn't, they, because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row C and that, C and you know, C and that was way up in Kansas. C But over here, it's a lot, it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them. Yeah you can really see them well there. Yeah. It's really strange the way it does that. Especially the way it starts. It starts, D you know, just like a little swirl in the clouds, C and, C and, F uh, then it just grows from there. C And it, C and, C and usually it's not even raining when it starts. It's just. Uhhuh. That's right, C and they're black, C and sometimes they're even green colored. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's it. Wow. <<pause>> C And that's about, that's what we get this time of year, just, all the way, sometimes all the way through June, the last, especially the last two years, it's rained, F uh, D what, I think it rained nine inches in, in one, one of the Junes the last two years. C And this year, u, we usually get about five inches in May, C and it's, it's over that. Uhhuh. <<pause>> All right, D well I hope you have good weather the rest of the summer. Have fun playing tennis. Byebye.
