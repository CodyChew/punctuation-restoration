Are you ready to start? Okay <throat_clearing>. D Well, I just found out that my car <<talks like an old woman>> was thirty months old, C and it doesn't <laughter> seem like it's that old. Seems like I just bought it. It's an eightynine C and I bought it, F uh, in, F uh, eightyeight C so, yeah. I know, I really will do that the next time, I buy it too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's wonderful. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. F Huh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Sure. Right. Uhhuh. C But do you feel though, F uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities? Is that how you, I have never, Its re, Isn't that a shame. My word isn't that sorry. That's sorry. My word. F Oh, mercy. You, F Huh. F Huh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Sure. No thanks. That's right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Wow. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Who makes that car? E I mean C but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is it, F uh, Asian or is it European C or who, F Oh, it is Japanese. Okay, I didn't know. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Okay <laughter>. Yeah, I guess so that's true. Yeah. If, if, if I had the car I wanted. Gee. Probably, F um, F uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car <laughter>. C But I, I don't know the performance of it. That's a, Ford product, C and, D you know, I would get hung up by my boot straps if I ra, if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Can I put you on hold for one minute? Thank you. <<pause>> D Well, that was one minute. They hung up. <Laughter>. F Um, D well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. F Um, and the luxuries of a large car. F Uh, D now color preferences, I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. <Laughter>. Right, D well, practical yes that's, Uhhuh. Right C and it's cooler I believe, too, when you're driving in, Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Oh. F Um, can you, F uh, hang on again hon, Thanks <<pause>>. I've got the phones for lunch hour. <Laughter> D So. Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth. F Um, D so you like to listen to, F uh, a lot of music, C or do, is it talk shows. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. All the, yeah. Uhhuh. That's true. Do you listen t, Do you lik, listen to W R R? F Huh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Those are nice, aren't they? Yes, those are nice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Yes. Have you recently bought a new car Catherine? Oh. F Oh, wow. D Well, I really, I, the last car we got was a, was a used car. I really don't prefer buying a new car. I like to let somebody else pay for that <laughter>. C But, F uh mine was a year old, C and we bought it for very functional purposes, C and that was we bought a station wagon. We wanted an economical car to operate, C but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment. C So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon. C And I've never been sorry, however the need for that kind of car has changed now, C and, F uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable. And probably then some <laughter>. I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up. I think that I would like to, if I, D you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted I would C either buy a Nissan Maxima, F uh, I'm sold on Nissans. I a or, or foreign cars D actually. F Uh, F Uh, its reliability. Its reliability. C And, F uh, I, D you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things, C and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars. If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford. C But I had, F uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it. F Uh, D you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard. C And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car. D So, C and that was just trying to hold us, getting out of that was a used car. C And it was an older car, C but, D you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales. C But it's just, it just was not deliv, C and you get stung a time or two, C and you say, no thanks. C So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, F uh, reports inst, had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly, C and he gave me four choices of cars to buy <laughter>. An Escort definitely was not among them. In fact, there wasn't an American car in there. F Uh, the Nissan came C and, C and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get. C But it served our needs. F Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, F uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area, in the class that we were looking for. C And that, C and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac. I really would. It's not necessarily prestige, C but it's comfort. F Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. F Uh, Nissan. M, No. No, no. Nissan is Japanese. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. C And, F uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car <laughter>. E I mean, D you know, every othe, every one of us have two sides <laughter>. Yeah. Now what about you, if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get C and why? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. See there, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made. Really was. C And, F uh, I, I really have not seen, D now a lot of the American cars actually are, are, parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa. Of course. Okay <laughter>. F Uh, at any rate do you have color preferences C or what would be the features that you would be looking for? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, wow. <laughter> We like the stuff that glitters <laughter>. Good. There's nothing wrong with that. D Actually I think probably if I were going to get a, if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be, I would prefer white. Because, simply because it's more visible at night. C And, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Now the interior, okay, I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red. <Laughter> C But if I had the little red C R X, I guess the interior would have to be black leather C and I'd have to live with that. C And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too. I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. That's okay. No, no, no. I generally would p, F uh, prefer to listen to, F uh, D well, I listen to K C B I a lot C but I will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work. C But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time, I want some real good classical music. I love classical music, C and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the, all the characteristics of the instruments. C So I do love classical music C or it li, C or, C or, F uh, contemporary classical. Uhhuh. Sure do. W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to, more than anything else. C And I do like them. C And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car. That would be, something that I would really like. Those compact discs, really are good for cars because they don't melt, they don't warp. D You know, <laughter> there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, F uh, rollers or anything. It seems like a really good answer to portable music, that you can choose.
