Okay, let's talk about schooling. Okay, D well, I have a boy C and he just went into middle school, C and I have a girl, C and she's in, F uh, grade school, C and then I have a little boy who goes to, F uh, they have something just before kindergarten, C and it's called Early Childhood, C and I have a young a young boy in that. C So I, I have a lot of children in, in the school system down here. C And, F um, I think we have excellent teachers here. I am really, F uh, D like the stu, D like the way the teachers work with the students. F Uh, I've not been so, F um, happy with the schools <laughter> themselves, I guess. D Like, my, last year, my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school, C and it was just packed. E I mean, it was a, a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents. C And it was just a real problem. F Uh, C so we had to do a bond issue and, and, F um, vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do, or to, F uh, work on the, work for another school to be built, which is a good idea, C but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it. C So, F um, I think one thing is that would, maybe we don't have enough schools, C and secondly, when we have enough schools, sometimes we can't get the, the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh, great. We see through the, out the country. Uhhuh. I think that's right. Yeah <laughter>. The home, yeah. I think that's right. It is so hard with a family system, F um, either divorced or, or just one parent or just li, C and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a, a hard situation for the children, F uh, to, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them C and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school, F um I think what you said is, is really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school D so, F um, what about your wife, is she, she happy at school C or <laughter>. I bet she does. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, right. Uhhuh. Yeah, Right. Yeah. F Uh, what, what contacts do you have with the public school sy, F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I think that's, I think that's, F uh, true. I, I've got a little different, F uh, contact, C but I've, I've got a, one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a, a sophomore this year C and, F uh, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson. F Uh, C but, in general, I, I think the, the, D you know, one of the reasons that we, we, F uh, the, chose to live in Richardson when we, when we came here was the, was the schools, C and I think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the, F uh, things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent th, that F uh, right, right. C And I think, I think part of that is that, is the, the, F uh, a big part of that is just the demographics, the population in those schools are, are, typically, F uh, people that very much value the education and support the, the school systems C and, C and, F uh, although there's still some, still some problems, C but, F uh, I, D you know, I, when I was, when I was going to school, I grew up in Iowa, C and, C and, in my family, school was certainly valued, C but if there was ever any sort of a, F uh, if ev, if I was ever in trouble in school, I was also in trouble at home even more so, C and I think that part of it is, is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, F uh the culture that doesn't, doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, F uh what the schools are, are trying to do. Yeah, that's true. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, F uh, she, she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher. She has, she has two half day classes. C So she has, F uh, D you know, on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades C and F uh, F uh, C but her, her background is in, is in, F uh, child development, and and, F uh, so forth, C and so kindergarten is as high as she, as she wants to teach, C and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that, that, that's the jobs that are available and that, the schedule matches, F uh, D you know, with our kids and things like that. C So, yeah, F uh, C and, C but, F uh, the...
