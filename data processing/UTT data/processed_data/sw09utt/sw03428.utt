Okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why? Yes, true. Right. Yeah, I can, I can understand that. I was raised in Oklahoma, C and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, F uh, yeah, the hunting and everything, C and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all, C and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it, C but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs. Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing. C But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight <laughter>. D Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, D you know, your urban areas, C and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, C and of course it was definitely there. C So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. It's, D you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, F uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. I don't know what the answer is. I know that it's scary, C and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, C and that's basically what the gun control would end up being. D Well, it's very true. It's not the law abiding citizen that, D you know, is, is dangerous with the gun <laughter>. It's the ones that are going out and stealing it. C And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. C And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too. E I mean, they'd have to be almost worldwide, which we know would never ever happen. C Because even if you said, okay, D you know, armed forces could have them, some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck. That's very true <laughter> very true. Who knows, we maybe want to overthrow the government <laughter>. <Laughter> I know, if somebody doesn't do something. F Uh, what about, F uh, what do you think of this, this, F uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, F uh, carry the gun, or buy, D you know, actually purchase the gun? Yes. D Well, I guess I stand on, F uh, on, probably ten for no, F uh, restrictions. I, F uh, recently just moved to Texas from, F uh, South Dakota and Nebraska, C and <inhaling> I guess in terms of gun control I've always, F uh, been raised with the, F uh, idea in the Constitution that, F uh, citizens had a right to bear arms, C and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, F uh, more, F uh, of a national defense, F uh, than anything else, C but, F uh, on the other hand, too, F uh, people then, F uh, needed to use firearms for, F um, survival in terms of, F uh, food C and, F uh, I was raised, F uh, D you know, hunting all the time, I lived on the farm, and, F uh, D you know, enjoy hunting C and I guess I have, F uh, some problems with, F uh, being restricted to, F um, owning a gun for, D you know, hunting purposes mainly. C And, F um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, F um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more. <Laughter> Yeah, it, F uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, C but, F uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, F uh, in the midwest and then, F uh, moving to a larger city where there are driveby shootings C and, F uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, C and, F uh. I, I think so, C and, C and there's always the, F uh, the, F uh, the old, F uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one, C and, F uh, C and then, F uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. Yeah, C and, F uh, C and, D you know, F uh, I suppose, F uh, years ago, way back when, F uh, when, F uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, F uh, were fed up with the government, F uh, C and if they didn't have a way to, F uh, to fight back <laughter> they would have been in big trouble. <Laughter> D Well, the way things are going. <Laughter>. D Well, D you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, F uh, every gun you ha, bought had to be licensed, I believe. C And, F uh, D you know, that didn't bother me, F uh, too much, C and so, I guess it depends, F um, if there are some statistics that show that, F uh, that people, F uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
