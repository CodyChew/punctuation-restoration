Okay. F Um, we have small children, two and four C and so we, our dining is very limited <laughter>. F Oh, we're past that now. We're a little sick of that <laughter>. <Throat_clearing> No, F um, we're more D like, F um, D you know, D like Wyatt's Cafeteria. Yeah, that way. C And the kids just love everything that's there, C so we're pretty fortunate. Kind of, F um, buffet style, F uh, C so you can go in and go out C and the food's already served C and you don't have to wait, C and it's already in front of them when you sit down, and things like, F um, Souper Salads, D you know, it's, D again it's buffet, C and it's already prepared and just things, any, any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time. <Laughter> We, No <laughter>. We tried a Bennigan's one time, C and it was terrible. Course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway. We, we waited almost <breathing> fortyfive minutes before everything was brought out, C and it was, we were ready to go home. Yeah. No <laughter>. We fought with them <laughter> for fortyfive minutes. C So, we, we, we rarely go eat in those kind of eating, F uh, situations, any more. C But we do love to eat out, C and, F um, C and we do it as often as we can, C and, C and times that we do have babysitters we, we try and catch, F um, some things that we normally wouldn't do, D you know. F Oh, F um, let me see, F uh, for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's. It's, F um, on, on Walnut and Greenville. It's called Uncle Julio's. F Um, basically Mexican food.

F Uh, it's on Campbell. It, it's north of Campbell, but, F uh, off Central, F uh F oh, it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the ba, in the ground floor. I don't know what they call it now, Northern Telecom kind of moved over in their own building. C But it, it's a big, tall, it's the tallest building on the west side, northwest side of Campbell and, just before you get to Campbell C and it's in the lower floor, C but it's really a nice restaurant if you like Continental stuff.
