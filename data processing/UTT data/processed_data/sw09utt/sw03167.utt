They suggested some sort of a recipe, F uh, for, F uh, <lipsmack> company, for entertaining. Did you have anything in mind that, F uh, you'd like to share? Ooh. Oh. Ooh, that sounds good. What, Uhhuh. One tablespoon of worcester? Okay. F Oh, that, How much chili sauce did you say? D Like eight, Not eight ounces. That would be a lot. Is it? Okay, this would make a lot, right? C And how much crab meat did you use? One, One can of flake. F Oh, okay. Have you ever used the, F uh, imitation, yet? Ooh, that sounds, I've tried it C and then I have it here on hand for about a week C and then all of a sudden it dawned on me, wait, is this totally imitation C and then I found out, I went back to the store C and they said it is a fish product. C So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, D you know once you buy it. I thought, D so, D you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is. D You know. F Oh, that's a good idea. Whose was that? , F Uh, Sam's, right, right. Oh. F Oh, that sounds good C because that's great. That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant. Okay, I, I've, Right. F Oh, hey, that sounds, Right. C And it's something good to have on hand, too. It's frozen in the first place, right? C So, you can, F uh, it is frozen, isn't it? C And then you can re freeze. Hey, that sounds great. That s, F Oh, do you? C And that's my favorite. C And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it. <Laughter>. That's the, that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve. I, I said I can make it no time. It's trying to think, C and then we just, F uh, built a new home C and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house C and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you cooking. Which is funny. This, <laughter> D well, this is what everyone has said. They said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen. <Laughter> C And I said, yes, I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality. C But, F uh, what I have learned in the, F uh, ten months we've lived here, is it that when I entertain, I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the, <laughter> everything through, ready to serve. C Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess, like you said. C So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, D you know, right out of the magazine. You're right. C And you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to come, D you know, they'll come in the kitchen C and I said, out, we have the chairs on the other side <laughter> of the counter <laughter> for guests. You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen <laughter>. C And it, it has worked out. C But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining F uh, well enough that they know, D you know, it's very much at home type situation. D Well, we even have a better one. Now we decided <laughter> that we all meet, we have it worked, D Well, I, F uh, just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres. C And I fixed, F uh, a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy. It's, F uh, it's D like, F uh, eight ounces of cream cheese softened, C and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate. C And, Uhhuh. C And then you take and, F uh, <lipsmack> cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers. C And that always goes over real well C and it's real easy. It's one of the small bottles. I don't think, F uh, <Lipsmack> D Well, it's about eight ounces. It, it, uhhuh. Yeah, it would probably make, D well, it doesn't make quite as much as you think, C but, yeah, spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin. One tin. Of the flake. Uhhuh. C And drain it real good. Uhhuh. Yes, I have. I used it, F uh, last Christmastime. F Uh, what did I put it in? I think I just served it by itself. There's D like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Right. Right. That's very true. Very true. I had bought a cheesecake, F uh, C and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen, which I felt was real nice. Yeah. It, F uh, was, F uh, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's. C And I got it, do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there? It's real, Yeah, okay, that's where I picked it up. It comes out of Chicago C and they're very good cheesecakes. Yeah. Yes, yes. C And they have, C and they have the little papers between them. C And I think they're, D what, about nine dollars and something. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, it is frozen. C And I thaw it C and then you can re freeze it. C And, Uhhuh. It was, they're very good, very good. C And that's the one thing that I hate to make is desserts. Is it? F Oh, I love to eat it, C but I don't like to make it. It takes time C and you have to rack your brain, C and, time I don't have anymore <laughter>. Uhhuh. It is. Uhhuh. That's right. And your mess <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Right. Right. That's, that's right. D Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want to, I want to party, too. I don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something <laughter>. D You know. Correct <laughter>. <Laughter> Sounds, Right. D Well, a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples, again, that we've known a long time like you, they, F uh, we all bring things C and it sure makes it a whole lot easier. Anymore.
