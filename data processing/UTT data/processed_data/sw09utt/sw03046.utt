Good morning. My name is Jean. F Oh, where you from Tina? F Oh, Garland, Texas, I'm in Pennsylvania. Really? <laughter>. Do you work for Texas Instruments? Uhhuh. Most of them do. <laughter> D Now, I don't have anybody that works for T I, C but, F uh my son works for a computer company, the National Institute of s, s, something, I don't know what <laughter>. D So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today. Yes, uhhuh. You ready? Okay. F Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that. D Well, I don't know, my brother lives down East of us down there, C and I don't think they ate all that much different <laughter>. <Laughter> F Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods, course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more. F Uh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Right. Yeah, C and it's not as good as if it's fresh. Uhhuh. Is that right? Yeah, D well, they probably were trying to do the best they could. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, D well they do in the summertime, I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly. Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time. C So, F uh, Yeah. C So, I, Is that right? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh Uhhuh. More like covered dishes for those type of dinners. . D Well, I don't know, just about anything <laughter>. Yeah, we, we really, F uh, use most anything. I, F uh, I think D like parties and that though are, D well, D like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party <laughter>. <Laughter> C But, basically, we tried, D you know, included all the basic, F uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal. Your, F uh, bread family and your, or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and, ham and bake potatoes, F uh, F uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from. C And, F uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking, you know they been advertising that C and, we've really been enjoying those, F uh, meals. They have a lot of vegetable to them, C and, F uh, they really are very good. <Laughter> Is he a meat and potato person? D Well, all our family is, is gone. They are out on their own. C And, F uh. It, it's much different C and, F uh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, my husband didn't like that, C so we, us kids, we had five children C and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper, that's what we had <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah. F Oh, those always go good. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh really. D Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going. Uhhuh. Right. <laughter> Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that, C and it is easier to chew. Uhhuh. Right. <laughter> We don't really have, F uh, D you know, entertain too much. I don't know if you do or not, C but we, we don't a whole lot, we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well that's good. Yeah, we do a lot of that take, things to church C and our homemakers meet at the church also, C and, F uh, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that. C So, you don't really include any certain food groups, you just bring, what you like <laughter>. Sometimes you have all desserts, sometimes, you have all vegetables <laughter>. Yeah. C But, it doesn't happen very often, usually you get a pretty wide variety C and you can, you can, have pretty good meals, from one of those. F Oh, those are fun. Uhhuh. F Uh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh , Oh. Was there enough to go around? <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually <laughter>, C and you know they know better. Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook. Right. Right. <Laughter> They said that we could share, we share, a recipe C but, I'm up at my daughter's, I don't even have any of my recipes with me. F Uh, D you know, Oh. F Oh, great. They are ready to go. D Well, we probably, have we talked long enough I, Okay, C so I'll let, F Oh, same here. You have a good day. Uhhuh. Byebye. Hi. I'm Tina. I live in Garland, Texas. F Oh, my lands, <laughter> you're the farthest person I've ever talked to. Yeah. My husband does. Yeah. Probably most people you talk to do, F huh? F Huh. I see, well that's neat. Yeah, I guess you have to push one, though. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I guess so, it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there <laughter>. F Oh, really. Yeah, that's true. D Well, F uh, the thing that I found interesting, my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile C and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing, C and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it <laughter>. Right, C and, C and, F uh, C and, C but here, we eat a lot of D like Mexican foods, C and, F um, <lipsmack> up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me. Yeah, it tasted like they were trying <noise> to do the best they could, C but it just, didn't taste right. Yeah. <Laughter> C and, F uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think. D Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing. Up there, F uh, it was hardly ever heard of C and, we drink ice tea with every meal, C and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea <laughter>. Really? Yeah. Right. Yeah, it never gets real cold. Yeah, C but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular. Yeah. I know that, F um, I do a lot of planning with our church, C and a lot of the times when we get together, D well everybody will bring a Mexican dish C or. C And Italian food is real big too. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. How about you, what is real popular up there? F Oh, really. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's good. Uhhuh, right. F Oh, yes. I, I love that kind of cooking. My, F uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things <laughter>. Right. <laughter> They. Uhhuh. That probably makes it easier, C but. Yeah. We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese C and, F uh, <Laughter> C and of course, Right. Yeah, D well, that's pretty much what we do, if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese, or something. C But, they like, F uh, spaghetti. D You know, that's one meal, I can fix C and the whole family eats. C But, F uh, there are several things that, D well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because. Yeah, the children love them, C and, F uh, they are real easy to cook C and, that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, D well, C and my girls don't like beef, I, don't know, I guess, D Well, yeah, it could be, bec, they don't, I think it's the texture of it, C but it takes more chewing <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. C So they're not too much into beef. My husband and I eat more beef than we should, C but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated. We have a real tiny little house, we don't have room really, to have people here. C But, we do get together for wh, fellowships at our church, C and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that. C And, Yeah, it is C and it's fun to, F uh, I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That's right <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, that's true, <laughter> that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, F uh, like best. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I remember one time we had a progressive dinner. It's the only time that ever. Yeah they are. C But it's the only time tha, I can remember that, I can't remember what food it was I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with. Several people were supposed to bring, D you know, each, D like, F uh, a, an appetizer, and a main dish and a dessert. C And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers C and, C but when we came to the main, main dish plate, there was only D like two or three <laughter>. D Well, not really, you know we all took real tiny little portions, and, F uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was, we were not sure who didn't show up with the food <laughter>. Yes. Right. Right. C Either, C either go ahead and fix your dish C or call someone that can. I know it. D Well, that sounds neat, I can't, F uh, believe you're so far away, C but you sound so close. It sounds like you're here in Dallas. Oh. I don't know if I have anything handy, we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming, C and we're waiting on my sister. Cara, hold on just a second <<to another person in the room>> As a matter of fact, my, little one is hollering <laughter>. I think it probably has been. D So, I've enjoyed talking to you. Thank you. Thanks for calling. Byebye.
