D So, a, are you a news person? Yes. Yes, great show. Yeah, C so, C so the real, the real current news and, the hard news is, is not, there is not really enough of it there. Yeah, I've had, I've had that frustration, too. I end up switching stations from time to time. F Uh, in general. F Uh, I watch a lot of C N N F uh, and C SPAN. F Uh, I, I subscribe to three newspapers. F Uh, D you know, I sort of can't get enough of this. C And, C and I, when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have. Of world, world events and national events. D Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation? Was, was that the, the better paper C or, Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES E rather, w, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe? Oh. Whoever Troy Aikman is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world. Yeah. Yes. A lot of them. I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST. C But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL. F Uh, C and, F uh, each of them covers different things in, in dif, dif, in different ways C and so it's, D you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different perspect, clearly would have a different perspective on the world. That, that is certainly true. F Uh, they will, they will have articles, D like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, D you know theory of relativity. D You know, that started on the front page ran in, into the full, almost full page inside. D Now, these are feature kind of articles. All the, all the, F uh, D you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities. C But, C but there is some very good other articles F uh, you'll find in the, in the JOURNAL. F Uh, I wish it were in more depth. F Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer, just more facts would be nice. F Uh, C N N has, has, D you know, was, was pretty good during the war. F Uh, C and they were, D you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting. C So, C but, D you know, it's not, it's never quite, F Uh, I really am, I enjoy, I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can. Although, D you know, I'm a full time student C and I work full time, too, C so, A E or not full time, C but I work quite a bit C and so <Throat_clearing>, C so I mostly depend on the radio, D you know, on the way to work. I like, I like to listen to national public radio, F uh, all things considered. Yeah, C and I like to listen to that and catch, D you know, I don't get, I don't get a lot of, F uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, D you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not <breathing> <throat_clearing> directly deal with, F uh, D you know, some important issue on the day. C But, Yeah. Right, that's right, yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, you, you li, you like N P R s, F uh, programming? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. H, h, h, F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. <Breathing> D Well <laughter>, we d, we, we have a, a big newspaper situation. F Uh, <throat_clearing> C because, we used to have two newspapers up until, F uh, last Sunday C and a, F uh, major, F uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down. They closed shop, and said, D well, we can't put any more papers out, we're done. Yeah, I thought so. It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned. It, it had, F uh, <throat_clearing> F uh, it got to the news, D you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy. F Uh, which I like. I don't, I don't like to, D you know, I like to save the editorial information or the <throat_clearing>, the politically, F uh, weighted information, D you know, for the, for a different section. I like just to get to the, D you know, find out what's happening pretty quick. C And I feel that the other newspaper, F uh, the T, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here. The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up <breathing> <throat_clearing>. C And, F uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, i, is okay, C but, D you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned. D You know, <breathing> many times it doesn't <throat_clearing>, doesn't reflect my own opinion C and, Uhhuh. No, no, that's the problem. C But, y, D you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery <laughter> on the front page, D you know. Yeah, a, a quarterback for the Broncos E or for the, for the Cowboys. F Uh, you know, you know, you know what I mean that, there is, F uh, <throat_clearing> local news that, F uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other. <Sniffing> C So, F uh, Right, right, yeah <laughter>. Not something you'll, you'll, F uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means. D You know. How, how about you? F Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don't you? Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Right, yeah. F Uh, I, I have a question. F Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, F uh, I, I've kind of gathered lately that, F uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business. Is that, is that a correct assumption? Uhhuh. Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. Wow. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Do you find that you're, F uh, <throat_clearing> F uh, disappointed or pleased with, F uh, F uh, the performance of D like network coverage of news? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, definitely. Uhhuh.
