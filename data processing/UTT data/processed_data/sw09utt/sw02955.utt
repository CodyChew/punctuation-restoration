D Well, I guess it depends on what age. I am in the thirty something, C so I know, E I mean I lived through it. F Uh, are you old enough to know about the war? Uhhuh. Okay. D Well, yeah, you are old enough. C But it was on the fringe. It ended, F uh, when I was in, F uh, college. In, F uh, when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy, I cannot even remember at this point. F Uh, when I turned nineteen it was the year that, F uh, the draft was still going on. If I had been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two. Yeah <laughter>. C So I learned a lesson in gender <laughter>. F Uh, in terms of the war, I do not know. F Uh, D actually I do not really know that much about it. I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media, D you know. F Uh, I guess I think it was, F uh, F uh, not that great that we were in there, F uh, in terms of for how long it lasted. D You know. What do you think? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. The devastation, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And in full faction, yeah. Yeah, it just kind of dragged on. F Uh, I do not know how you were historically. C But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and E I mean, I pa, Yeah. It really, D well, yeah, in fact, because in terms of when your, there is at least ten years between us, C so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, D you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years. F Uh, one of the things I did not like was the weapons, the weapons, E I can't even say it, the weaponry th, systems that they used. F Uh, it just did not seem that, F uh, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either. C And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera, C and you would think, <sigh> D you know, just, F uh, how could the government or the Pentagon, F uh, who, or whomever is in charge there been so careless. F Uh, Conscious, yeah. Nutrisweet, yeah, and all these other things. That is true, F uh, F Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, F uh, Vietnamese people as a whole. F Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves. D You know, C and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there <laughter>. Yeah. I mean I do not think they do. C But I just think it is kind of a shame that, F uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there C and, F uh, C so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good. C And that one I probably, F uh, my main opinion would be w, w, we should not have done it. D Well, that is what I know about the Vietnam War <laughter>. <Laughter> Unless you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, Vietnam? Jeez, yeah. Uhhuh. C And that, that, Uhhuh. In terms of the personal. Yeah. The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a, Uhhuh. The money is after, yeah. E I mean, I think it started actually D like, D like in the late fifties. E I mean D like in fiftyeight, fiftynine. C So it really, E I mean, C because I know, in nineteen sixtythree, E I mean I was nine years old, when Kennedy was shot. C So, E I mean I remember, F uh, right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam. C But then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that. D You know, C and you think to yourself, F oh, my goodness, Eisenhower <laughter>. That sounds ancient, yeah. C And I know, I know, D you know, a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties, F uh, guys that I know, that, they are just kind of bitter, D you know. They, they, D you know, I hate to quo, that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, C but it is that kind of idea. D You know, they just do not feel that socially they were given, D like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome. Yeah. They were not given the, Yeah. D So, D well, I won't keep you any more. That is probably as about as much as we both know <laughter>. C But thanks for talking to me. F Uh, yes, is that where you are at? F Oh, I know where that is. That is beautiful where you are at. D C, yeah. Are you a native of there? Yeah, F uh, Dallas, it is, F uh, ninetytwo degrees here today, C but at least the humidity is, F uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of D like Phoenix. Really? D Well, you, Yeah, D well you are not missing too much then <laughter>. Really. D Well, take it easy. Okay. Byebye. F Uh, just barely. Yeah, I am, F uh, twentynine. C So, F uh, Yeah. C But just, F uh, yeah, exactly. Had some friends that were, that were in it. Really? <Child_talking>. Wowie! Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I think it is, F uh, basically the same way. It is certainly has affected, F uh, U S policy though. There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, F uh, Iraq. C Because, F uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq. I mean it was, F uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one. Yeah. The only difference was that the government said, okay if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent. C And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well. Which, F uh, Right. Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam. It was sort of, of a president's war rather than a country's war. Right. Yeah. It seemed to me like it was, it seemed like it was going on forever, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Yeah, right. Of course now i, w, F uh, now everyone's more, F uh, D you know, environmentally F uh, intelligent than they were back then. E I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now. Uhhuh <child_talking>. Yeah. I do not know if they, F uh, I do not know if they have that resource or not. Yeah. Right. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, D well, you know a little, F uh, a little bit more than I do, explain it. I did not, F uh, get to live through it. That the people that I know that it did, F uh, felt very strongly. Most of, I work for a government contractor. C So most of the guys I work with, are, F uh, F oh, at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans. And, F uh, from Vietnam. C And, I have not talked to any of them that, that were not, D you know, glad that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one. D You know, most of them are ver, very strongly that, that the reason for America to be there was a good one. They just felt that the way America backed them up was not, was not at all right. Yeah. In term of, F uh, Yeah. Personal level and, and the finances, how they started. D You know, D like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy. Because the Congress would not approve, D you know. D So, Yeah. F Huh. I, I, <Cough>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. Right, right, the ticker tape parade and all that. Okay. Yes. F Uh, were you calling from Texas? No, I am in Falls Church, Virginia. Yeah, right in, right near D C. F Uh, pretty much, yep. Been, Yeah. It is about the same weather here. Little bit, little bit cooler, like eightynine. C But, basically the same thing. Yeah. Right. Okay. Byebye.
