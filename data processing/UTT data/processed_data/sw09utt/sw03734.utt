Okay, F uh, clothing at work. F Um, I work as a news reporter, C and a lot of, I work in a, since I work in a small station, this is my first job C and so, I dress very variedly <laughter> if that's a word. F Um, sometimes I'm shooting and doing photography, C and so I'll be in jeans one day, C and another day I'll be on camera, C and so I'll be in a suit C and another day I'll come in C and I won't know what I'm doing, C so I'll wear a pant suit <laughter> in case I have to shoot. C So, it really varies. I try to dress very comfortably. I don't really like dressing up at all. I don't, I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that. I just, I don't know, it just, it takes too much time out of my day, C and I don't, I don't know <laughter>. Yeah, I don't mind it at all. F Um. Uhhuh. Okay. White pants in a bakery. Wow. <Laughter> Okay. What's the name of the bakery? F Oh, Italian I guess. <Laughter>. New clothes and stuff. Yeah, that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, A I really don't like uniforms but, just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear. That just bugs me to death. F Oh, yeah. Sweats and. Yeah, when I was in school, I was a sweat monster. All I had was sweats, C and when it was time to go out, I didn't have anything to wear. Yeah. Yeah. F Um, let me see. I hate shoes. If I didn't have to have <laughter> shoes, I wouldn't have them. I just, F oh, my feet bother me, C and they're just tedious to go find shoes for me, it's just, I don't know. I wear size nine C and it, I don't know if just the shoes I get, I C either don't like them C or they don't fit right, C and I just wish that I could just go without them. F Oh, really. Oh. Just the opposite. C But, F um, let's see, what else do I wear? F Um, if I were in a bigger market, when I do get into a bigger market, I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things, and, F uh, where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things C and I could then I would be able to dress more businesslike and things like that, C but we're all kind of just out of school at this station, C and so we're all, D you know, <laughter> still in sweats, really. C So, it's pretty fun though. Yeah. I. Oh. Yeah. I like this, the, F uh, suits with the, they come D like with a mini type skirt D you know, and the jacket. I like that, C but C but I'm pretty short, I'm five four, C and so that really doesn't flatter me, C but I think it looks good on taller people. Are you? <laughter>. Yeah, any time I go to the store, E I mean, I, I have like two pairs of pants, because I can never find any that are short enough for me C and it's just, F oh, ridiculous. Pants, too, I could do without those. Pants, shoes. <laughter> Yeah, those are nice. Those are nice. Yeah, those are nice. And, tennis shoes. My boyfriend's got me these L A Gear. They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes. C And it, it's just D like a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little whi, white girl tennis shoes. The little ones. Yeah. C And I'm used to those. They're just sort of, D you know, D like your feet E I mean, you don't feel them. You put these things on, it's, it's, D you know, like exercise or something for your feet. <Ugh> C And I have to wear them because he gets upset if I don't. C So <laughter>, C so, C so how do people in Wisconsin dress? <Laughter> Warm. I grew up in New York, C and so I know what warm is. D Like five pairs of socks and, Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh. Oh. F Oh, me neither <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, same here. I don't mind not wearing any makeup <laughter>. F Um, I work at a bakery <laughter> because I'm a, still a, a college student. F Um. C But, we, we have to wear white pants and, F um, any color T shirt, as long as it's not D like a bright color, like a pastel. Yeah. Yeah, the bakers wear all white <laughter>. C And we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back C and so. . Yeah <laughter>, it's Italian bakery. C And, F uh, C so, I don't mind having, having to wear a uniform, because I don't have to buy, D you know A right, as mu, D you know, many clothes. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know <laughter>. I do that every day for school <throat_clearing>. Yeah, C but I, I like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, I know, I don't have very many dress clothes C but I don't mind, I don't need them yet <laughter>. F Um. F Oh, really. Oh. Oh. F Um. F Oh, wow, I love shoes. I always buy shoes <laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Oh. I like the look, the, the D like suit look, professional D like, D you know, look, C but I, <laughter> I really don't have much of an opportunity to wear it <laughter>. F Um I'm going to be a teacher, C so I'll probably just wear casual clothes, maybe skirts and some. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is cute. Yeah. I'm five three C and <laughter>, Yeah. F Oh, really? Oh. I like the D like stretch pants, the cotton ones. They're really comfortable. With a baggy sweatshirt. F Oh, yeah. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, yeah I have a pair of those. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. Warm <laughter> this time this time, of the year pretty warm. Sweaters and. Yeah. Yeah, sleeping in sweats or <laughter> long underwear.
