. Yeah, I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television <laughter>. You were, he was waiting for what again? That's what this was yeah, D well, let me go a head and push one okay? Okay. D Well, basically I like comedy shows <laughter>. F Uh, MURPHY BROWN, F uh, DESIGNING WOMEN. Yeah what do you like? <Laughter>. F Oh, okay. <Laughter>. That's okay we'll been married eleven years C and, F um, we went through that after about five years of marriage, my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out C and we went, we made it almost about eighteen months without a television. Yeah, C but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, F um, gee <laughter>. I needed that, D you know, C and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic, whatever all of those things, F oh, yeah, C and then you never use the V C R, and now we have two of them C and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it <laughter>. Yeah, E I mean it's cause your never home, D you know, you're working, you're at school. D Well, I don't know T V shows, what can I tell you, F um, basically junk that's on television <laughter>. That's my opinion yeah, F um, I like things like I just mentioned, have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that? You don't think so, F oh, that's the one with Candice Bergen in it, F um, Yeah, that would do it. Right, nobody does yeah, then, uhhuh. I know. C And the, F uh, D well I don't, you're probably at least ten years younger then I am C but I could tell you in school that, F uh, the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was, F uh, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN. C And until then I never paid attention to soap operas. C And to this day twenty years later I'm D like, I'm in my thirties, I'm not that old, C but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television <laughter>. Yeah, they, D you know, about the only other kinds of things I like, F um, I like to watch a lot of news, F um, don't you miss that with not having a television so far? How long has it been since you've had one? F Oh my God <laughter>. Yeah, you've got about another six months C and then you'll get one <laughter>. By then, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, my husband is an only child too C and he did miss it that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months, <Laughter> C and I'm trying to think about the only other show I watch. Yeah, I like COSBY, L A LAW is probably, I've seen CHEERS more then that I hate to admit C but, F uh, CHEERS? Yeah, I thought it was good, I've actually been to that bar in Boston it's a nice, D you know, it's a pretty funny show. Yeah. It's just a, D you know, over priced <laughter> downtown, Boston yuppie, D you know, tourist attraction. I'm trying to think what else is on television, I know it's like. Yeah, who didn't? Isn't that sad? Uhhuh. F Oh not, no, I like the pro, D actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to, I watch pro football C but I like the N B A playoffs, back when D like the Pistons were in them C and now, where are you calling from? Sherman, Texas, F oh, I'm in Dallas I was just saying where am I calling you from, D you know, D well then I don't know if you like the, the Mavericks or not, they haven't been that good this year. F Um, we're supposed to talk about television let's see <laughter>, you don't have a T V. Yeah, I'm talking to you from Dallas, uhhuh. My voice you mean? F Oh, no, that's just because I've moved around C and, F uh, I'm originally from Pennsylvania, C so. <Laughter>. F Uh, D actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan. Real big C and, F uh, F um, I always watch them no matter who's on, of course you like them too, right. Do you? F Oh, okay. Yeah, there you go, C and then <laughter>, C and, F um, I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise. I like, I like tennis C so E I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years C but, F um, I just like to watch, D you know, two players really get, go at it, It gets boring after a while C but I don't, go ahead. OPRAH <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, on the, on the tracks yeah, is sh, Maybe cause she got chubby again or something, Was she, was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long? Was her show big when you where in college, since you, haven't been that long? Was it? Yeah I saw reruns of it, I saw tapes of her <laughter>, yeah. Gee, I know isn't that terrible. I know I guess with that money who cares <laughter>. I don't know. Let's see what else is on television. F Oh, if you don't have a V C R A we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it. Yeah, C cause, D you know, if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile C and then, D you know, you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it C and then it usually comes on television within two years. D You know. Yeah, D really, that's television I don't know in general on this project we're suppose to talk <laughter> about C so E I mean, That's okay, don't, E I mean, I, I always. Yeah. F Oh, that's okay. I had one lady one time they called in I just signed up my husband had been on this project, F um, C and I, I, she called in C and it was all about, A we don't have children and it was all about, F um, sending your kids to college, and why you would advise them. C And she was from Boston, C and she, A I shouldn't talk about this but she was, <laughter> pretend she was a television show, C and sh, she was very snooty C and, F uh, her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U C and I said I didn't know what that was I she went, F oh, C and I thought, F um, C so I know, E I mean it's like don't worry about it television at least, D you know, everybody's, at least seen television. During the war did you laugh when they had that man on, F uh, what was his name Wolf Blitzer? That guy that was a reporter for C N N. His name is Wolf Blitzer. Did you see it, him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf? F Uh, no, that was the other guy from C B S, F oh, what was his name, F uh, I can't remember <laughter> his name. Yeah, C but just th, they made jokes about him D like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that, Jay Leno. Uhhuh. Yeah, he's funny. Yeah, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year. E I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months C but, <Breathing> F Uh, yeah, D actually I think it has, E I mean they finally D like C and some of those people they really have funny characters on there. Yeah, they have one character on there they just call it Pat C and they, you don't know if it's a man or a woman <laughter>. C And they say D well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is, C so to see if it's a female they say D well do you carry a purse C and Pat says no I carry a fanny pack <laughter>. C So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man, C or now days, D you know. Yeah it's weird <laughter>. Yeah, it's, yeah it is pretty funny E I mean they do some crazy things. Yeah, WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man <laughter>. C And what's that other one where they, <laughter> where they do the, F um, skits, D well, you've must have seen it recently? You probably have some friends that have television <laughter>? I said you probably have some friends that have television <laughter>. D You know, E I mean you're not totally out of the loop. E I mean, yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, E I mean you really, you can do without one C but after awhile it will start, F um, D you know, E I mean you just kind of all of sudden C cause you're going D well jeez you hear about something that somebody else talked about, C and you just end up doing it C but if you haven't been married that long, D you know, you're doing other things <laughter>. Is that on tape, <laughter> there you go, yeah. F Oh, my what else is on I don't know what did they watch in college when you where in, where did you go to school? F Oh, that's a good school. Yeah, I know about that. They don't have a southern accent up there though. You must be native Texan? D Well your from Indiana, yeah. F Oh, real southern, yeah. Uhhuh.

I mean that's, yeah. Yeah. No we don't C and I wouldn't even E I mean I don't even have cable I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay, somebody, F uh, to, D you know, give me a hundred and fifty, F um <laughter>, channel access to something I'm never going to, E I mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time C and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids I swear to God he works from eight, Where you on the li, phone a long time?
