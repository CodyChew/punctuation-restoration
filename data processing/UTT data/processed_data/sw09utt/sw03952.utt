I'm ready. Do you exercise, F uh, during the day time or go to a gym or anything? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed. F Um, it's really weird, C because I'll get down on the floor, C and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki, I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises, now. C And she can be upstairs in the bedroom, C and I don't know. She knows what I'm talking about. D You know, pretty soon, here she comes. C So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, D you know. F Uh, I had a problem with my back, C so, when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back. C So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then, then my back gives me a problem again. C So I try to do it every night, C and F uh. Yeah, it seems like it's, D you know, I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it D you know, C so you know it's got to be good for you. C But, F um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym C but, F uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago. C So, I was kind of thinking about joining it, C but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet. C But, F uh, it does really make you feel good, C and I like to bicycle, too. C So, that gives you, D you know, lots of exercise. D So. Uhhuh. F Oh, my goodness. Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, F huh? <Laughter>. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, D well, like I say, I just do it at night, D you know, C and, F um. Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up. D You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape, C and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape D you know. C So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night D you know, like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow D you know <laughter>. C So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me. D You know, D so. D Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising. I wish I knew how to swim, C but I don't, C so I don't go swimming. Uhhuh, C but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you D you know, for every part of your body. C So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that. If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, D you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there, C but they don't have a pool in this small city, either. D So. D Well, listen then, it's been nice talking to you. Okay then. Byebye. All right. Oh. Yeah, I, I used to go to a gym, F um, last summer, C but then I started school again, C so, it's, F um, C so I don't exercise as much as I'd like. C But, I, I do enjoy, F um, going to a gym and working out, C or just D like, I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up, C and I ride a exercise bike a lot. C So. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. . Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Right. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, it does. Yeah. I enjoy that a lot. I, F um, bike in the summer. I belong to a biking club here in Kenosha. C And, F um, we go on a, D like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday. C So <laughter>, I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, D you know, can be in shape. No, huhuh. No, I go with my dad. He exercises a lot more than I do, though. F Oh, yeah, he's always exercising. C But, I'm not that energetic <laughter>. I get lazy sometimes. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, that's what I like to do. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Wow <laughter>. F Oh, yeah, that is neat <laughter>. Yeah, F um, I don't swim much, neither. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh. F Um. Yeah, nice talking to you. Okay. F Um, bye.
