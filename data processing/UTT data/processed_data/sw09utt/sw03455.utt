Okay, F uh, I guess our topic is about movies C and, F uh, what is coincidence, we got a babysitter C and we went to the movies that past weekend. <Laughter> C And we saw CAPE FEAR. It is. It's really good. F Oh, how was that? I heard that's, a movie that, F uh, you really can't take children. Is that true? <Noise>. Oh. Oh. Yeah, yeah, because, F uh, the little boy dies. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Uhhuh. <Static> F Oh, I want to see that one. D Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful. It was really suspenseful. C So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see. F Uh, no, C and it, F uh, it was kind of, I don't know, it's kind of both, I guess, C but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. C But, F uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think. C And it, it was a real good movie. C And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST <laughter>. Because we have two kids. And FIEVEL GOES WEST <laughter>. <Laughter> C But, F uh, those were, those were okay, C so, C And then, F oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies, C but I, we've rented some videos. C And I think the last one I rented was, F uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore. C And, F uh, that, that, that's okay. That's pretty good. F Oh, and, F uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB? Yeah. Yeah, we rented that one. C And, F uh, F uh, I guess that's about it. Have you rented any movies lately? F Oh, yeah, that was good. We rented that one, too. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D So, do you go to the movies often, C or, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, D well, we have two little kids, C so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies. We have to <breathing> dig up a babysitter C and <laughter>, C And that's only the only time we can go out, C so <child_yelling>, our time is scarce. <Laughter>. C But, F uh, <child_yelling> we, we, we t, we, D you know, we're, we're big movie people C and we try and do C and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. F Uh, F Oh, yeah, F uh, Bertinelli, or what's her name. I can't, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <laughter>. Yeah, that was real good, I saw that one, F uh, two part series, C and I heard it was a true story. Yeah, I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too. C And, C and then I saw that other movie about, F uh, MOTHER, DAUGHT, MOTHER, WIFE, MURDERER. Did you see that one? Yeah. Did you see that one, that was, was really good. That was supposed to be a true story, too. Yeah. Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that. Boy we have <laughter>, we, we see all the same movies. Yeah. Uhhuh. I know. Yeah, yeah. F Huh. D Well <laughter>, We sure do have a lot in common. If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie <laughter>. C But, C and we don't really, d, do you all have, do you all still have driveins up there C or, F Um, D well, we may have just a couple over here. Uhhuh. F Oh, so did I <laughter>. F Oh, I heard that was excellent. Is it? F Uh, I wanted to see that <noise>. I was deciding between that and, F uh, MY GIRL C and, F uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL. F Oh, it was excellent. It was a really, really good movie. I'd recommend it. F Uh, I heard the opposite that, F uh, you should take children to see it. <Noise> F Uh, there were quite a few, F uh, kids in there with their parents. Yeah. F Uh, I don't know, though, I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me C so, Right, yeah. It was sad. It was really sad. C But, F uh, his, it kind of shows how his, F uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death. Maybe. C But, it was really good. It was sad, very sad. <Laughter>. Yeah. I heard it was, F uh, sort of D like, F uh, not, F uh, too violent, C but it was kind of D like, F uh, gross, kind of like, F uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, D like. F Oh, really? Oh. F Oh, yeah. F Uh. F Oh, I've seen, F uh, <lipsmack> previews for them <laughter> on T V, C but <laughter> I, Yeah. F Oh, yeah, I like to rent movies, too. Oh. F Oh, I, I didn't see that. Yeah. I have seen that at the theatres, yeah. That, that was cute. F Uh, <lipsmack> the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox C and, F uh, Yeah, I liked that. I like Michael J. Fox a lot. <Laughter>. He's one of my favorites. I like his movies. No, not too often. I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend. C But, F uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see. I just, D you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them. F Oh <laughter> I see. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. F Oh, I watched that movie with, F uh, <lipsmack> Barbara, F uh, F uh, what was her name. F Oh, Bar, that, F uh, her sister got killed C and, F uh, <lipsmack> she had a baby. The husband was a dentist C and he had murdered her. That was, that was pretty good. Yeah, uhhuh, F oh, Valerie Bertinelli. That's it, yeah. Yeah, uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, F uh, with, F uh, Judith Light? F Uh, Yeah, I did see that. Yeah, I did. That was on a while ago, wasn't it? Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that was pretty good. I, <Laughter>. Yeah. I like, F uh, the true stories. They're more interesting. C And it's hard to believe that, D you know, this really happened. Some of them are pretty bad. C But, <Laughter>. Yeah. Okay <laughter>. Yeah, uhhuh. Yeah, do you have them there?
