Are you ready? She didn't announce that to you? F Oh, I see. That's fine. F Um, I think, F uh, that's pleasurable for all of us, <laughter> if we choose the right restaurant <laughter>. D So, what are your thoughts on dining out? Not for the price? Okay. Uhhuh. The be, Really? Okay. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. My word, it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh? Oh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Okay. Wow. C And where was that at, near your, Where, is it in Dallas? Is it in the phone book? Do you know how to spell it? Okay. Kalli, K A L L I? Okay. Uhhuh, section, yes, uhhuh. What about fast foods? Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food? You do, like Arby's? See I don't like Arby's. No, because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever. They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver C and they, they form it, C and they make it look like roast beef, C and I said, no, thank you. D Well, that's not what I heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about. Uhhuh. Really? Unless somebody is trying to blackball them. Uhhuh. Okay. How about the health food, F uh, restaurants? D Well, like this one C but it's probably not advertised as such, is it? C Or, Uhhuh. Health food, F uh, restaurants that, D Well D well, like, F um, <lipsmack> D well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between. C But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. D You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, D you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product C and they list them. Now there's one restaurant that does that C and it's called Rodolfo's over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe. C And they r, have very good food over there. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Lipsmack> They do list, F um, D you know, list the fat, Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, it was pretty reasonable. I, it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay, wha, which is kind of high for lunch I guess. Yes. Yes, uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, C but, F um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, F uh, F um, men waiters. D Well, if you're looking for a nice, Uhhuh. D Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody w, like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing. Yeah. Uhhuh. C And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime. Because they're, D Well, they have lunch specials that you can't, you can't beat that price, F uh, if you went to a cafeteria. D Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast C and it was excellent. It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast C and it was exce, F Oh, it was, D Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north C and that was a no no. C And I haven't gotten over that from the north. I know they say that, that is, C but I'm, <Lipsmack> C but they've got all these caution signs now on fish C and so I kind of stay a, Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. E I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish. I, C and especially, F uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish. I, <Laughter> D Well, yeah. C So yo, I am, <lipsmack> C and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, F uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote, F uh, unnatural growth in their products. C So E I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy. C So I'm, I, D you know, I, Uhhuh. Yeah. Corrode. F Huh. Uhhuh. D Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good. F Oh, dear. Wow. Sure. Yeah. That's right. Everything we eat. Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, D you know, <Laughter> D Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs, Uhhuh. F Oh, I didn't, I didn't quite hear all of it. Right <laughter>. D Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else. D Well, a little bit for the price, C but, F uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the m, some of the most expensive places I've been had the w, the, really the, the worst quality of food. Really. F Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much. Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside E or inside of a place that we drove up C and I was like, I'm not eating in there <laughter>. Are you nuts? C And, F uh, we went in C and it was the m, it was the most wonderful food. Yeah. I'm serious. F Um, a lot of, F uh, one place that we went just recently F uh, was to Atchafalaya. No, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right. <<Asks someone in the background>> What's the name of that restaurant? <<Person in the background replies>> Where at?. <<Asks someone in the background again>> The Hari Krishna. <<Person in the background relies again>> Oh. Kalachandji's. Kalachandji's. It's all vegetarian, C and it, it was just fabulous. E I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it. F Um, Kalachandji's. It's, F uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant. Yes. F Uh, I think so. It should be. F Uh, it starts with a K. D So <laughter>. K A L A, I think, C H A N D. That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. I think it's, F uh, probably listed in the restaurants, D you know. C But it's, F uh, it's just fabulous food. <Breathing>. D Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes. F Oh, really? Why? F Oh, no, no, no. Someone has been lying to you. What they use is roast beef. That's what, F Oh, my goodness. I'm surprised. My dad worked for Arby's for several years. Yeah. D Well, that's happened before. C But we like good s, F uh, w, we're, we like Mexican food. And stuff like that. C And so, F um, <Breathing> A health food? Like, like, name one <laughter>. I'm not sure what you're talking about. F Huh. I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that C so, I really don't have anything to compare it to. It would be good I think, F uh, I don't know how expensive they are. It sounds like that it would probably, For one person? Oh <laughter>. A bit <laughter>. <Sniffing>. Yeah, I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, D you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without <laughter>. Yeah. Maybe, maybe that. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that, then maybe. Yeah, I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, D you know, the broiled, Yeah. Probably that's true. C But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried, D Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant <laughter> to eat chicken? That's one of my husband's pet peeves. He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, D you know. F Oh, really? F Oh, catfish is wonderful. F Oh, really. Really. Why? Oh. F Huh. That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. That's true. F Oh, on one hand I see that C and on the other hand, F uh, my older sister remembers when, F uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i, I guess, had a halflife of, F oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land. C So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically. C And then they take these things that will rust C and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more. Oh. C And then they wouldn't think. They were floating around C so they shot holes in them to sink them. C And this is before I was born. C So, E I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened, C and, C and who's, D you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent. You can't get away from it C so I think, To some point, yeah, D you know. C So there's, D you know, there's some things I think we can av, we, D you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, D you know, this is not in my control. C So I'm C either going to be, I'm C either going to starve to death C or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, D you know.
