Okay. Uhhuh. I am, too. Yes. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's good. C And how old is your baby? Yes. D Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night. My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago C and he lost sixtytwo pounds C and I lost twentyone. <Lipsmack>. C So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program C and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school. We have a little path that we do. C And, F uh, except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been we try to get out, F uh, every, every night. C And he plays racquetball twice a week, C but I'm not into that, C so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned. Yes. Right <laughter>, that's right. I know my kids are into sports C and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty C so we will just go out after that. C So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk. Yes. Yes. No my husband never was either until he lost the weight. That was his decision. He had arthritis in his hips C and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise. C So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night. C And our dog has lost a little weight. He walks every night, too <laughter>. C So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes. Yes. Making time for it. Yes. I know, I do, too. Right. No. I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me. D You know, it's nice to have another person there, C but... Mostly, it's my husband C and sometimes it's my kids. Uhhuh. Me, too. I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan C and it just wore me out. I would leave totally exhausted. I never lost any weight, C and I got to the point I dreaded going in. So walking seems to be a good solution for me C and it doesn't cost anything <laughter>. Yes. That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and... Yep. Yep. Yep, that's all I do, too. Okay. All right, D well, I'm not a big exerciser, C but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight. C And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker. Are you? I don't do that, F oh, A I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, D you know, and keep their arms up. I don't do that. I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby C or, D you know, C and I have to do that at least once a day. If it, If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before. I can't neglect that because of the baby either. She just, F uh, D well, she was premature, C so she's about nine months now, though. Goll, times goes fast. <Laughter>. F Oh, that's great. Uhhuh. <Breathing>. F Oh, my goodness. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Exactly. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. D Well, I think that is just wonderful. D Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children C and so, F uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task. D You know. F Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, F oh, this is wonderful, let's go <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Now, does your husband usually go with you, then? F Oh, D see, D now that's really nice. Because mine's at meetings sometimes C and, C and he's not really into it C so I have to, Uhhuh. I think that is so wonderful. <Laughter>. I bet. I think that's really, really good. C And, C and, D you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine. It's not, D like when I first started, it, D you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there. C But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a <laughter>... D You know. C And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me C and sometimes they don't. C And when they don't, I, I really notice, D you know, how fun it can be when they come. C So, F uh, I like to have somebody come with me. F Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area. C So it, it's not real dangerous, C but still, I don't like to go alone. D So <<faint>>. Yeah. Yeah. D You know, D Well, I think that's great. I, C and, D well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do. I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing. F Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me. Uhhuh <<very faint>>. Yeah, yeah. Right <laughter>, right. C And it gives me time to think. C So I think, not only does it help my body, C but I think it helps my mind too. C So I like that. Uhhuh. Yeah, need something C and, They can wait until you get back home. D Well, I think that's great <lipsmack>. D Well, that's what I do for <laughter>, Okay.
