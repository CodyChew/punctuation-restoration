Okay <cough> <child_yelling>. First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing. F Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly. I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution. It doesn't seem like, C but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home D you know, C and it's kind of dangerous. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. C But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier? F Oh. That's an interesting thought. Uhhuh. Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat, C and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, D like a smog problem or something like that. F Um. Uhhuh. I gue, I gue, yeah, I guess I've never really, F uh, thought about the fact, D like in California they, they have a lot of smog problems. C And it's real hilly there. C So that is probably something that plays a <child_talking> big factor. <throat_clearing> I think probably just, F uh, a lot of factories, F um, D you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that. Uhhuh. Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, F uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something? F Um. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, the diesel. F Oh, yeah. I know a lot of people with diesels <laughter> truck, D you know. C But, F um. No, I don't. I, I work in Waco at a T V station. My mother works at T I. That's why, Yeah, yeah. You work at T I? F Oh, okay. Okay. F Oh, okay. That's interesting. <Laughter> What else causes air pollution? F Um, Noise. Noise causes air pollution <cough>. Yeah, that's why I thought of it. Oh. Yeah. Landfills. We just. Yeah. We just had a big, F uh, thing here in Waco. They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill. C And, F uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow. C And so they, Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. One one of the big concerns is they have a, there's a school right across the highway from the landfill. Yeah. C So the parents were really, really upset. Yeah. They, they've been fighting over it for the last year, C and they just now approved it. C So they're going to try an appeal or something. Yes. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, it, it. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. F Uh, I don't know. We live, F um, D well, I'm close to Salt Lake C and there's mountains, F uh, D you know, all around. C But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, D you know. D Really, it's, it's fairly clean, F um, I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some, C but, you know how quite a, Yeah I think sometimes it seems to be C but, C But, F uh, D anyway, I don't know. I know there's a lot of plants here, when I drive down D you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things C and, F Oh, uhhuh. Yeah. We, we have a real fog problem. F Um. The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, F um, it's kind of like it, it just stays for a month quite foggy. C But, F uh, gee, I don't, I don't know what else. I know cars <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's, that's what I see burning a lot. I'm not exactly sure what they're burning. I know, F uhhuh, there are some oil companies, C and I'm sure that that contributes a lot <laughter> just the burning of the che, F Oh, I don't know. I haven't, I haven't heard that. I know, F uh, I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything, C but I know I think they, they differ from state to state. C But, F um, D you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years, C and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others. I think those, F uh, what are they, the, I know, a Rabbit's one, diesel the diesel cars. Yeah, they seem to put out quite a bit <laughter>. F Huh. Oh. D Well, do you, F um, are you working for T I? F Oh, okay. Oh. F Oh, uhhuh. C And that's how you got involved. Yeah. No we, we have, F um, my husband's sister lives in Dallas D actually. C And they kind of got it, us involved that way. Yeah C but. D Well, I don't, I don't know. Yeah, noise. I've got, speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little. Yeah, he is quite noisy. Yes, gee, I don't know. I know that, F um, don't dumps, <laughter> D you know, where you dump all your trash in the, F uh. Yeah, I'm sure that does. I know they're always churning that up C and I, I think they burn a lot there, too. Oh. D Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that. D You know, we, F um when we've taken things to the dump, just the dump, F uh, that is, F uh, D you know, closest to us, there's some houses around there, C and I know that on windy days, D you know they're always moving the, the trash over to different spots, C and they've got those big bulldozers, C and you can see the dust flying, C and, C and I'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty C and, F Oh, is there. Worried about their their kids getting, F huh.
