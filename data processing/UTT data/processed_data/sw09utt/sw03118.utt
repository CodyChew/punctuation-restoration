Okay, do you want to start? Uhhuh. D Now that, do you, do you agree, that they should all be unanimous? C Or even, even in, F uh, like they said, D you know, lesser, D you know, trials, D you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous. E I mean if one is determined that it's, D you know, that he feels that he's, D you know, going against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees. C So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets <noise> tired of fighting, D you know, just gives in. C And they have to stay in until they all agree yeah. I don't know, I'm not sure if they go, E I mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly, C but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either, D you know, either he or she can either go free or to jail, either one. Uhhuh. That's, that's just it. I don't understand. You're supposed to, D you know, go in if you have, D you know, D like if you've never heard of the people before or anything, C but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total, totally impartial to it. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, I agree. I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone. Not only, D you know, that they have to stay in there, C but, hey, how many times have you heard of judges being bought over. D You know, C so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has the presiding, D you know, F uh, vote. I think he can be, D you know, I, I don't know if it's the way it is in real life, C but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way C and the judge to, totally finds it obnoxious C and he completely, D you know, goes the other way. D Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, F oh, my God. If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long they'd be sitting <laughter>. I, I think it's just, I don't, E I mean, I think it's as fair as it can possibly get, C but I just think it's really har, D you know, E I mean, some cases go on for years, D you know. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I don't know how it could be more fair. Course, I don't know. Maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on, on trial before. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. I know. I don't know that much about it either. I just, I don't know. I, I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, D you know, how they can make it more fair for them or not, C but then again, maybe they should be there C so that is fair. I don't, I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I think we can hang up anytime <laughter>. No, I don't what else to say, C so. It was nice talking to you, too. Bye. Okay, F uh, I haven't, I don't know that much about the possi, what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury, C but, F uh, I think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide. I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be new, unanimous. <Lipsmack> <breathing>. I don't, I don't know, I don't know if I feel, I don't feel real strongly about that. If the, F uh, the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, F uh, I didn't think that you really had to have a, a jury <laughter>. Unless, I guess, if you request one you can. C But I think, yeah, making it unanimous sometimes might, F uh, let, A the only thing, it might let more people get off. I don't think it would convict any more people. C And we have so many people already, D you know, the jails are already overloaded. Yeah. D Well, if it's, no, C but they, they, what if they never agree. Doesn't it just, F uh, do they have to go back and do a whole new trial C or, Agree <<faint>>. Yeah, C and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent <laughter>. Especially because there's twelve. The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too, a lot of times, F uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury C and they can sway them that way, too. I know. I don't think, D well, I guess you really can't, C but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either. C So, F uh, C but then, D again, D you know, they, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge C and that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, D you know, they have to, they stay till they retire C and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too <laughter>. I know. Yeah. I think in some cases they are. C But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's, D you know, C so that's another thing where they have the power, C but maybe juries could be less than twelve people C or would that be more fair or less fair. Maybe there should be more than twelve people <laughter>. I don't, <Laughter> I know. I don't know. That's true, C and I've never been on jury duty, C but they have to keep going and going and going. And lose their, A not lose their jobs, but not go to work. It could be, Really, I've never seen one in real life either C so I don't have, D you know, I don't know that much about it, C but I think, it seems that we have a, a pretty fair system compared to other countries. I don't know how we could make it more fair. I really don't. The unanimous vote is questionable, though. C And, C and how, how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed, too. C Because, F uh, <breathing> I don't know if you should really have a jury for s, a small infraction. C But I'm not sure who gets them <laughter>. I don't know anything <laughter>. Right. No, whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, F uh, unique I think, when they started it. C So, how long do we need to talk? <Laughter>. Do you know? Okay. F Uh, in, F uh, what do I do now? Do you know? Anything, C or just wait for someone else. Okay, D well it was nice talking with you. Thanks. Byebye.
