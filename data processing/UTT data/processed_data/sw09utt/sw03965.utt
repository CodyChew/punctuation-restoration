Okay. Do you, F uh, do any woodworking? F Oh, F um, what do you do, for a hobby or for, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out. My husband cuts them out C but, F uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is, is a lot slower C and then, F uh, he's got a router, C but now he wants a plunge router. <Laughter>. C But D anyhow, he cuts them out, C and then I, I took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right, D you know. C And what we want to do is, D you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and s, and see if we can sell some of them. C But, F uh, I really like it so far. C And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood C so I took a pattern off of that, C and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face C and then you, you make the dress for it, C and you drill holes around the top of the head C and you, you stick in F uh, D like rope and tie ribbons around it. It looked really cute, D you know. C So I've got a couple of those started. Yeah, C and then F uh, C but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. What do you do? I wonder how you, you just, they buy them from you, C or you just given them to them on consignment or something? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um, I see. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, these little things are so cute, though, D you know. I. I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, D you know C and, F uh, there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out. In fact, I just sent to Shop Smith back in Ohio for a rocking horse pattern. <Laughter> Yeah, we, D well, Gene's got one of those too <laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah, D so D anyhow. Yeah, D well, F uh, he's retired now C and, F uh, I'm kind of semi retired. My company went bankruptcy, C so I'm drawing my pension from them, C but I'm still looking for a part time job, D you know. C But, F uh, he has all day long that he can, D you know, work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that, D you know. C And he's got a lot, a lot of tools, C so. It's just, it's just getting started, D you know. C But, F um, these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good. F Um, I know a lot of people that have gotten them, D you know. My next door neighbor, every time she sees something, she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it, D you know <laughter>. C So, I'm just hoping that, D you know, that we can get some cut out and painted, D you know, before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time, D you know. C But, F uh. It seems, it seems like they go real good, D you know. E I mean, the country, anyhow, out here C and I live out in the valley C and country seems to be the in thing out here D you know, everybody wants little country pieces. C So anything that looks like it might be country is what they want, D you know. Yeah. C And, F uh, this little rabbit that I made in, F uh, tole painting class, D you know, is D like a welcome. It's got a, it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it, in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts. C And, Okay. I do, C and I really love it. F Um. Uhhuh, I do it for a hobby C and I have my own equipment, C and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, F uh, in the process of getting a router C and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out. What kind of things do you like to do with wood? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. F Oh, that is fun. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh, the twine. Yeah, those are so cute. They are really cute. F Oh, that is, that sounds really fun. D well, they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah C and I just got back from that today, C so if you could get your projects into boutiques, F oh, they are wonderful. You could make a lot of money from those. F Uh, apparently, D like that boutique, F um, they take, A F oh what was it, twenty percent of the sell price. You would put your sell price F uh, C and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter. C And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned <laughter>. C So, you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it. C So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit. They are. I, I have seen those. Those are darling. Uhhuh. <Gasp> Oh. F Oh, that's what I want, is a Shop Smith <laughter>. That's my ul. F Oh, does he? F Oh, that's my ultimate dream <laughter>. F Oh, you're lucky. Uhhuh. . Uhhuh. Oh. How fun. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, how nice. <laughter> I'm jealous. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <laughter> Oh. Uhhuh. No. Uhhuh. D Well, how is the market for things like that in California? . Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. They just snap it right up, F huh. Oh. Uhhuh. Oh.
