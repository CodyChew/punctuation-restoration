Okay, I, I do a fair amount of cooking. C And, C and I love having guests to dinner. I probably do that about once a month. C And, F uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, D you know, it, it, I like to prepare chicken, A that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole. How about you? F Um. F Uh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish. F Uh, I made scallops the other night, that was unusual, C and, F uh, basically, F uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave C and you sprinkled, F uh, you swished around a little melted butter and do, F uh, F oh I do not know, micro, microwaved them for about nine minutes. No, no, four and a half to five minutes C and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top, very simple, but very nice. C So, if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good. Sesame seeds and bread crumbs. C And, F uh, my husband liked it. C And, F uh, no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, F uh, fish items. C But, D you know, I, I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store <swallowing>. F Uh, one of the things I love to do, eat out. How about you? Do you have any particular places you like going? Uhhuh. Yes. I have been there. C And, F uh, it's kind of, kind of like Black Eye Pea, C but I do not think it's a chain. Oh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, I, I do not feel like they are very healthy, C and I always, feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals. D You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, <laughter> go to them. F Oh, how was it? F Um. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I tend to, F uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, F uh, I like experimenting on, on food C and sometimes I go for ex, fairly exotic things. C And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true, C but <laughter> C and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail. F Uh, the last time we had some, F uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonder, wonderful in the recipe C and it was just a total bust. I was, sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on. F Oh my that's ambitious. F Um. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Huh, see I am not, that's interesting. One of the things I do not make is dessert. C And, F uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, F uh, D you know, we have ice cream, <laughter> or something like that. C And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco. F Uh, everything else was fine, C but that was a fiasco. F Uh, yeah. Yeah. C And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth, C so I can live without, live without dessert for the most part. Yeah. F Uh, do you cook for yourself C or do you cook for others? Yeah. D Well, when I was single, I used to, F uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato. C And, F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. C And, E I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it, if I had, C or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up. C And, F uh, it's amazingly satisfying. Yeah. I did, I did not say it was nourishing, C but it was satisfying. C And, Yeah, yeah tha, C but, D you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself, C so I ate very simply. C And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things. E I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that. C Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab. C And, F uh, Yes, <laughter> and have an explosion. <Laughter> Sometimes it blows up anyway. I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents. C And, F uh, I had this wonderful recipe C and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, F uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours, C and it does turn to toffee inside the can. C And, F uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place. It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me. C And, C and the boy friend thought, it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock, C so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang C and there he was. C And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for <laughter>, for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up. F Uh, I really do not remember, that was about ten years ago, I just remember how embarrassing it was. C And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before C and I never had that problem, just that one time. C And, F uh, he, he was a gourmet cook, he was kind of pushy too. Acted like, he came from San Francisco C and he had a very sophisticated taste. I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him C and, C and <laughter>, D well, it was a memorable evening anyway. F Uh, as far as, I, I do enjoy cooking C so, I was awfully glad I was given this, Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, those are things I like the most. I like fish and chicken the most. C And, F uh, <throat_clearing> most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can. Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it. C And then I just, F uh, D you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it. Uhhuh. Sesame seeds and bread crumbs. <Throat_clearing> Uhhuh. Yeah. Right, uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, uhhuh. F Oh, there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central. I like that, it's just, it's just home cooking. Uhhuh. Right, exactly, uhhuh, C and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea. C So, I do not really like, F uh, <throat_clearing> D you know, F uh, F uh, chili places or, A what is it, Judge Roy Bean's, C or I do not like greasy places. Yeah. Right, C and I, C and I got, F uh, chicken marinara the last two times. It was, F uh, it was great. C Because that's, that's what I like, I do not like it, D you know. I just like a baked, D you know, a piece of chicken C and then I get D like green beans and mashed potatoes. D You know. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. My, F uh, my brother tried to make, F uh, a bunch of things, F uh, way back. He tried to make bagels one time. Yeah, C and, F uh, <throat_clearing> we took some C and then we had, F uh, German Shepherds at the time, C and we took some and gave it to the dogs, C and the dog never, D you know, he treated it like a milk bone C and he never did finish it. He just barely made a dent in it. F Uh, C and, F uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time. It's, F uh, supposed to be candy. C And, F uh, it, it did not turn out very well, it was, D you know. It D like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, F uh, into a kind of a candy stick, C so, F uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. D Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you. C Or, Yeah, just about. Uhhuh. Use about half the sugar, C or make everything diet. Mostly, I just cook for myself. Uhhuh. It's easy, that's for sure. Yeah. Yeah, I always put cheese on them. Uhhuh. Yeah, C but, D you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein, it's mostly starch. C So, it fills you up C and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get. F Oh, yeah, it really is. Then you have to make a salad C or, Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Except you get to taste the product instead. <Laughter> Fill them up C or blow up. Yeah. . F Oh, yeah <sniffing>. <Noise>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Right. Uhhuh. Did you let the can cool off? Yeah. F Huh. Yeah. Right.
