Ok, I was watching the soap opera awards. C And, F uh, it is really making me want to exercise C because every single woman in the audience is, F uh, about ten pounds. D So. F Uh, I started anchoring last, F uh, anchoring, F uh, exercising last, about last Spring, when I, F uh, joined the President's Health Club. C And, I was really motivated and going, C and, F uh, I went, F uh, for a little while, F uh. I went pretty regular, C but it is hard to go regularly for a long time. C And where I live in Waco, F uh, they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's C so now I do not have a club C and I am, F uh, I do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that, C so I am not exercising at the time, at the moment. C So, I wish I could. I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do that, C but I just do not like just running with no where to go <laughter>. I just cannot do that. C So, Uhhuh. F Uh. Yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, F uh, work out with, or walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation. C And you can also, E I mean you can, D you know, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, F uh, sort of contest. D You know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that. C And that would keep you going. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. That is very true. It seems like you walk quicker. You just, perky is a good word for it when you exercise. C And I understand that walking is suppose to be the, D like, the best exercise. Better than running. Things like that C cause it, it works everything C and it gets your breathing up C and it doesn't yeah, it doesn't hurt you. D Like, I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that. D So. Wow. Wow. Yeah. F Uh, oh <laughter>. I guess my, my, favorite exercise, in the, F uh, in the gym, is the bikes. To go, yeah, there are these stationery bikes that you just ride C and if you watch television, A they usually have television in there or something, or if you listen to a walkman, it is pretty, it is pretty okay. D Again, that is sort of weird, because you, you, are not going anywhere C and, F uh, I use to play racquetball C and I really liked that, because, D you know, to me it had a point. D You know, F uh, there were points you could, you would make C and there was a point to it, C but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just, I don't like that, <laughter> I just can't understand that. So, I don't do, F Uh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. I know a lot of people just to be safe, D like you were talking about, walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning. F Uh, you see a lot of, F uh, mostly older people though C but, that, F uh, walk in the malls. D You know, D like early in the mornings and things like that. I have never tried that. I don't know. D You know, I have never even thought about it really. F Uh. Oh. Uhhuh. C And that is a little less, Ok. Oh <laughter>. Oh <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> D Well, I understand that. I have been trying to get myself motivated. I had gone, gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor. F Uh, she had injured her back and needed a walking partner C and I thought that would be the time to get going. C And so, we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks C and, F uh, then she had to get back to work and which was <inhaling> traveling to New York C and so she is not around. C And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning I don't seem to find time in the day time. C And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, more than weight, of course, I could lose, F uh, lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds C but I think more than that, I also notice I just feel better when I exercise. C And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape. C But, F uh, all the same it is connected to my attitude, C because I am not feeling as perky and good. I am also, it is hard to get my attitude to, F uh, to get myself up there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C And you have less chance of hurting yourself. Yeah. Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in P E C and it felt good, C but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee. D Actually, I hyper extended it or something, C and, F uh boy, I was suffering for about three weeks later. C So, C and I have never had that problem before C but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me <laughter>. <Laughter> It is showing up in the weirdest places. F Oh, is it? Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah. D Well, I have got a dog now C and, of course, she needs walking C and that is a little less trau, F uh, burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her. C And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to C and, Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is kind of an idea. We, we have, F uh, over here in Plano, a little recreation center that has got, F uh, a walking track, that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year. C But, I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly, C and it there is just nothing else to look at C and I actually get more tired doing that, than I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good. There I could barely make a couple of miles <laughter>.
