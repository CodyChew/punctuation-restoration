D Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, F um, the care of the elderly. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. <Noise>. D Well, that's nice. No. <Throat_clearing> It's really sad <breathing>. It's really a sad situation. C And, F uh, I think a lot of people struggle with. I, I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, D you know, the parent is, doesn't always want the inlaw living in the house. Is that right? D Well, that's really sad. Uhhuh. <<faint>> Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Yes. D Well, I know when the, I remember being a child C and my grandmother had had <noise> se, several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents tried to keep her in the house, C and they did for a long time. A I couldn't, tell you how long, until she got, F uh, where she had to have complete care, C and so, they couldn't, D you know, keep her in the house anymore, C and it was really hard on everyone. She had to have, D you know, twentyfour hour a day care. C And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house. C And that, F um, they put her there, C and <lipsmack> we all went just constantly until she died. C But it was very hard on everyone to see, D you know, grandmother be like that, C and I don't know that, D you know, <laughter> I don't, being so young, I don't remember why. D You know, what was, why she had to go there. Uhhuh. D Well, I do remember that she was, D you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way. C And that that, they couldn't, they found that they could not D you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed. No, C but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, D you know, in the nursing home. I do remember the other patients there, F uh, <noise> being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone. Uhhuh. Right, right. C And I guess that's hard on people to give, <breathing> give up their lives. If they're busy they don't <breathing> D you know. It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, I guess. If you can afford them. C But, D anyway. D Well, I'm, glad it worked out good for your family. <Talking>. Yes, I have. In fact, F uh, <breathing> just a little over, just a little less than a year ago, F uh, my mother <talking> went to be with the Lord, C and we cared for her the last, F oh, seventeen months of her life here in the, at home. Aside from, F uh, <lipsmack> having to, F uh, take her to the hospital C and, F uh, D you know, those times, D well, she was there in the, the regular hospital. C And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer, C and so the doctor elected to have her, F uh, finish out, F uh, in the hospice program. C And, F uh, I, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing home, because, F uh, she's around her own fa, D you know, the, the elderly parent in question is around their own family. The, F uh, hospice program provides a hospital type bed. A D Well, it is a hospital bed, and all the oxygen, stuff and a, F uh, and a visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. C And it's all taken care of by, by, F uh, Medicare, F uh, <lipsmack> C and, F uh, it, it's, it's really neat, F uh. C And I, D you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't banish, F uh, my old loved one to a, to a warehouse. C And that's, that's what I basically, F uh, view a nursing home as, a warehouse, C so <laughter> that's, Pardon me? Uhhuh. . Oh. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, I know. C But, F uh, in this case, F uh, spouse and I, F uh, are, F uh, we're, are, are, F uh, united in this area because, I guess her father, her grandfather and grandmother both lived with, F uh, <lipsmack> her parents, F uh, th, th, their golden years too, C so this isn't D like, F uh, F uh, just one, one, F uh, instance. In fact, F uh, her, F uh, F uh, experiences were, were invaluable to me. F Uh, <laughter> in fact, I don't know if I could have, F uh, held up, F uh, D you know, without my wife, F uh, helping in this, this, in this case. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. D Well, maybe, D well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it. F Oh, boy, yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, then, then there's almost, then there's almost no, no, F uh, F uh, choice left to her then <noise>. Uhhuh. Right. In fact, just, F uh, just, F uh, sit and chat with them for five minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is. Uhhuh <noise>. Right. C And then, then, F Oh, yeah, it did, C and I was just pr, I just praised the Lord that, that we were able to, F uh, <lipsmack> have, F uh, F uh,
