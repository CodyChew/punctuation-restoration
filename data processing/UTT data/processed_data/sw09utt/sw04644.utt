<Clicking> D Well, F uh, preferred benefits, F uh, I worked for a large corporation in the past C and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there C and, F uh, there is a lot of profit that's coming in C but when it comes to, F uh, small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick, quickly, or whatever, or however you want to say it C and, F uh, the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay we've got this amount of money, let's put into this plan, this plan, you got Four Oh One K plans. You have, F uh, better vacation plans, F uh, you have, just in general, maternity leave plans tha, that kind of thing. Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations, F uh, D you know, they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it. C So, I've worked for both big and small C so I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, F uh, the pros and cons of both. Sure. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. F Huh. <Noise> Sure. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. That's pretty good for, D you know, being a, a school district type program. Uhhuh. Wow. That's extremely good. D like the small corporation that I work for. There's no pension plan there's no type of, F uh, savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for. There's really, I think you're allowed so many times, F uh, I think two or three days a w, a year. It's not accumulative, type of sick leave F uh, D you know, things like that. C So I've been looking at big corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans, had the big health, health care, F uh, you had your insurance C and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a, a very small place. F Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations. C And <<very faint>>, Uhhuh. Sure. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Is it a union? Uhhuh. F Oh, that's pretty good. Uhhuh. Sure. Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean C and that's true. E I mean, yo, i, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure. Yeah. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. D Well, that's it, D you know, C and, C and I've kind of looked around, F uh, at that, F uh, too. C Because, F uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large, I'm talking D like hugh companies like Three M, F uh, I'm, F uh, Honeywell, F uh, Texas Instruments <laughter> I know people that are, that have vacation times, and bene, benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation. You bring it up to the owner C and it's like come on, D you know. Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer. C And, C and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand C so that money is spent <clicking>, <Music> Uhhuh. Right. D Well I've worked for, F uh, D well I worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile. C And the only, they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they, D you know, they're fairly, even though they're a large scale company, they're very, the offices, the individual offices are very small C and now I work for the Framingham <<mispronounced>> school tea, system because I'm a teacher. C And, F uh, we have much better benefits, D you know, in the system. We have a good pension plan. F Uh, let me see, we have a profit sharing plan to a degree. Right. C And we have the eye glasses, the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw all the town employees in together. Yeah. . Really. Oh! Right. The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problems, especially the retired ones. My father's retired from the town of Framingham C and he said that they haven't gotten a, a cost of living raise in over five years. C And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired C and C but I hear that bill is in the Senate right now C and it's, hopefully will go through. C But, F uh, D you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers. They took in the whole town plus all D you know, F Uh, we have the teachers union which helps out a lot, C but the town of Framingham pays the benefits C and that's all the town workers, water and sewer C and where it's a very large town, it's D actually, should be a city C but they kept it a town. F Uh, where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor <laughter>. Right, C because of most of our, D you know, the town employees, as far as, F uh, electoral positions, are parttime. C So it works out good <laughter> because we reap the benefits of it C and, F uh, C but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary. Right <laughter>. Right <music> <noise>.
