Okay, Jerry, I guess tonight's topic is about recycling. C And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano. Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your garbage can. F Uh, you can put out newspaper, you can put out glass, you can put out aluminum cans, you can put, put out certain types of plastic material C and that is on a roll out effort right now. Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, F uh, participate right now, C but, F uh, that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so. C And those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum. C And I think, F uh, overall that's an, an excellent opportunity C because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, F uh, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for o, not only the people that are living today, but for the future also. C So, How about your community? <Laughter>. Dye Mound? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Sounds like a place where I grew up <laughter>. D Well, I like it. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, good. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. <Cough>. Oh. <Laughter>. D Well, let's hope not. You can be, F uh, get in trouble for that. Uhhuh. D Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it? Okay, okay. Yes, until you release it. All right. I think, Yes. F Oh, <laughter> yes, I sure do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. <Laughter>. Yes. No. D Well, great. That's excellent. <Laughter> D Well, F uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that C and we might be able to incorporate some of that. One thing, Right. Uhhuh. Right. Oh. Yes. D Well, that's a great idea, that's a great idea. Products. Yes. Uhhuh. Yes, they will. Exactly. F Huh. <Laughter> D Well, that's a full time job. Yes, D well, I've found out, too, that, F uh, D you know, a couple years ago, we've always been recycling <noise> newspaper for the last twelve years, C and at one time we could get a pretty good return, F uh, with the Boy Scouts. We could take and collect the newspaper, Uhhuh. All right. Yeah, F uh, I was read, <Laughter> My community, that's cute. I live in a place called Dye Mound. Or Dye Community. C And it's not a city, <lipsmack> not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, I can't even see their house C and, F uh, Yeah, E I mean, F uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness. Literally. C And, F uh, D well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, E I mean, to the asphalt, we're out there. C And, F uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things. I'm building our house right now C and I'm going to incorporate into my, F uh, garage area a weight activated, F uh, crusher. C So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, F uh, pressure side of a, F uh, hydraulic cylinder. C And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer. Hope, hopefully, it's not my wife. <Laughter>. D Well, I thought I'd, D you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. I don't know if you're familiar with that operation, C but, what you do is you just build up the pressure C and then you go over and release it C and then it just, it just drops, D you know. Very similar, yeah. D Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, C but you, it won't go down. Until you pull the pin, yeah. D Anyway I have another, F uh, recycling method I use. You know all that junk mail you get? The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that. D Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, D you know, happen to gather up. C Because, F uh, D well, like I say, we live a way C and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard. C And I don't like that C so I don't do that. C So I take it C and I send, C and I mail it back to them. I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff. Yeah. D Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, F uh, E or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items. For instance, F uh, I saw a thing on, F uh, NOVA, A I think it was the other day. This guy has designed recyclable materials, E I mean recyclable items. Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing. D See, C so, plastic, it's all out of plastic. If it's metal, it's all out of metal. It's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff. C And, C and, in, incorporating, D you know, reusable materials into your, F uh, D you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale. Make it financially, F uh, attractive to recycle C and somebody will find a way to make money at it. C And, D Well, there is a guy in Dallas, that's all he does. He collects trash. D You know, C and, Yeah, D well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
