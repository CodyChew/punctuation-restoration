F Uh, D well, let's see. <Laughter> Five. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well any number is nice, let me tell you. Yeah. It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think. <Laughter>. Oh. Yeah, C but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You can tell. How to just entertain themselves. Yeah, yeah. It's a problem for any child C and you take one that's used to being, F uh, busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference. F uh, keeps you busy. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, that's great. No, our last daughter, she did not want to go to school. She's, F uh, C but she's married now, they built a home just a couple miles from us. C And, D Well, we did not do it right all the time <laughter>. With our first boy, we persuaded him to start here, C and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home. I think the main thing is to, F uh, right now, I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in. F Uh, and take what they are interested in, C and then, then start looking for schools. No, not necessarily. C But, Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have. He wanted to go to Embrey Rey, Riddle C and we talked him into going local here first. C And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh. He went to aeronautical, F uh, F oh, just learning to work on engines and that. F Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is <laughter>. C And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally. C And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing. F Uh, C but, C but right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut C and they build and rebuild non jet engines. F Uh, the other ones, F uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she wanted to, F uh, we did not want her to go, C but she went to Erie, to Gannan University. F Uh, or Gannan College, I am not sure which it is, college, I guess. F Uh, she went there two years C and it was more expensive C and she soon realized, D you know, even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and finished at Clarion. Because, it, F uh, saved her quite a bit of money C and she got really the same basic education that she wanted. C And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also. And, F uh, did very well there. C And they have all really got, F uh, they have all really got really good jobs. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. F Uh, yeah, they kind of had that, they just expected to go. Daphne never went, she always said she would never go to college. She said, I, I always thought she would change her mind, D you know, C but she did not. C And there's nothing wrong with that, D you know, if, college is not for everybody. C But, F uh, it, it does make a difference in your pa, wage income. I think it's what they want out of life, C because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, D you know, a much better income. D Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state. D You know, that boggles, my mind. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Okay, did you go to college? You did. D See <noise> it makes a difference. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Some place else. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Different life styles, yes, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. It's quite a bit different. D See that's the way we are, we are more of a rural type of an area C and it does make a difference. I, they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking. Yeah, not really. C Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help, with a more expensive college. C And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, D you know, they are better off. Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school. F Uh, we, we did all we could, C but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go. How many, you said yours are all, E I mean, that sounds like an army. F Oh, lord. That is an army, I came from a family of six, C and I have only got two, C and they are, one... D Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not parenting, that's a hobby. C But, D Well, do not tell that to all my friends. They are into quality time. I am into getting through the day. <Noise> <<it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes>>. D Well I, I, I can spot a kid who really, D you know, whose parents spend every, quality time with them, D you know, outside of the work day. C And when I take care of some people's kids, D you know, when they, when they have teachers' holidays, and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, that are usually in day care, C and you can spot them, because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around. Yeah. Really. It's not a problem for my two, they are only eighteen months apart <sigh>. They can find things to do and mess around, and plot and scheme and everything else. You, did all five of yours complete college? D Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then? <Sigh>. Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Sigh>. How about the other four, other three who went? Uhhuh. <Inhaling> When they were, D like in junior high and high school, E I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and, Uhhuh. F Uh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, I was, I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making, as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired. Yeah, I went, F uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln, <Sigh> because Lincoln is where, where my parents live. C And there really, there really was not a choice, E I mean the finances, F uh, dictated that you had to go there. I kind of, I am not going to say I resent it, C but I was, D well D you know, one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, D you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, and <inhaling> the whole bit, F uh, <noise> my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state, or anyplace else, C and I just knew that the finances, D you know, would not support it. <Inhaling> If I had known how, A not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, F uh, scholarship, to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, D you know, have gone <inhaling>. D Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston. C And that was, F uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened, E I mean I was, taken out of my element, D you know, the homogeny midwest, which is a lovely place to grow up, and put into someplace else where, people thought differently, looked differently, sounded differently, D you know, different life style. C And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. D Now my kids, I keep saying that, F uh, D you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could. C And I do not know, D you know, what the realities, D you know, is going to look like, D you know, we are putting money away already. F Uh, C but I really think it's important <inhaling> to put these children someplace where, in addition to, <inhaling> D you know, them getting an education, they really need a, D you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community C and, An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different. You should not. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh.
