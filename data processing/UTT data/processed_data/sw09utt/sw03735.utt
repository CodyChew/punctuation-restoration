Hello. Okay, I pressed one C so I guess we're recording now. Okay, F um. <Laughter>. F Um. F Um. Okay, D well, I've, I have had some because I was working for P I E, C and they went bankrupt C so I've got quite a bit of spare time right now. C And I've been making dolls, cloth dolls. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, Yeah, it's a, they're all cloth. It's not, F uh, any porcelain at all. Yeah C and I make the clothes for them. C And. F Um, no, you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop. I made some of them with that hair C and then, F uh, don't ask me what the other hair I made, it looked like, F um, it looked, D well, I made some of them with regular wigs. I went to the flea markets and bought, D you know, D like the wigs for a dollar. Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on. They looked really cute <laughter>. I have sold five of them, so far. Uhhuh. I just have to get a place where, D you know, I can sell them D actually. . F Uh, if I would just work all day long, making the clothes and everything, probably about two and a half days. Uhhuh. D So. Yes I really do. C And, then I also crochet C and, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. I tried knitting first, C but, I don't know, I, I didn't like it. C So then I went to crocheting, C but now I want to learn how to knit again. D You know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I, in fact, I just bought a serger in December. Yeah. I haven't done everything on it yet, D you know, C but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it. D You know, especially making the seams and things like that D you know, it's, <cough> it's got such a professional finish on them. Yeah. C So I like that. C And. D Well, fiftyseven's not young, C but no, my son's, has been married for almost ten years, C but they don't have any children. C So, I just make clothes for my dolls. <Laughter>. Just, D you know, just D like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll. C And they, they turned out really cute. Yeah, you got to have a pattern for the body D you know. C And, F uh, Yes. Yes. Aren't they cute? Uhhuh. No, I, I bought a bunny pattern one time, C but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse. Uhhuh. D See, it was too pointed. C So I tore it back apart again, C and I haven't tried another one. No, C but I bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of, C but I haven't made it yet. No, I don't paint, except I stenciled my wall. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? F Oh, yeah, I, my neighbor did it first C and I seen her house C and I saw how beautiful it looked, C so then I decided D well, I was going to do it, C and F uh, it turned out really, really good. F Uh, mostly flowers D you know. I've done it in the all, F uh, all my rooms. I put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom, Hi. Okay. F Um, as far as spare time, they talked about, I don't, I think, who has any spare time <laughter>? I've got a, a six year old and a, F um, D well, my baby's one today. Today's his birthday. C And I'm also, I'm expecting, C and, so, I, I don't know, I haven't had much spare time lately <laughter> C but, F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, have you? Oh. You sew the bodies and everything? C So, C so you just sew everything up, huh? Oh. Uhhuh. What kind do they have yarn hair C or, F Oh, uhhuh. Oh. F Oh, did you? F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, my goodness. It sounds like you're creative. F Uh, do you sell them? F Oh, have you? Yeah, I bet. How long does it take you to make one? F Oh, really? Oh. Do you enjoy it? Yeah. Uhhuh. I, I, I can crochet and knit. F Um, D actually, I started an <laughter> afghan, C but it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago C and it's sitting in my closet half done right now, C but, it's a knitting one. C And, F Oh, didn't you. Oh. I en, Yeah, I enjoy knitting. I, I kind of like that, C but I just, like I say, haven't done it for a while. C And I do like sewing sometimes. I, I've made a few of the, D you know, just the little valence curtains in my house, and things like that. C But, it, it's just finding the time for <laughter> these things that you you enjoy. C But, F oh, I would love one of these. F Oh, that's neat. F Oh, those are wonderful aren't they. F Oh, yeah, that, C and that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff. It'd be nice to have that. F Oh, that's neat. D Well, do you have, F um, F uh, I guess you're kind of young, I was going to say, do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for. F Oh, uhhuh. F Oh, well. D Well, how did you get involved in that? C So you did buy a pattern, and then started from there. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Ha, have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress? Yeah, I, I did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those. Yeah, I have quite a few of them D actually in my house, I, C and most of them I have bought, F um, already clothed, C but I did I did make the dress on one, C and I kind of made the pattern up. It's not, it's probably not the best <child_talking> C but <laughter>, F Oh, it did? Oh. Oh. You haven't sewn it back up, huh? Uhhuh. F Uh, do you do any kind of painting or anything? Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. I tri, I tried that, I did, I, I ended up just stenciling a, F um, a blind, D like a, just a roller shade. C But, I, I can, I had a hard time stenciling. For some reason I just couldn't do it. C And people have told me it's very easy. D Well. What design did you use? F Oh, uhhuh. And, what room? Have you?
