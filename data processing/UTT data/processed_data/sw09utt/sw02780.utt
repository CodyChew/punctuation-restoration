Yeah, I think, F um, this is a tough subject because, F uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, F uh, the political views are really different. I, F uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues, I guess D like, D like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion C but D like gun control and, F uh, day care an things like that, C and there are some very different views, F uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, D you know. Yeah, D well being in, in Baltimore D see, Maryland is, F um, is sort of, F um, is prob, as, as a hub of liberalism <laughter>, D you know, compared to the country, F uh, D you know, very, F uh, in, in many ways, F uh, very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York, F uh, I, aren't actually as liberal, Maryland is a very liberal, F uh, state D so, D so, where here we have, F um, we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation C and most people in Maryland vote for that, D you know. D So, it really is a different, F um, Yeah, that's, that's right talk to, I had to talk about gun control with somebody C and I talked with a woman who actually, D you know, h, had just purchased a gun that day, and was going target shooting, D you know, C and it was very different it was a whole, different view. It's really, F um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, D you know, at one time I just sat here and thought, D well, how can anybody believe that C because I'd really never met people that did, C and now, I talk to people that do. D So that's, it's really interesting. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <laughter> Yeah, isn't it funny. <laughter> Uhhuh. F Uh. Yeah. Yeah D well you can possess 'em here too C but <breathing> They have to be they're registered C and F Uh, D like F uh the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues, and F um. <lipsmack> You have the seven day waiting period. Yeah that's F uh that's Yeah. Yeah that's true that's very true That's C and that's the way I guess most of the F um the political organizations work D you know the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose C and C and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance D you know there's there's always that difficulty <lipsmack> <breathing> F Um I would say I'm probably liberal yeah yeah Sure D Well I'll tell you. I I think D you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen do you know what I mean? It's only because they make a big stink over it. C But I I guess D actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity They're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech C But I I would never Yeah. <lipsmack> Yeah. <breathing> Well it's free that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to C and I F uh F uh the the <breathing> the whole aspect of being able to display your F uh your ideas D you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that <breathing> F Uh, though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself I I <breathing> I think F uh D you know C but I I still what the stan flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can <breathing> show their opinion <breathing> then they should be allowed <lipsmack> F uh Unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and wellbeing D you know C but I I think that's I guess that's I thin that's my opinion Yeah I guess you feel differently. F Uh, no C but I think that's that's F uh it's that's taxpayer's money. <breathing> If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine C but that that's <breathing> D you know that's destruction and of F uh public property and whatever. No I don't know I guess the symbolism F oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government. F Uh I think that's what's made democracy Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well that's that's true Yeah <breathing> C But I think I I g Yeah <breathing> I I d I guess the idea D you know they always keep saying D like the framers. <breathing> F Um. <lipsmack> there F uh one of the Republican the appointees for the jud the judicial bench <breathing> C and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution <breathing> what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down. C And F Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this coun the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government C and you can display that. F Uh, I Yeah, I g <breathing> C and C and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable. <lipsmack> F Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. Yeah C Because, realistically, D like for you for you you don't think it's right <breathing> C And I would never do it. I I love this country too much, C and that symbol means a lot to me. F Um. C But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them D you know. Yeah. Yes. No. Right. Yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. I agree there too. I agree with you there too. I I the F um I I it's I find it you know personally disgusting C But I don't think that I don't think that F uh we have a right to stop somebody from that D you know the same I don't know I guess I get I get F uh all mixed up inside. <breathing> when, Yeah it g when it's F uh it's an emotional issue, <breathing> C and you sit C and you try and think about it logically C and C and C and D you know you try to say to yourself <breathing> D now emotionally this is a disgusting thing, F uh C but logically F um even D you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, F uh D you know <breathing> I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion, C but they would vote pro choice. C because you know That's just a disgusting thing D you know somebody <breathing> an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, D you know C but Yeah. <lipsmack> C but it that's F uh that's what I mean, D see, mo C but C but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing, C and it evokes an emotional response. I think <breathing> that's the hardest thing, I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't D you know No, no <breathing> I think the F um <lipsmack> sometimes I guess what did I read recently the F um th the F uh Christian F uh point is is always the point of D well it's at conception C but then F um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. C And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology. <lipsmack> D so then that D so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. D So it's I don't know. It's very it's it's F uh D you know It's a it's a topsyturvy world C and it's really something how F um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within F um <lipsmack> within a, Yeah C and how Yeah how it'll sway from one e one extreme to another. <lipsmack> F Uh I think that F uh D you know I I just read something I think in TIME magazine F uh about F um protest Uhhuh. D Well, D now you, you say two different parts of the country what, are, are, are you referring to yourself C or, <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Uh, D well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas C and you're asking to be lynched. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, it's very true, D now I'm a, F uh, New Yorker by birth. Although I claim Florida as my home now, F uh, I have two sons living down there C but I also have two sons living elsewhere, one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi. C But I lived in Te, in Florida for ten years C and I kind of like it down there, C but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far. I think F uh, <breathing> D well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal. <breathing> E I mean they p they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons. <inhaling> C But they F uh sh quickly did away with it. I think in the next session they they F uh modified it <breathing> C but it's still legal to own <breathing> or possess weapons in F uh F uh Florida. <breathing> <breathing> The the one week F uh seven day the delay Uh huh. D Well I don't mind that too much I'm I'm with the N R A myself. C And F uh, F uh Really the only objection we have <breathing> Is F uh you you give a little C and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more. <breathing> <breathing> Yeah. <breathing> <breathing> <lipsmack> D Well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal? <breathing> D Well let me ask you this then. How is your what is your feeling about F uh F uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag? F Huh. D Well now wait a minute the there you just said it. It's their right by freedom of speech? What does speech have to do with burning a flag? <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> D Now F uh D Well I I still go back to... <breathing> Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building? <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> F Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and F uh F uh F uh what a public F uh symbol. <breathing> F Uh yeah C but here again I go back to the second amendment You can disagree by s b freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action. D Now I am I am adamantly against that. <breathing> <breathing> <breathing> Uhhuh. F huh. <breathing> Yeah. Uhhuh. <breathing> No. Uhhuh. <breathing> D Well D here again we F uh even though you F uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself. Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country. F Uh, F um so long as it's their possession. D Ok, you're you're that's <breathing> fine up to there except that F uh, <breathing> th what that flag symbolizes is F uh F uh is this country, C and I used to know as a Boy Scout C but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it. C And, to me that's F uh F uh black eye to every man that ever p F uh carried a weapon or killed for his country. Uhhuh. <breathing> It's It's very easy to do. <breathing> <breathing> F Uh Uhhuh. <breathing> D Well I think it should be permitted under certain circus circumstances. <breathing> Uhhuh. F Huh. D Well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a F uh fetus a human? <breathing> <breathing> F Huh. <breathing> <breathing> C Or they on their o within the own F uh <breathing> society, it can vary. Uhhuh.
