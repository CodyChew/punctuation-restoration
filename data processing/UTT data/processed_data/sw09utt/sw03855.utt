I pushed it. D So, how do you use your credit cards? <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's me. I won't use one that I have to pay an annual fee D you know, C and, F um, I'm, F uh, like you. I, I use it, D well, to buy my gas with, my Sh, my Shell credit card, I use that, C and then D like my Emporium card and, F uh, Weinstocks card, I use that, C but I'm like you. I usually pay it off as soon as I get my bill. Why I don't just write a check, I don't know. D You know, it's just really weird, C but I, I don't carry a lot of cash with me, because I'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse. Yeah, D you know, enough for a phone call C and that's about all. C But, F uh, other than that, that's the, that's the way I use them. I know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got, they c, they can't charge any more, D you know, C and I think that's terrible. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, C because if anything ever happens that you do need to, D you know, you have excellent credit, D why, it really does help. <whispering>. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, D well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because yo, there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing C and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head. I know. It just, F uh, D you know, it just seems like they're, somebody's always watching. C So, I just don't, I don't carry money. I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off, D you know. Right. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. C And, D you know, some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything D you know, I don't know why they don't, unless you have to spend a certain amou, I don't know, A but I notice that some of them don't even look, D you know, they just slide it in there and pass it back to you D you know, C so I don't think that's right. I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, D you know. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, let's see, what else can I say about credit cards. F Um. Yeah, I don't, I don't, F uh, that, that's that Sears Discovery Card, is that what that? Yeah. D Now I don't have that one, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Oh, E you mean, F uh, for, for your using your credit card you get D like a rebate or something? Uhhuh. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. F Um, I see. Yeah D well, I'll, Okay. F Oh, we use them for, paying our gas and for paying, F uh, just about anything, because, F um, we don't like to pay for our checks <laughter>. C So we use it quite a bit C but we, we pay off every month, though, C so we never have to pay interest C and we always, we never get the, the credit cards if there's a monthly, or a yearly charge. We always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free. C So we never have to pay anything extra. Yeah, we just don't think it's worth it. C So. D See, D well, you, I don't do it either <laughter>. Yeah. Yes, exactly, that's how I fe, E I mean, it's a rare day when I even have seventyfive cents in my purse. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, C because it's really, it helps your, if you have good credit, D you know, it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something. Yeah, C and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases, D like whenever we go on trips, we always, D you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever. C And then, F um, D you know, we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later C and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it, we come out a lit, even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever, first off, and then pay for it later. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, even if it's five bucks, even. Yeah. C And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, D you know, you notice it within, I think it's twentyfour hours, you can report it in, C and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, D you know, whatever payments you had, C and if whoever tried to, F uh, D you know, credit it to the hilt, you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it, C and then D you know, you can have your card back with pretty good rating, D you know, because you can pay fifty dollars, but not, D you know maybe five thousand or whatever. I know. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, sure. E I mean it's just a precaution for everybody. Yeah, D so. F Um. F Oh, I also use, like to use Discover when I can, because they give you some money back every year. Yeah, yeah. D Well, we just started doing that, C and you know, what it comes in handy for when you're buying things like, F um, tickets for the train or, F um, airplanes because they'll give you some money back, D you know, C and it's only a little bit, C but, E I mean, it's still something. We got two fifty last year C and so it's, D you know, it helps out here and there. C So. Yeah, they give you, I think they start giving you D like a half a percent back, which doesn't sound like a thing, C but when you, D you know, when you add up everything you've, you've charged up on the Discover card for a year C and they give you a half percent of that, C and that adds up to, D you know, two fifty or something. C And so that's what, C and I know we're going to get back more this year, because they, D you know, we spent a little bit more probably, C and they do it for how long you've been a member I think, too C and they increase the percentage a little bit.
