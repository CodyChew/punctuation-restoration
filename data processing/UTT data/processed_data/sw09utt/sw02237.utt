<Noise> Okay <laughter>. F Uh, D well, we probably have about three months, approximately. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. We live on a, used to be a farm, C but we don't farm much, we, F uh, C but we do have a garden. Oh. I wish I could be doing that <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. You've had more freezing this Winter, E or this, A yeah, Winter, I think. More bad weather. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Are you, do you work, C or are you retired C or you, Uhhuh. Uhhuh <laughter>. F Uh, my husbands retired. C But he's not a gardener. He, he, he's been helping me more, C but he really isn't, F uh, real crazy about gardening. F Uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Oh yeah. C But it's a pleasure to, like you said, it's good to get outside, C and C and I like, I like my garden too <laughter>. We didn't have to, we have just a small garden, C but we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space we, we didn't have too good luck with it, C because the, F uh, we had a couple of good, real good wind storms, C and it really damaged the corn C so we didn't get too much corn, last year. F uh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh that's great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. We don't, we don't usually cover ours. We did a few different times sometimes we've covered with the plastic, C and other years we've tried newspapers C and, F uh, C but we generally don't, we do our watering from our spring. Yeah. We have an old fashioned pipe sitting, that, D you know, water runs into C and, my husband set up a pump that runs, it runs first down C and then it stops, C and when the water comes up, it comes on again, C and we use that to water our garden <noise>, with C so, Oh F I do. I do. I love it, <Laughter>. I'd rather be doing that, than housework <laughter>. F Uh, <throat_clearing> not a who, <noise> D well, not a whole lot. I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that <talking> <<people in background>> we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the, the, Yeah. F Uh. Uhhuh. Do you go more for natural, keeping them off naturally, C or do you, use insecticides? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, our lawn, is, is a big lawn because, because we live out in the country, C and so we were not, our lawn is not perfect, D you know, it's just the it's just a lawn <laughter>. Uhhuh. Do you eat any of them? F Oh, did, D well, did, does your wife ever make, F uh, bake in a hot bacon dressing, D like for, salad? F Oh it's delicious C and it goes real good on dandelions. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. use the greens, if you get them when they're young and tender, D you know, before they have grown too, too tall, C because they do get a little stringy. C But, F uh, they're kind of fun to, to try, get a, get a few C and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, C but I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back, C and he's been having trouble with C so, wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower, C so, it takes about four hours to cut our grass. C And, we have, we have hills. I'm afraid of the hills <laughter> C but, I'm getting on to it, I just pretend they're not there, C and I just go ahead and do it <laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's great. great. That's, a lot of people don't have that much space even. Uhhuh. C So you have all the conveniences of, a city, yeah, and, and the country also. <Laughter> D Well, you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything. Rolly Polly what? Is it a bug, You mean? A worm? A cutworm? Not a grub worm? Oh. F Uh. Uhhuh. I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind, they could be. You find them under bricks usually, and that. They're not a slug. Not a, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh really. They were not hard are they? Are they a hard worm? They're not a hard. F Huh. F Oh, are they black then? C But they roll up. I can't think of what kind they would be. Uhhuh. I'm no help on that, then. Because, I can't think of what they are. What they would be. I think you have a lot more insects down there even than, than what we have. I know, my brother had trouble with fire ants, and that even. F Uh, yeah. C And they be can be a real <noise> dickens. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah <laughter> you keep trading them <laughter>. Uhhuh. Ours are going to be coming out. Now our cancer society sales daffodils. Right now, they're, they're big now. C So, we, we have daffodils, here in the house because of the cut flowers, C but they're just beginning to come out and bud. F Uh, Uhhuh. F uh, uhhuh. F uh, they're such a nice bright early Spring, color. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And they're, beautiful too. They're beautiful. <Lipsmack> F Oh my. Yeah. Yeah. We won't have too much here for another couple of months yet. Yeah. Yeah. We're ha, it's raining today. D Well, our grass, like I said is just grass. We really didn't plant anything. It's just, I suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even. C And, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It's probably, very pretty. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. We have some people that have done their lawns, C and, F uh, D So, do you have, do you have the long, I guess not, not if there's, D see I was raised in New York, C but I guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season, do you? Do do you do your own gardening? Do you. F Huh. See I got mine in, D well, let's see, I put in pepper plants this weekend. Yeah. I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen C and, I enjoy tinkering with it, D you know, it's pretty hot down here during the Summer, we hit, D you know, a hundred, hundred and two sometimes, C but, D you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff, like that. Yeah. I can, usually I can put in, F oh probably midMarch, I can put anything in the ground, D you know, beets, and onions, and stuff like that. C But then I have to wait for my, tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it. Yeah. We've, had just a few, D you know, that freezes a little here and there, C but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April, C and it's pretty tough. No. I work, F uh I'm only forty years old. I have to work, <Laughter>. F Uh, I, I really enjoy it, it gives me time outdoors, C and, D you know, I'm a golfer, C but, it gives me time outdoors, and time around my house, C and I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn, I usually have a pretty nice lawn, it's a lot of work D you know, C but it's, Yeah, it is. Uhhuh. F Oh yeah. We're going through that, we going through the dust storms down here now, C so, C but I, F uh, what I did with my garden, is I have a, a two by six frame that's five by ten. I have two of them sitting side by side C and then I put, F uh, D like, a black plastic, it's really not a black plastic. They call it Wedet C and I put that down, C and then I put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that C and I use a, one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where C so I waste it up and down there a couple of times, C and I only have to water about two hours a week C and it's pretty nice. Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting. Oh. F Oh you have a spring, how nice. Uhhuh. F Oh that's, that's pretty nice. C But you actually enjoy it, F huh? Do you? Get out there on your hands and knees, and crawl around. I, I can imagine. You all have much trouble up there, with insects C or, With the worms? Yeah. I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs, and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet. Yeah, I try to, no I, F uh, F uh, try not to use any insecticides at all. I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn, C but, I, sometimes I can't manage. Yeah. D Well, mine's full of dandelions, now, C so, No, I never have. I don't know how to prepare them. No. Huhuh. Really. F Huh. I've never eaten dandelions D now I've tried dandelion wine C but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I'll try that. I sure will <noise>. F Oh, Oh. Yow. C So you all are into, C so you all are into the lawn, big time, F huh. Yeah, I only get, D well, I guess I got my, my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre then I have a pretty nice backyard, C and D you know, I've got enough room to throw horseshoes. D You know, couple of other, No, C and it's nice. I'm just inside the city limits, I'm probably a mile, mile and a half inside the city limits, C and I'm only a mile, and a half from work. Yeah. It's pretty nice. I have the room outside I need, C and I don't really have all the room in the house I need C but, No. I have a question to ask you about gardening though. D You know, those, what are they called, the, they called, F uh, rolly polly bugs, that's what my son calls them anyway. Rolly Polly bugs. The ones that roll up in a ball. I don't know what they're called. They look like they've got, Yeah. Yeah. No. It's not like a, no. You find them under bricks and all that stuff, where it's moist, C and if, if you touch them, they roll up in a ball. I don't know what they call them. C But I'm plagued with those things, C and I haven't figured out, I even called the nursery, . I, I don't know. Yeah, under bricks, or under wood, C or D you know, if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long, they get in there. They usually come out at night, C but, you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around, No. A slug is actually kind of slimy C and these are just, he plays with them all time, he picks them up and rolls them across the patio. <Laughter>. No. No. They're not real hard, They're like a, water bug, of sorts, I don't know what, they're called. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you touch them, they roll up. C But, I'm plagued with those. D You know, I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone. D You know, we don't really, we only freeze down here in January, and February, at the most. D You know. Yeah. I got fire, ants too. C And, you, spray in one part of your lawn, C and they just move to, another part. C So you got to, spray your whole yard, C and your, your, your neighbor gets them, C and then he sprays his yard, C and you get them back again <laughter>. Yeah. C But we're not doing too bad down here really, D you know, the daffodils are out C and, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. D See mine are up and bloomed already C so, already. They sure are, pretty, I like them, yeah. C And then in, in my back flower bed I have, F uh, tiger lilies C and they bloom in, D you know, late June, mid, July. Yeah, they are. They real, beautiful. They're, they're nice and green, D you know, they're, F uh, they're up above a foot, maybe eighteen inches. They come up real pretty, every year, no problem. Is it still pretty cool up there? D Well, do you all have a, what kind o gra, grass do you grow up there? Do you grow, F uh, Bermuda or, Yeah. Yeah. D See we, I have Bermuda, in my yard, C and I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there, C but, Bermuda seems to be, Yeah. Bermuda seems to be pretty, good down here.
