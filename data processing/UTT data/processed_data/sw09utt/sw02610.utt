D So, how do you feel about the metric system? Yeah, C and it's, I forget how many millimeters. C So you used the metric? F Uh, yeah, yeah. F Uh, yeah, yeah. F Uh, I work in metal fab C and tenths of inches are, are normal. C And, D you know, me, D you know, it is broken up in, D you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch. Yes, I am. I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle C and, C and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years C and the metric system comes easy to me. C But my... Right. Yeah, yeah, trans, yeah. To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, F uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it... Yeah, I drink beer. Yeah, whiskey is in liters. C And, C and the next, yeah, point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I always wondered about that myself. C And, C and they had quarts at the same time though. Yeah. It's... Liters. Yeah. It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop C and, F uh, everything's still inches. Everything's still fractions of inches, or pa, or tenths or thousandths, or, or... Yes. it is a mental thing. It is a conversion thing. Right. Yeah, yeah. C But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric. We have a eightynine Chevy Blazer. C And before that we had a Horizon. F Uh, D you know, Plymouth Horizon? C And both of them were a mismatch of both <<pause>> American and metric. F Uh, okay. The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada. C And the starter was Bosch American, C so. Yeah, yeah. It was, it was annoying. One, one half of the starter wa, D you know, three bolts on the starter C and two of them were American C and one of them was metric. C And, F uh, you go from the, F uh, water pump up to the radiator C and on the water pump, it was all metric. C And, C and on, D you know, the factory fittings, D you know, the factory, F uh screw lock F uh, F uh, radiator hose clamps. Yeah. Right. It's it's not a problem either way. Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car. C And you go to look at it C and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric. C and, C and, you're never quite sure, D well, is that a metric bolt. Right, right. It, it can be annoying C and my other con, concern is, is the American government going to force us to go. F Oh, absolutely. Yeah, Yeah. They're not going to change that to meters. It will always be. Twelve. Yeah. There's twelve troy ounces to the pound. Yeah. C And, C and is that going to change too? F Uh, se, I don't remember. I, I read it. C And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume? It's all metric all ready. C And what will a shot be? Will a shot be an ounce? C And the other one's two point one kis, C and, C and you're, you're lost. F Oh, yeah. The economy. F Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. F Uh, a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling. Personal tools to be able to do his job. F Uh, tools for set up and for measurement. F Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator, it's a hundred dollars. F Uh, five tenths indic, F uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. F Uh, five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars. You got to have, F uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars. You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. F Uh, one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars. A two to three for eighty dollars. A three to four for eighty dollars. Real fast. Real, real fast. Edge finders and... D Well, I know, C because, okay. Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches. D You know. What size hole? As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole? Yeah, yeah. D Well and thread, <T V> F Oh, I like it. I, I, I have a foreign, D actually I have more than one foreign automobile. C And I, I, I find the, F uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters, I was trying to build a shed C and they give you these measurements like fortytwo and three eighths inches C and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, F uh... D Well, no. What we did was wind up using, C and you just go, you just go down C and, C and you get out the, the, so many inches C and, C and we just marked a little bit less than that, F uh, which is somewhat awkward C but had it been millimeters, you could have done. I think what's interesting, the way engineering people do is they, they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, F uh, decimal inches. Do you, are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that? <Dishes> <talking>. D Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, F uh, metric type things like... I think it's interesting you we, D you know, when yo, you go out there C and you're looking for a wrench C and you want the next size larger. I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds. D Well, D now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch. C But some of them, like, like, twentyseven C and, C and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, F uh, don't translate. Yeah. C and, C and you've got to go over there and try it C and I suppose, D you know, I need a larger one. I need a smaller one. E I mean obviously you can look at it and say D well, D anyway. I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't, I don't know, do you, do you drink adult beverages? We, th, have you noticed that, F um, that a lot of the, F um, a lot of... Yes. It's D like a fifth, D like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange. What's a fifth of whiskey? <Laughter>. It was a marketing ploy. Yeah. C But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, F um, they could, F uh, they could, F uh, they could sell five C and, C and, F um, it was <laughter> simply a ploy to, to get people, D you know to buy, to buy more for, it's, F uh, I find that interesting. C But it's D like, D you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in on, one liter bottles C and, F um, I, I think it's kind of generational. Although I must admit that, that I am not, I ca, I'm not conversant in saying, D you know, that's three centimeters away. E I mean, or, or, or... Yeah. . Yeah. It's, it's hard to think though. It's like a mill, D you know. We, we do, F uh, F um, D well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co, bond wire on on semiconductor devices. C And D well, what's a mill C and... Yeah. Don't you find that interesting? F Uh, that they, that <laughter> that they're doing that, F uh, in any field, for ho, why, why, why pieces, could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't. F Oh, okay. The bolts were, were Eng, were, were English then. Now that's strange. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Essentially they do that though C because if, if you look at General Motors, the size and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler. If they all went, if they all went metric, C but in a sense, F um, D you know, it's like when yo, a measurement though, when, when you put, F uh, D you know, one point four three two inches, whe, when you're milling something, F uh you simply set your, F uh, equipment, C or, C or you measu, C or you got your calipers there C and, C and you measure, D you know, you mic it to see if it's accurate C and. No. Yeah. Yeah. You get you a pair of metric pliers, right <laughter>? C And you beat on it and a metric hammer <laughter>. F Oh, I think, I don't think so. I, I think that, th, F uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, D well, if it happens, if it, C because it, there a lot of things that, that, F uh, F um, like sports, D you know. It's a hundred meter. C And, F uh, F uh, C but automobile races if it, I don't think they'd ever, it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred. They're not going to... Yeah. C And, C and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, D you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, F uh, you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold. How many ounces of gold, D you know. I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something. It had, has, F uh, gold plated, F uh, header. C And, C and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce. Yeah. D Now that makes, D you know. D Well, E I mean, C and, C and then there's a metric ton C and then there's a ton. C But what's a metric ton? I don't know. Yeah. And, and then, but then the medicine. And, and some of these other things and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas, milliliter. Yeah. C And, C and so, F um, C but, C but when you go to order a drink, F um, D you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's F uh... I don't know. C And, C and, C but, D you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, D you know, D well this box is, is, F uh, is, is twelve ounces C and, C and this one's, F uh, F uh, three pounds, F um, C and you... That's right. C And, C and I don't know. I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone. I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems. Yes. <Breathing> Yeah. C But, C but are, are the tools that, F uh, if you're cutting, are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha, for set up? F Huh. C So you've got thousands of dollars or so. I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools. Yes. C But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning... Yeah. C But whe, you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, E I mean, a real simple thing, like gee, I need a hole there. Yeah. Yeah. C And, C and what, C but the thing is then you've got to with screws C and that's the other issue. F Uh, the pitch and <T V> <dishes> <talking>...
