Okay, all set. <Laughter> Good morning. Let's see, music, F um, D well, I play a couple of instruments. I try to. F Um, clarinet is my primary instrument, C and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often. <Laughter> How about yourself? Uhhuh. F Uh. F Oh, wow. Wow. That's great. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D So are you a professional musician? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, I understand, yeah. I'm in one community band here, C and that's just, D well, we rehearse once a week. We generally have a concert every other week C and, Yeah <laughter>. That's a lot. No, we sure don't. D Well, one thing is, we have a summer ser, summer series, C and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out, outdoor stage set up C and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer, yeah, C and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements, C and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, F um, because, D you know, F uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row. Oh yes, definitely, we really do. D You know, you get your little Sousa book C and you just flip <laughter> through it, and that sort of thing. It really depends on who shows up. F Um, C and it's always a mystery, C because it actually doesn't matter who shows up, it matters what instruments they brought, C because so many people switch instruments so often. C But, F um, yeah, in the winter we do more concert stuff C and, F Um, I think there's about seventy. Yeah, there's a lot. C But, on any given night there's not seventy D you know, it alternates quite a lot. Yeah, it really is. <Laughter> Oh. Yeah, D well. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, that's fun. D Well, let's see. D Well, there's another band around here. Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players C and their concert schedule isn't as heavy, C but they have more in the summer, I think they have ten in the summer, D you know, one, one week after the other. I think they're D like Monday nights C and they don't have rehearsals during that time period. F Uh, D well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, D you know, again and again and again, C but some people are, yeah some of them are. D Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano. We're real close to Dallas. Yeah. Yeah, D well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, D you know. C And, C and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so C and, That's probably why we get so many people. F Um, D well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, D you know, we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events. F Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid. The city, uhhuh. Yeah, it's a similar thing. I can't remember what they call it, but the same type of thing. F Um, C but we do get an awful lot of music, D you know, we can borrow music from any of the area colleges C or, D you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing. C And we do an awful lot of, D you know, we don't charge for any of our performances, C but we get a lot of donations. Yeah <laughter>. Good morning <laughter>. Uhhuh. What do you play? Uhhuh. Really, that's too bad <laughter>. I play, F uh, the violin and play trumpet C and I run a municipal band C and I sometimes conduct. C So, I'm pretty busy too. I play in three different symphony orchestras. We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony. I play in the Altoona Symphony, was about fortyfive miles away C and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra. No, I'm, F uh, just retiring from Penn State University only I, I should, <laughter> should have been. I spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere. C But, F uh, I've been working at, F uh, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends F uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth. You have one that often. That's amazing because I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert. Wow. Uhhuh. Oh. You are busy. Where do you get all this music, E I mean, you, you must back up and play some of the music twice. <Throat_clearing>. F Oh, okay. So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. How many people in your band? Seventy. Holy mackerel, that's. Uhhuh. Boy, that is a huge organization, that's great. Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here. C But that fills a stage and keeps us busy, C but <throat_clearing> they were, half have been professionals from, F uh, a lot of them are from, F uh, faculty at Penn State here. C And so they want to play things that, F uh, push them to do. C So that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together. We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside. C And the last one we did was in a large, F uh, mall close here, we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall. C So that worked out very nicely. Yeah. Uhhuh. Wow, that. Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert? Okay. Uhhuh. C And where, where does this happen, Laurie, is this in Dallas? Uhhuh. D Well, I declare. That's amazing. Okay. Okay. Uhhuh. Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And you do have to buy your music. Who, who sponsors you basically, the city? Yeah, F uh, my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. D Well, I, I work the same way <laughter>. D Well, I'll be darned. It's amazing.
