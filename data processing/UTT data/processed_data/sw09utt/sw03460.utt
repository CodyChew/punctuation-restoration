Okay, F uh, what do you consider an invasion of privacy? Uhhuh. It's very easy. D Now, I've never, I've never had that happen to me either. What do you think about places, D like I was in Michael's the other night and charged something, C and they asked for my home phone even though, D you know, the charge had been approved. What do you think of that? Does it bother you to give it? You know that they, they now have a, F uh, I believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets. Security number, uhhuh. Oh. F Uh, uhhuh. Privacy, yes, yes. I can see, D you know, where that was. I, I don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, D you know, when I have to cash a check. I don't see any need for it when I'm charging something, C but I, neither am I a person that <laughter> has the guts to say, no, I'm not going to give it to you, either <laughter>. D You know, C and, F uh, Yes, yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right, right. I discovered with, F uh, charge cards, F uh, I feel like that I don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the, F uh, F uh, credit report bureau sells it, C but I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of. C And I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, D you know. From some list, D you know, that knows that I have a, say a charge account at, at Neiman's or something C because then I'll get catalogs that, D you know, are within that range that I would never order from ordinarily, C and, F uh, D you know, C and I get, I get tired of that. I, C because I look at all that junk mail, C and I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up <laughter> D you know, all their time to sort C and they're not even paying full postage. D You know, C and if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service. Right. Uhhuh. No, no. D Well, D you know, let's face it, computers can be gotten into very easily if you, if you really have the, the know with all, if you're, D you know, so inclined to, F uh, F oh, A what do I want to say, have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that. D You know, and have a basic knowledge, they're very easy to get into. To tap into a system. Uhhuh, D you know, and, F uh, which is scary, E I mean, D you know, our lives are on computers. C And, F uh, C and I don't know, I kind of, I resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something. F Uh, We are constantly, it seems like. I don't know why. D You know, either wanting to clean our carpet, sell us storm windows, F Uh, I was just now told that's what the topic was C and, F uh, I guess invasion of privacy, F uh, to me, for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards for example. C And, F uh, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, F uh, ran a series of, F uh, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers. And use it C and I was quite surprised at that. I guess I can consider myself fortunate that, F uh, it never happened to me. I don't know what I'd really do if it did. F Uh, No, not really because I'm listed in the phone book. If I was the type of individual that, F uh, had an unlisted number, I, I think I would be hesitant to give it. One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, F uh, they did a lot of things with s, your Social Security number. As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license. C And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number, C so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks. C And I was really, D you know, unhappy about that situation. I think that was an invasion of privacy. Right. One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, F uh, mail lists and things like that. D You know, F uh, recently we, F uh, I purchased some magazines, U S NEWS and FORBES magazine. C And every since that day, I have been inundated with, D you know, F uh, subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, F uh, this news letter, this investment letter, F uh, even to the point of people calling me at home. C And prior to me ordering these magazines, I never got those kind of calls. C And, Uhhuh. From some, some list, yeah. Uhhuh. Right. All their time. Sure. I think the general public would be, D you know, F uh, tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, F uh, let's say the criminal individuals to, to get access to people's records, F uh, their credit cards driver's licenses, checks, things like that. F Uh, I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it. Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure. Sure. Seems as though they are, yeah. Unfortunately. Fortunately, I haven't, F uh, haven't, F uh, been inundated with that situation yet.
