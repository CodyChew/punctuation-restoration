Seem to have the topic already on top of th, tip of your tongue there C so why don't you go ahead and start. Yes, sir. Okay. Right, exactly. <Laughter>. I sure do. I, F uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't even remember what it is. I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex, where we are not allowed to, work on our vehicle. We can't even wash our vehicle, C so. F Uh, C but the last thing I can remember doing wh, I had a sixtysix Mustang, C and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess. C And, F uh, D you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still, C and, F uh, I didn't tinker too much with the engine. It was, it was in pretty good shape, C but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior. C And, F uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, F uh, C but it was fun. It was taking the whole thing, D you know, the whole interior apart and, D you know, ordering new carpeting and, F uh, Right. C And, It, it was. I, my wife enjoyed, F uh, she, D you know, helped out a little. We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels. And painted, those and, No, I sold it. Yeah, it was fun though. It was fun. I, I really enjoyed it, C and I was surprised at, at, F uh, the availability of parts yet. D You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts. C But, F uh, you pay a premium C but you just don't get them. I, I didn't. I went ahead and got, D you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made, Canada. D You know, prefabs and all that stuff C but, D Well, D actually there was. C And, F uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate <throat_clearing> certain patterns, F uh, exactly. C And so D like the, the glove box was just a little, little wider, little harder to fit in, C and the carpeting, F uh, stretched a little too far. I had to cut some of the sides down. But just, just little things. D You know, one of the screws on, on the door regulat, F uh, window regulators you could get three of the, three of the four to lineup. The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did. D You know, thin, F Oh, it was C but, the end result is after you put your, your panels on, nobody sees that <laughter> you got one screw missing in your, your window regulator anyway C and, it, it runs. It works just the same, C so. Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem C but I, I honestly don't have the tools for the drum. I know you got, F uh, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, F uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch. F Uh, my dad has got all that C and, C and I, I helped him when I was growing up, C but I don't have that stuff now, because of the drum brakes I, D you know, don't have any choice but to take them in. Sure. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. I'll tell you what. The other, the nicest thing about them is, F uh, everything was standard. You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything. Boy, I tell you. Yeah. Isn't the, F uh, the subject auto repair, for tonight? Yeah. That's great. The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car C and, that's something I like to do and, F uh, something I, something I can do with now the sophisticated auto, cars we have today with all the computers and everything. It's, F uh, C and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car, C but I do like to get out and tinker with a car C and it's something I can do still. Do you enjoy working with your car? <Laughter>. F Oh, dear. F Oh, that's too bad. Oh. F Oh, yes. Oh. C And did you install all that yourself? D Well, that was, I bet that was a lot of fun. Uhhuh. Wow. Do you still have the car? D Well, that's too bad. A sixtyseven Chev, F uh, Mustang is about the, F uh, top, <noise> top year for the Mustang <laughter> car. Yes. F Huh. Yeah. D Well, D you know, that's, that's fine. I, I don't think that there would be, F uh, <breathing> D you know, a, a quality difference. I don't know. You wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you? Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, dear. Uhhuh. F Oh, dear. F Oh, I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it? <Laughter>. Right, right. Yeah, that's, that's true. D Well, D you know, that, that is something I really enjoy doing. F Um, working on our car too, the, F uh, I just changed my oil, oil tonight C but, F uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes C and, F uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car. C And, F uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on those kind of things. Yeah. Spoons and, Yes, you do <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. C And, D you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too C because, F um, I was helping my neighbor out C and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced C and I don't have, of course, the equipment to do that, C so he took it into a shop and had it resur, F uh, resurfaced and, and fixed that way. C But, yeah, it is true, F uh, D you know, I did have a sixtyfour Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it, because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff, that's in there now. <Laughter> F Oh, yeah. C And D you know,
