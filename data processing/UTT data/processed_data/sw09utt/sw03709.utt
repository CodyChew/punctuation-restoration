Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. They set that up for you. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, what kind of running do you do? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is is just aerobics C or, No, F uh, I mean the running. You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less? Uhhuh. Yeah. Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, F uh, out of breath. Oh. Oh. C But, E I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, D you know, if you tried to make six or something like that. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I don't run much any more. I did when I was in school. Right now <music> I just lift, F uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups C and, C and I, F uh, jump rope a little bit C and that is about it <noise>. C And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, F uh, they are about a third of my body weight. Yeah C and F uh, F uh, I play the trumpet C and the, F uh, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play. You have to do a whole lot of sit ups C and, F uh, <music> C and then, F uh, I hurt my neck, F uh, about three years ago. C So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, F uh, hurting yourself when you play high. You have to, you have to do it correctly, D you know, it is like an exercise in itself, C but <noise> a lot of people, F uh, strain themselves doing it. F Uh, I play at Church. Yeah. Uhhuh <music>. D Well, yeah, F uh, D well the weather is nice except for when it rains, D you know E I mean in Dallas. Yeah. I keep thinking about it, C but that doesn't mean it gets done. I, I mostly jump rope more. D You know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I do a toe lift and squats for that. C But you know it, it doesn't, F uh, doesn't, F uh, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have D like when you are running for a long time. They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something at, F uh, F uh, great length of time. C And it also builds too much mass if you just, D you know. C So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with. C And, F uh, then it doesn't bother me very much. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, that is, F uh, I have started doing more push ups C and, C and it has helped a lot C and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out. I don't try to push it so the end in one set. All right. F Uh, exercise F huh <music>? F Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings. I belong to Presidents. C And, F uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week C and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday C but, F uh, I do, I do a combination of, F uh, F uh, running and weight training <music>. No, I, F uh, D actually I just, F uh, joined on my own C and I have been thinking about getting with a, F uh, one of their counselors just so see what, F uh, they might have to offer as far as, F uh, alternatives. C But, I pretty much, F uh, worked on my own routine. They have got the track on the inside. C And, F uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays C and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles. C And then after that, I work out with weights. F Uh, I work out with free weights. F Oh, F uh, yeah. It is really the, F uh, aerobic work out part. F Uh, about seven minutes. F Uh, no I do <laughter>. Yeah, that is, that is a pretty good clip C and I am pretty winded by the time I get done. D So, F Oh, yeah. I, I, F uh, could probably go faster, C but then I would wear myself out <laughter>. C And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else. Yeah. How about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I see. C So this, F uh, do you just try and keep them, I guess, F uh, firm and, F uh, Yeah, F uh, that is true. Yeah. F Oh, I see. F Oh, I see. F Uh, D so you are in, F uh, in part of a band? F Oh, I see, I see <noise>. I use to play an instrument when I was in high school, C but it wasn't the trumpet <laughter>. C So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something. I think, D So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer? Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, F uh, when I was, F uh, D well a while back I was more into basketball C and, F uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves. C And, F uh, C but, it has been a while since I have done that. Right. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I, F uh, that is true. I have noticed that, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. F Huh. That is interesting though. F Uh, I have been thinking of changing, F uh, I have done the same routine for almost two years now C and I am thinking of, F uh, changing it up. F Uh, that is why, D well, D you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, F uh, get out of the routine. C Because I have heard that, D you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing. C So, I am looking at changing things a little bit. Uhhuh. Yeah.
