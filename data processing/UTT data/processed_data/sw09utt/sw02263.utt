Okay <laughter>. They suggested that we, F uh, discuss what we think of when we say camping. F Oh, I can camp just about, most anyway <laughter>. Camping or, F uh, motor home is nice, F uh, travel trailer, pop up, F Oh, really? Oh. You really rough it then. Uhhuh. Do you do that very often? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area. Yeah. That would be really great. Pardon? Uhhuh. That sounds like it'd be fun. Did you go alone or with a group or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's great. Long as it's not raining. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Really, F oh, that would be, Huhuh. D Well, I'm in Pennsylvania. Yes <laughter>. Are you in Texas, now? Oh. Okay. Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas, C but, F uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania. Uhhuh. D Well you kind of know what it's like, then. Yeah. C But, we've, F uh, we've done, F uh, many types of camping. We've, we've done tent camping, C and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, <laughter> if you don't want to rough it too much. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on. We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, F uh, Delaware along the o, ocean most every year. C And that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks C and, F uh, we really enjoyed that. Huh? F Oh, maybe my, dropping my phone. Is that better? <Laughter> Oh. C But, Yeah. D Well, we used to, we don't as much anymore, C but, F uh, we used to. We kind of slowed down a little bit. C But, F uh, I think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining. If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad. Uhhuh. I don't think I would like that. What kind? Oh. Those aren't too pleasant. Yeah. We have some of them around here. You probably have more there, though, I would imagine. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C But you still backpacked and camped out. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing. Yeah. Yeah, I would think, I would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, is your brother younger than you C or, Uhhuh, uhhuh, D well, that's great, that'd be a lot of fun. You have a lot good experiences from that. Yeah. Did you really? What, black ones? Yeah. That would be exciting. <Laughter>. Yeah, they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually. They're on the increase in this area. Uhhuh. The black bear. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, the population's been really up. They've, F uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, F uh, increasing so much. Uhhuh. Yeah. C But, F uh, we, we really like camping. I, I must say that, F uh, we ha, we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping C and, F uh. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, C so, it's a lot of work, too it's, F uh, get, D you know, getting ready and taking care of everything. C But it's, F um, it's really refreshing. C So, I think so <laughter>. D Well, it was really good hearing from you C and I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it. Okay. Thanks a lot, C and you have a good day. Byebye. Okay. Yeah. What do you, where do you like to camp? How do you like to camp? I used to, F uh, live in the Ozarks and, F uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods. Yeah. I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here. C But I used to do it quite a bit. Yeah, yeah it was real hilly. Take a twentytwo C and go out. Take a twentytwo C and find a creek. I used to go with my brother. We just lived up there. Yeah, it gets kind of, I, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain. C But I don't know much about camping in Texas. You live in Pennsylvania? <Laughter>. I didn't know they did this. Yeah. Yeah. I'm down here at T I. I used to be in Ohio, it's some pretty country up there. D So, Yeah. You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds D you know, that have the water piped out just set it up C and get out of, get out of the city for awhile. Tell you what, I'm losing you. I said I'm losing you, you're getting fad, you're fading out. Yeah. D So what, you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp? Yeah. I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks, That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping. F Uh, copperheads mostly, No, they're. Yeah. One year they were, they were just everywhere. I don't know what it was, we had a real rainy spring C and then it was all year, there was just copperheads everywhere. Yeah. D Well I lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow C and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time. If it rained we were stuck back in there. Had a four wheel drive. You just get used to it. Yeah. Yeah. This cave that we used to go in was little, it was small it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out. Yeah. He's about a year and a half younger. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Saw a few bears things like that. Yeah. Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary C but, F uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too. C But, F uh, F Oh, really? I don't know if, they don't have them up there do they? Yeah. F Oh, do they? Yeah, they, down here they, they stopped for awhile C or they really made it hard to hunt them. I don't know what it's like now, I haven't been back up there in awhile. D Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too. D So, Yeah. D Well, I think we're about to run out of our time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure, I will. You, too. Bye.
