Do you use credit cards a good bit? F Uh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. Absolutely. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, D actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards. I don't use them very often. F Um, F oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, <breathing> D you know, I have, <breathing> keep those active. I have a half a dozen department store credit cards, C and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that, just enough to keep them active. My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover. C And for the most part, I had used those for D like, F uh, charging airline tickets, <lipsmack> where I can pay for those, D you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone, C or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine. F Uh, C and it saves a lot time. C And that's what I was using it for. However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative, you must have the money to do this with, C and you do not have any other options C so I charged all three of those cards up, C and right now I am paying and praying. C But, F uh, Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. D Well, I never did, Right. I never did use it for an advance. Most of my charges were, F uh, medications. Didn't have cash for the medications <breathing> C or it was, F uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA C And, F uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, F uh, F uh, different labs will use those charge accounts for, Uhhuh <<faint>>. D Well, I have not, like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical. I don't generally charge. I say D well, I need a checkup in six months, C and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it. I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway, C and I can handle, D you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks. Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy. It is easy, C and it's very difficult to get out. I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges. I say wow, I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off. Big deal, I'm saving two percent. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah, C and it's not just paying back what you've charged, it's paying that and half again. F Uh, you send in, F uh, F uh, fifty dollars, you're going to pay twenty, twentyfive in interest charges. You only get half of that paid for the principal, C so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts. D Now, as the monthly payment, F uh, E I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments. F Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that. Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves. Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, right, right. Uhhuh, <<faint>> uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, you C either need a big chunk of money C or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment. D Now, those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem C because you're living on the other guy's money for a while. C But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money <laughter>. C And it just irks me. I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this, C and I've got three cards. I've lost a whole day of my life to interest. Yeah, yeah. C And that just blows my mind. I, my house is paid for, my car is paid for, I've got some home improvements, C but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's right. I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Uh, I went to a seminar, they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items. You only use credit cards for investments. I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to in, D you know, <laughter> if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card. That doesn't make a bit of sense to me. I thought God dang, where is his pencil? That's right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it. I do, C and I wish I didn't <laughter>. Before I got married, F uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, D you know the cash with me all the time, C but I just never wanted to get into the hangup of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head. In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard, C and the only reason I got it was, D you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without D like a MasterCard or VISA C And so that's why I went ahead and got one. It was a mistake <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> I know how that goes C and that's exactly what we've, E I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money we had no way around it C and the only way to do it is go get, D you know, an advance on a card C and so D like you were paying for it, C but it's one of those I'm glad it was there. F Oh, I see. Oh. <Lipsmack>. What, Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't? I've found some doctors that say, D you know, I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards, C and so many of them don't anymore. D So, Yeah. Right. Right. F Oh, it is <<whispering>>. I know. Right. C But, D you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A C and you got all your interest, D you know towards your tax deductions, C and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it. C And C but it, C but it is easy to get into a credit card problem, C and I, I think about young people that think, D you know, there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat, I have my first credit card C and, C and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments. D You know. That's right. That's right. That's right. Right. Right. Right. No, C and that's frightening to me. That's right. That's frightening, too. F Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself I work for T I C but he doesn't C and, F uh, <lipsmack> we're, F uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers cr, crossed. I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened D you know, C but he's got some, D you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases, C and after ten years he's got two of them C and they should pay through next month, C and, C and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off D like both of our MasterCards, D you know. And, D you know, just in one lump, C because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money C or it's like you say, you pay forever. C And so I'm really looking forward to that. That's right. Right. Sure, yeah. I agree. That's right <laughter>. I know C and, I know. You're like what am I working for today <laughter>. It's incredible. Boy, I wish I could say that my house and, D well, my car is paid for now. It was wrecked three weeks ago, C but, C but you see again the credit cards came in handy. I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back. C And, F uh, Yeah. Because you know that's coming back to pay it off. Right. It's, Sure. That's right. That's right. D Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables, don't, D you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card D you know, C and, C and so that, that is the smart half. C But, F uh, C and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot, C but it was no biggie D you know, because we could pay it off, while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off, C so we cut that out real quick <laughter>. C And, F uh, C but I, I do like having them there. There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use C but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or common sense not, not to get yourself in trouble. Uhhuh.
