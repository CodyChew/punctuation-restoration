D So, F uh, describe your family budget. D Well, yeah, C and to some extent, utilities, I imagine. They have that to some extent here, C but it's not quite as good. And, F uh, transportation expenses, I guess you own a car. C And you know how much you're going to drive every week? F Huh. Yeah, I understand that. We, we have a real similar situation. Ours, F uh, have quintupled, at least. C So there is a real family budget. Yeah. If you're lucky. Exempt or nonexempt. Wow, must be nice. Part of the high price spread. F Uh, no, D well, we don't, we do, C but we don't have a family budget. We have the fixed things we have to pay. C And we have the things that are extras. C But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist. And, D well, D you know, the auto budget, car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry. And insurance, is insurance bad there? D Well, we've got one eightynine. Wow. That's not bad, four hundred and something a year. That's, that's, That's cheaper than we pay. D Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault. Do you have that there? D Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that <<pause>> everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays. <Laughter>. You're kidding. God. Not at all. They don't even try to keep up with it. God. D So you lived in Texas for a while. F Huh. Are, where you from originally. F Huh, C so you just basically went home when you had a chance. That's nice. God, that's great. F Uh, I'm a native Texan. West Texan. There is a difference. Yeah. D Well, I'm a West Texan. Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle. A different world from down there. D So, F uh, Colorado's been fun. C But they have a real problem. Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile. C And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar. C Or so it seems. I may just be paranoid, C but that state income tax is just eating me alive. Yeah, yeah. Property taxes and, Yeah, D well, Colorado, ins, you know they have the state income tax, C but then they also have property taxes, C and they also have sales taxes, C and they just get you every direction they can. C And I just don't know, sir, C but it seems like they trying to get you every which way. F Oh yeah? I've heard of the book. Legally? Legally, cut money on your taxes. F Huh. C And that includes everyone at T I. D Well, even, the, D you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet. C But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter. D You know, survival is a funny state. Yeah. Did, D well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now. I was a W F for several years, C and it just n, never seems to improve. It, C and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twentyeight or above. It's really a shame. Oh. D Well, I've, F uh, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one, C and, F uh, just recently, F uh, we, we set up a budget, C and, C and we're trying to stick to it. We just bought a new house. C So we've got everything, D you know, pretty much we know what our, F uh, our fixed expenses are per month, C and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range, C and then, F uh, then there's the ones that you never know anything about, C and that's, that's the food budget. Yeah, D well, the utilities are pretty much, you can pretty much figure what they're going to be, C and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you. Uhhuh. Yes sir. D Well, I used to, F um, I used to know, F uh, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, F uh, nine tenths of a mile from work. C So, C so, it was, D you know, two miles a day <laughter> to and from work. C So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot. C But now I've just bought a new house, C and I'm a half hour, C and so my transportation costs have gone up by, F uh, five times <laughter>. Yeah, pretty much, F um. The problem is there never seems to be enough money. I have three children, C and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need, C and, F uh, of course, nothing ever goes down, E I mean, F uh, I remember, I have five children total. I have three left in the house. C And I can remember years ago, when school would start, C and I'd go buy all five kids, D you know, shoes, C and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirtyfive dollars. Nowadays, thirtyfive dollars buys about one pair of shoes yeah, C so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, F uh, I guess about the last ten years. I'm exempt. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Um, I've got, F uh, two older cars. There both, one's a seventyseven C and one's a seventyeight. C And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year. C But when I moved to the new town I live in, C because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, F uh, less, D you know, less highways C and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned, C so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year. It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars. Yeah, I was down in Texas for two years, C and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance. F Um, Yeah. they have no fault in Maryland also. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. F Uh, here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up. Nope. They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company. D Well, if you, I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland, C but, F uh, especially, the center part of Maryland where I NinetyFive runs through it is really heavily populated. There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic. No. Not a bit. Yes sir. I spent, F uh, couple of years down there. Moved down there in eightyseven C and moved out in eightynine. F Uh, right here in Maryland. Yeah, my family, F uh, didn't like Texas, C and I had a chance to, F uh, transfer up. T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in. C So I got an opportunity to transfer back, C and I took it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, believe me, I know there is. I lived in Plano, C and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano C but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas. Everybody else was an import. Uhhuh. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah, they have a state income tax in Maryland. C But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax, C but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and, school taxes and property taxes, F Oh my God, ate you alive. Yeah. Yeah, it sure does. F Um, there's, F uh, some good books that I've read, F um, that you might be interested in. F Uh Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V C and he's got seminars you can go to, C and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks. C But he's got a couple of books out. One of them is called, F uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK. Yes, it's a very good book. It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save. Yes, yes, legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance, C and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, F uh, D you know, be wealthier. F Uh, he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. F Um, FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. F Uh, the man, F uh, has a lot of good ideas, some of them I already knew about, some of them I had already practiced. C But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, F uh, <Laughter> Yes, I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninetyone. Yes. Yet. <Laughter>. Yeah, I know what you mean. I, F uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor, C and I had four non exempts, F um, under me. C And, F uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them. I just couldn't believe it. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll. C And, F uh, the, D you know, I thought I was making a good wage,
