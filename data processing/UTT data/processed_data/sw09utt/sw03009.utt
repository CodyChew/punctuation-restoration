<Beep> Okay. No, I don't, C but I have nine younger brothers and sisters. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I would assume it's, D you know, if you were looking for a daycare center or something like that. C Or probably even babysitters would be the same thing. Yes, I would think someone older C and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Yes, that's true also. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F um, I did a lot of babysitting when I was younger. I'm twentytwo now C and I did most of my babysitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen. C But, F um, the only thing people ever asked me, D well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids, C but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not. The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay. D You know, C and, F um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, D you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has babysit for before. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. D Well, D see when, F um, I first got my mai, my first babysitting job was pretty strange. F Um, this lady saw us at church C and she was a you, D you know, she was a younger lady. She didn't really know my mom. She knew my mom by name C and that was it. C And, F um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family C so she just asked my mom if I could babysit. D You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, D you know, I thought that was pretty strange. D You know, C and she had two children. One was still in diapers when I started babysitting. C So, F um, she pretty much, D you know, just assumed that I would know, D you know, how to handle them. D So, I wa, D you know, I enjoy kids C and I get along with them very well C so there's no problem. C But, F uh, with today's world and the kids today, F uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, D you know, that I didn't know like that to babysit. Uhhuh, that's true. Uhhuh. F Oh, I would be too <laughter>. F Oh, my. Huhuh. Uhhuh, yes. Uhhuh. F Oh, I know. F Um, D well, I real, I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, How did you stumble upon the daycare center? Did you just look it up in a phone book C or what was it? Uhhuh. Yeah, there is, I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth. Uhhuh. Yes, exactly. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Then again, did, F um, money come into play with it at all? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. D Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children. You don't? My goodness. <Laughter> C So. D Well, I have two daughters C and, F um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while, C and they're almost where I can start saying they're, D you know, young adults, C so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore. F Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect. D Well, if I were look, Exactly. Exactly. F Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children. Uhhuh. C And I think that varies. I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child. F Um, D you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, D you know, really, really qualified per se. F Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency. C So, F Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I, my experience, I babysat a lot also at, when I grew up C and, F um, coming from, D you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times babysitters, I know I did this with my children, it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already. C And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions. C Becaus, C because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself C so they, they thought, okay, she knows how to, how to treat children. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Wow. F Oh, I agree with you, C but there again she, D you know, she knew, knew of your family, C and she, C and she met in a safe setting, such as church. C So she was going on those two instincts. Just the same I know myself, I never, C and I was very very protective on who babysat my children. C And, C and in i, it really shocked me C because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell. She had just moved in the neighborhood. She had her daughter with her, C and the daughter was, F oh, about a second grader. C And she was actively looking for people who would babysit her child. C And I thought, D well she doesn't know me or my children from anything. C And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because I didn't know her <Laughter> then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house. C So, E I mean people are so different. D Well, I did, I did have, F um, my, my child, F uh, in a day care for just a short time a, when my oldest was about two and a half C and I worked just a parttime job C and, F uh, in, in those situations, F um, what I did is I'd, I went in C and, D you know, I made a few phone calls, I went in and visited. I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child. F Um, that was a concern with me. F Um, D you know, c, you, you learn a lot by going in there C and they e, they explain to you, D you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are, C and, F um, that's, D you know, that's as much as I know. You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers D you know, that have done this over and over again. C But I, go ahead. F Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing. I think most people do that. I think you start out with the criteria of, D you know, do I know of anything C or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care C and, Right. Right. C And then, D you know, E I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it. D You know, E I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. Yo, even if that's the best one in the whole wide world <laughter>. C So there, there are just so many considerations. F Oh, money is always a factor in my life, <Laughter> definitely. I've never, D you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. F Um, even in something as important as day care. I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently D you know. F Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued, C but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at. F Um, C and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a fulltime basis. C So, C and, C and then when you get, D you know, when you get into the fulltime basis day care,
