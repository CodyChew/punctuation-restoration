Where are you, Bob? F Oh, okay. I am in Waco. Yeah. Right down the street. F Oh, credit cards. My favorite subject <laughter>. F Oh, do I. Yeah, mostly over Christmas. F Uh, I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle. Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off C and so then you have no money, <Laughter> C so you use a credit card. Yeah. F Uh, I probably have one of every credit card there is. Do you use them a lot? Uhhuh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, that is a good idea. Is that that through a VISA? Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh. Yeah. That is my problem. I don't try and pay them off. I pay, D like the minimum. I know <laughter>. C So I have got myself, Exactly. I have got, that is why I have got myself with all this trouble now. C But, I pay most of them on time and everything. It is just the, I always have them. C So, it is kind of strange. F Oh, yeah. Exactly like the government <laughter>. In, In debt. Yeah. Have they put the cap on the interest rates? I didn't know if they actually did that or not. I know they were considering it. Uhhuh. Yeah. Funny how that works, isn't it <laughter>? I would be interested to find out how many people, E or how much, F uh, people use credit this year. Say in nineteen ninetytwo as opposed to nineteen ninetyone, even nineteen ninety. I think, I think it would be amazing how much, how many more people use it. Because of the economy. Yeah. Exactly. I would be very, I would like to see some numbers on that. I think that would be interesting. Yeah, I have a credit union. Yeah, they do. Uhhuh. Yes, I do <laughter>. <Laughter> Yes, I do a matter of fact. F Uh, I work for Channel six. It's it's an N B C affiliate down here. F Oh really. F Oh, okay. Where do you work? What is your, F Oh, okay. F Oh, okay <<faint>>. C So you probably work with, F uh, F uh, what is the boy from here? <<Very faint>>. You ever work with Davis? Davis Iron Work, yeah. F Oh, okay. And, F uh, what else. D Well, I live actually in Hewett. Yeah, right outside. C So, that is where Davis Iron Works is. F Uh. I don't think I have seen that one. I am sure I pass by it or something, C but I am not sure. F Huh. Prime Air. F Oh, okay. Okay. Have you ever been to Marlin? I think it is Marlin or Mart. They have, F uh, F uh, a place, I guess that would be similar to Prime Air. It is called H G H or something like K G H or, I can't think of it. I can't think of the name. C But, F Oh yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Oh, I don't like that drive. I make that drive sometimes we have stories out there C but, F uh, F Huh. F Oh, really <laughter>. I know. F Oh, goodness. They, they are bad at Hewett too. On eightyfour. They are real bad. That is where I got my last ticket. C So, of course, I couldn't pay that on a credit card. I am in Plano. Where are you? Is that right? F Oh, okay. <Laughter>. You mean you use credit cards? I bet you used them all up over Christmas. C And then your are in debt. <Laughter>. I understand that. <Laughter>. D Well, F uh, it kind of comes and goes, F uh, I use F uh, Citibank, the, F uh, Advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend. Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way. C So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything. That is what I, Yeah. Yeah. C But, F uh, I got all sorts of credit cards for my business that I use C but, F uh, If I can get away with paying them off every month, it is alright. If I don't then it gets expensive <laughter>. D Well you shouldn't do that. You never, you never get out of the hole that way. Kind of like the federal government right? <Laughter>. Can't never get out of debt. C And every time you try to get out of debt, the economy goes to pot because people are spending money, right. <Laughter>. No. Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent. The rest of the, F uh, and me, we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent. <Laughter>. The, thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit. D Well, I think so C because the, That's right. You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at. Do you, do you have any, F uh, credit union where you work or anything like that? Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card? You have got that one. <Laughter>. Who, who do you work for? Oh. I do a lot of work down in Waco, a lot of, I call on a lot of my business is down there. I sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling. Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there. F Uh Gene He, Davis Iron? Yeah, matter of fact I just saw them last week. Are you in that part, are you in the south part of town now? F Oh, yeah. Okay. You know Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there. Bobby Parker and, F uh, There is a place in Hewett, called, it is a new company called Prime Air. That is in Hewett. Just around the corner from Davis Iron Works. They make, F uh, humidifiers and F uh, filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals, homes, something like that. F Uh, yeah. F Oh, really. F Huh. F Huh. I will have to stop in there. I went, I have gone through there, F uh, my oldest son goes to A and M. He is working on his Master's. The Navy sent him there for his Master's. Mostly in engineering. C So, once and a while we go up six there rather than take fortyfive. That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart <laughter>. There is always a state trooper down there. You have got to drive careful. Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour. Uhhuh. <Laughter>.
