Great. F Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program. I'm mainly do a lot of walking. I have a son that's a little bit overweight C and, F um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around. C So my wife and I kind of take turns. At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program. C But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down. All this space that normally would be dedicated <laughter> towards the, exercise area, is covered in boxes. D Well, I had, F uh, a little routine that I did for warm ups. C And then I did some very mild, D say, light weight lifting. Nothing, I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles, just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age <laughter>. Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah. That's a plus. F Oh, I have a total of five children. I have three left living at home. C And they do take up a big part of my, F uh, my evening and weekend. C And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too. It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up. Yes, when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children. <Laughter>. Yeah. You have to, what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself. C And you can use what ever rationale you want, C but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live. C And, F uh, D you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, D well, then I'll around a lot longer, C And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, D well, D you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it. If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine. Huhuh. Yeah. F Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years C and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water. Yeah. F Um, the research that I've done C and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eightythree. C And, it's amazing, that, F uh, D you know, prior to D like nineteentwenty there were very few heart attacks. There were none prior to nineteenhundred. D Well, in nineteenthree they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteenthirteen most of the major cities, C and after that we, we started having the hearts attacks C and, F uh, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE. You can usually find it in a health food store. I know they had it in health food stores in Plano, I used live in Plano. F Uh, Dr. Price, yeah. C And it's amazing, he makes the, D you know, it's a very small book C and the guys very opinionated, F um, C but he makes a very good case against chlorine. There were no heart attacks before we started using it C and he points out that people in, F uh, England C and, F uh, C or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now, C and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks. Yeah. He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours. And, F uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the, clogging of the arteries. C And, F uh, D you know, he's, there's been a lot of reports since then. This whole thing about, first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol, C and now they're saying what's cholesterol, D well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol. D You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book C and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eightysix, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eightyseven. C And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis. C And, E P A never published that report. CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is, there is a lot of good information out there, F uh, about health. C And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true. E I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you, F uh, C but to believe some of the things, D you know, C and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet, C but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe. Huhuh. Yeah. I actually eat pretty much anything that I want. C And I've had my cholesterol checked and, F uh, a few times C and I've never been above, D like, D you know, onehundred and fifty, never. C And, F uh, F uh, E I mean, I, F Um, D Well, what they tell me, C but, E I mean, D you know, everything is D like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing <laughter>. D You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued. C But, F uh, we've, I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Yeah C and we've had a few of the health fairs up here C and, F um, D you know, I've always come out aces. D You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat, C but I do eat, D you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber, low in fat and all that kind of stuff. C But, I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm not worried about it. <<Tape fades.>> Okay. Huhuh. Yeah. F Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly? Huhuh. Huhuh. Yeah <laughter>. F Um, right now, F um, I try when it's nice out, it's been raining a lot this spring, C but I try to, F uh, I have a bicycle C and I like to cycle a lot. C And, F uh, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas, I don't know, if it's up north, C but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally C and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun. F Um, C so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that. C And, F um, T I, where I work has, F uh, a fitness center C so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill, C and, F um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on. C So I try to, I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis. I used to, F uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule, C so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now, C but it's a big commitment. We don't have any kids yet C so, that's a lot of, part of it. Huhuh. Yeah. Yeah. Huhuh <laughter>. That's why, they, F uh, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, D like stay in fit, overall fitness, D you know, no smoking and all that. C But it's hard to find, F uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, D you know, because D like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes C and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain. C But it's really hard to find something that works, and, D you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it D like three days a week or whatever. I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever. Yeah. Huhuh. Right. <Laughter> Huhuh. Yeah. F Um, I've been learning a lot lately about, F um, I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper, I don't know if you're familiar with him he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health D really. He's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing. F Um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, C and what was the other one, I think was, D yeah, obesity. If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, D you know, cause those are risk factors, D so D anyway, it's kind of a tip. Really <laughter>. Huhuh. Huhuh. . Huhuh. Dr. Price? Huhuh. That's really interesting. Huhuh. Yeah. Huhuh. C And what's the name of this book again? I'll have to remember that. That will be very interesting. My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon C so, he's really interested in the heart. C And he's, in fact, he's a, D well, heart, too, he's, F uh, he's done a lot of research on D like how your heart reacts to exercise <laughter>. Sorry, he made me laugh. F Um, D so D anyway, Yeah. Huhuh. If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol. That's a real good, F um, he talks about that. Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that. Huhuh. Huhuh. You have a good ratio of good to bad. Cholesterol. Yeah. F Oh, really. That's good. Yeah.
