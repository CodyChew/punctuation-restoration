<TV> Okay. What would you rather have? C Or you want salary too plus what? What's most important to you? <Throat_clearing>. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I'll tell you. I think that is the most important thing <laughter>. I've, F uh, I'm not working right at the moment C but the company that I did work for <throat_clearing> E excuse me <cough> <<in background>> I had health benefits. D You know, dental, vision, all that, pension plan, F uh, now I don't have that, although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which, thank God, I had. C But, F uh, D man, I think those medical benefits are the most important. F Uh, Right. F Uh, I should knock on wood. I haven't, D you know, had any serious health problems or anything. I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I <swallowing> left work C and it was only for a cold, D you know, C and they can't really do anything for you anyhow, C so you might as well not even go <laughter> <sniffing>. Yeah, right <laughter>. F Oh, you've got a cold. Go home and take, F uh, liquids and, F uh, rest. <Laughter> C But, F uh, that is definitely, the most important. F Uh, pension, I guess, is next. F Uh, thank God that I had one. I don't know what happened to the salary employees when, F uh, the company went bankrupt <<mispronounced>> C but I was union, C so mine was being put into a, like a trust fund, D you know. C So, C but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs C or, Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there, D you know. C So where, what company do you work for? F Um, uhhuh. No. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, I, I worked for a trucking company P I E, nation wide. You probably heard of that <laughter>. F Oh, does she really? F Oh, how about that. D Well, you did. D Well Ryder and P I E went together D you know, C and then, then that ended it <swallowing>. It really did. It's, it started, I think, a little bit before that C but that, when P I E and, and Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, D you know. Right. Right. Yes, it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits. We could do that for eighteen months. C But three hundred and fifty dollars a month. D God, that's terrible. D You know. C So, C but D anyhow, F uh, C and jobs aren't that hard to find, to get another one that does pay your benefits, D you know. C And a lot of them that, if you do get a job, they don't pay benefits. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Huh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, right <cough> <<in background>>. C But D you know what's happening is the, disability plan, D you know, so many people are lying about their things. D God, there's been big articles in the paper about that. F Uh, D you know, they claim a back injury C and then someone goes out and spies on them C and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else, D you know. C So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen. C But, F uh <TV>, D Well, as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, F uh, health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern. I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision as well as good longterm and shortterm disability plans, F uh, goes a long way toward satisfying my needs. Right. You, you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical C and, F uh, you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your, your compensation package. Yeah, they look at you, D say, D well you're still breathing, so, F uh, Yeah. <Noise>. Right. I suspect that it just disappeared. Right. F Uh, I work for a little startup company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark. F Uh, Have you heard of them? They, we do, F uh, distributive system software for Unix based workstations C So. F Ah, yes, yes. In fact, my mom drives trucks C so, Yes. C So, yeah, I see, F uh, after the merger, F uh, you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road. C So, did, did Ryder get out of the business? Is that what happened or? Right. F Huh. So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing. Yeah, C and the, the problem with that is, D you know, when you leave a job, you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time. C But when, when the company goes bankrupt, E I mean, the, they're just cut off completely C and you're responsible for your own. C And, C and that's exceedingly expensive. Right. It's definitely excessive. True. Yeah, they're starting to, to cut back. Especially startups. I know here at Trans Ark, we get, F uh, we get health care C and that's it. E I mean, there's no dental or vision. C And the, the shortterm disability policy is, is a ninety day policy C and there is no longterm disability policy. C So, D you know, at least in the case of this particular company, they tend to scrimp a little bit there. C And, D you know, of course, they can use the excuse D well, we're startup. Right. D Well that certainly doesn't help matters any. E I mean, you, you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get D you, you know, these additional benefits,
