D Well, I, F uh, before I was married, I used to play a lot of sports. C And, F uh, C but when I got married <laughter> and had children and everything, it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations C so I haven't done a lot of, F uh, exercise on purpose. What about you? F Oh, really? Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh no, that can be awful. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's good. Uhhuh. Do you work out on, D like, is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I bet. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um. <Laughter>. Doesn't sound like low impact. D Well. D Well that's good. C So are you moti, D Well, I, D like, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise, C but I like to, F uh, play tennis and play racquetball I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort, C and so that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, F uh, the shape that I was satisfied with at least. C And, F uh, then I have given that up, C but, F uh, I would really like to start that again, because I am now, D you know, not in a position that I like myself. I don't feel good C and I get, D you know, when you get out of shape and you don't, if, you're easily tired C and so that has made me, C but I, I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out, I just, if something like, F uh, E I mean I have so many chores and so many obligations every day for, to add another obligation would make me feel stressed. C And I wouldn't enjoy it. C But if I have something, some team sport or some activity, then it's kind of like having fun, playing C and then you, then you get some of the, F uh, good exercise and some of the desired results, C but you, you're doing it for fun. C But I really admire people who can go and work out C and, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's nice. Uhhuh. Yes. It is kind, It is family, C and it's fun. It's a fun thing C and kids enjoy that and <breathing> and all. C And also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation, D you know, like saunas, or <laughter> D you know, F uh, hot Jacuzzis or whatever, they have that kind of is, kind of makes it fun and stuff, D you know, you can relax that way, afterwards and things. D Well, I guess it's getting late. C And I should take off, C but, F uh, I appreciate that, that helped me, helped motivate me <laughter>. Think someone can do it. Maybe I should start thinking about it again. Yeah, I bought one, I went to the, I bought the low impact first. I thought, I shouldn't out of the blue just jump in. C So, C but I haven't done it. C But I'm going to try it. D Well you have a good night. We'll see you. Byebye. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, it's funny, this week, yesterday I started exercising seriously. This weekend I cleaned out my closets C and, F uh, <lipsmack> a couple years ago I, too, got married. I haven't have any children yet, C but <breathing> this weekend I cleaned out some closets C and I found a bathing suit that I had bought. <Laughter> Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me. C So yesterday I went to, F uh, a spa. I belong to a private spa and went in and, and got with a trainer C and, F uh, he checked body fat content C and we set up a program for me to work on, C and I went back tonight also. C So I've been two nights in a row C and I, I'm going to take it pretty seriously. I'm going to start going every night just, D you know, even if I, I, D like tonight I only went for thirty minutes, C but I at least did something. Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few, D like, three different types of, F uh, F uh, weight lifting for my legs and, and my hips C and then I did a hour of aerobics. C And that was really tough <laughter>. C And I was sore this morning when I got up, C but then tonight I got into a, a, it's sort of like an aerobics class C but it's only thirty minutes C and it's for your abdominals your thighs, and your butt. C So, C and that was, thirty minutes was definitely plenty. D So, No, it was a lot of sweat C but, I've been trying to eat correctly also. D So, Have you started exercising at home C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I don't, D you know, a lot of people, I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it C and she walks around, talks to people C and <breathing>, C and, I don't really get into that. Naturally I'm married C so my husband goes a lot C and we'll go and, and just do what we want to do and then leave. C But, yeah, C and swimming is a, is a part that I, I'd like to get into as far as my <breathing>, D you know, just aerobic activity they say that swimming is real good, C so I'd like to try that as well. C And that's probably something that, that you could do, D you know family, included. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah. I agree <breathing>. Yeah. <Laughter> Okay. Yeah. D Well, try it C or, C or maybe just exercise at home. I bought a tape, C and I'm going to try doing that. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's me. Uhhuh. Thanks a lot. Byebye.
