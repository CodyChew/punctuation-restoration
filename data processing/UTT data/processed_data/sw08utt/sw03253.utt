Hi. I'm wondering what, what camping means to you. F Oh, very good. That's sort of the same thing that, that I do. I don't think of, F um, trailers and campers and all this stuff. F Um, do you do much camping? F Oh, you've never been camping. F Oh, gee. D Well, F um, yes and no, C and, the, F uh, I haven't done much recently, C but, F um, up until, D gee, maybe five or six years ago, I did a lot of it <throat_clearing> C and, you know I've, Say? No, F um, I used to live abroad, C and so, I, I camped a lot in, F um, the Middle East C and I was able to camp right in ruins, which was always very exciting <Laughter> and, a bit exotic <laughter>, for those who love bugs, C but, <laughter>, F um, C and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up, F um, to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and, and do camping there. C And you're not going? F Oh, that's too bad, F Oh, gee. I guess it makes a difference. I grew up camping, being in Girl Scouts and things like that, C so. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, that's too bad. I think the, D you know, there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like, C but maybe not the, D yo, you know the Canada men's trip, but some other, D you know, a nice tent on the, the shore of a lake, C and, Right, the, the, the no telephone, the, D gee whiz, you go to bed when it gets dark, C and you get up when it gets light <laughter>. Yeah, C and, F um, I guess just, just the change, from the rat race. No, it's, F uh, it's pretty isolated, F um, C and to me, I like that, I guess, too, although there are people, E I mean, D you know, it's really hard to get away <Throat_clearing> C and I guess when, when we did sites in, in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to make it safe C but, E I mean, we'd go in different parts of the ruins, and, and things like that. C But we didn't even have tents there, <laughter> we just sort of put out the sleeping roll <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Right. <Laughter> Right. D Actually I just joined, F um, the Appalachian Trail Walking Club, or whatever they call it, what, F uh C and I'm very eager to, to start, F uh, I love to walk C and, F um, I'm going to start with day trips, though, because I don't know the territory and all, C and I'm not sure, my son is not eager to go C and, <Laughter> D you know, I think that, that that might be a little eerie at first, going alone. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. F Oh, C but, D you know, I'm going to try <laughter>. D Well, gee whiz, I hope you get into camping some day, just slowly. F Oh, yeah. Right, I think that, D you know, I guess one time recently we went up to Maine, and had planned to camp, C and D you know, the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field, C and I said, D Gee whiz, for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a, a motel which we did, C and, so that, D you know, if the setting was right and that, it's, it's great, C but if it's, Hi. When I think of camping I think of, of bugs <laughter>, and sleeping bags and, and tents, F uh, D like along the Appalachian Trail. No. I have never been camping <laughter>. No. Do you do much? Really, Where you live now, C or, Did you camp up in Maryland, C or, F Oh, okay. F Oh, I bet. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. D Well, my cou, F uh, husband and, and his uncle especially, F uh, grew up camping together, C and, F uh, they, they just love it, C and they're planning a trip, F uh, into Canada this, I guess in about a year, C and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there, No, this is, this is a, a man's trip <laughter>. C So they're really looking forward to that D so. C And D see I was, I was never exposed to it D so, I, I feel like I'm a little bit too, F uh, much of a city, city mouse to try doing it <laughter>. What's the best part about it to, to you, the, the quiet, the getting away? <Laughter>. Wow. <Cough>. D Now, do you usually, D like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around, C or is it pretty much isolated. Yeah. Yes. F Oh, good grief. That, that does sound neat, C but I don't think I, I've got quite enough nerve to do that. I know my husband's gone, F uh, for several days on the Appalachian Trail before, C and he said that you can, a lot of times you can go for, D you know, a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail. C So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think. Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. I think it would be, yeah. D Well, that sounds really neat. Well. I don't know, F uh, we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague C and, F uh, I, maybe, like you said, start out slow and, and kind of get used to it, and find out that it, maybe it's not as bad as I, I fear it might be <laughter>. Yeah.
