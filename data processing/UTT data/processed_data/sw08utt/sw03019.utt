Okay D so, I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day, C and I like it just for the noise <laughter>. F Um. F Um, it just depends on what it is. E I mean, I have my favorite things that I do, C and then some fun thing to do sometime. F Um, what about you? Right. D Well D see that's great, yeah. D Well, Right. D Well, I think that, D well, part, I think that's partially true, too. I think you have to have the will and the, C and, F uh, D anyway, I think it, you are, you would be susceptible to stuff. C And it has to be reinforced at another level too. C But, D anyway, what would you watch, if you had, D you know, this week to watch? Do you like specials? Oh. Oh <laughter>. F Oh, right, yeah. D Well, we have cable also, C and sometimes you can, F um, get the H B O specials, C and sometimes those are really, pretty hysterical. C So, I, I like to watch comedy, E I mean, C and that's something. C But, I am not, real up to date on what's going on now, I, I guess I have my old favorites, C but I am, hooked on, D you know D like Bob Newhart is still on. I watch him. C And, F uh, D you know, something on that level, I, I also enjoy, F uh, I do not know, Sunday mornings, it's Channel Thirteen, I watch a lot, of Thirteen, F uh, THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP, C and I, I just laugh, E I mean, I think that's so hysterical, these guys. It's just so much fun. It's just, it's just a lot of fun, watching that. E I mean, I do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the, they say, <laughter> C but it's fun. D You know, C so, yeah, I like to be entertained, I really do <laughter>. F Oh, D now that was fabulous, C and that, D you know, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. D So, D You know, D well, there's certain thin, E I mean, I have got, F um, my T V in the kitchen here C and, F uh, D you know, if there's something like cooking shows. I love to watch cooking shows. I, I really do. I know <laughter>, <Laughter>. I, I, yeah. C And, C and there's some, F um, in fact, one of the water color shows, I know, has inspired me to take water color lessons, D you know. D So, D you know, things like that, you get, a whole lot of exposure. Yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> She got you a <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, D well, D see that's, C But she was probably depressed to begin with. You know what I mean? Yeah, grumpy to begin with. <laughter> Yeah. Uhhuh. I hate that show <laughter>. Yeah. I, I, Good. <Laughter>. Is not that amazing. How old are your kids? F Oh, okay, C so that's, Yeah. I had forgotten about that, D see, it's just my husband and I C and, so I do not have that, D you know, I, that constant influence, of the kids shows and all that, C but, F uh, F um, I don't know. Yeah. <Laughter> Right. Right. C And, C and D you know we get it at school, too, D anyway, C so you might as well not, reinforce it <laughter>, D you know. I know, I remember going to sch, my parents were a lot like, too C and of course, we did not have any of the variety, D you know, kids have, C but, all the watch RAWHIDE and all those shows. C And, my parents never let me watch anything like that. I could watch YOGI BEAR, D you know, what kind of culture was that <laughter>? C And, I remember going to school the next day C and everybody would be asking, F oh, did you see that, did you see how he did that C and did you see, C and I could never participate. C And it always made me feel a little bit, D you know, a loner D like I, D you know, C But, F uh, C But D see, then my parents, I think then you have to replace it with other things. D You know, to, F uh, <Laughter>. Really. Yeah. That's true. C Or, you go rent a video up at, the store and come home and sit down and watch it. D Well that's, D you know, that's something people do not do, D well, here we are talking on that subject, C but that's, that's an interesting concept I have got to stick in my, F uh, D You know work with kids C but, F uh,. First how much television watching do you do? Uhhuh. That's right, C but do you actually watch it, pay attention to it C or is it more of a company? Uhhuh. Uhhuh, okay. Right. D Well, D actually, I work full time C and when I am not working I am running C and I do not watch a lot of television C and I am very selective in what I watch. If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off. I probably watch television four hours a week, max. C And, C and, F uh, if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, D well, then I just do not turn it on. I would rather listen to music. Part of it is that, F uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis C and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us C and we do not know where that influence came from. Yeah. F Uh, right, right, right. Of course, I, F uh, That's right. I, F uh, D Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. Those are fascinating to me. If I have the opportunity, I watch it. Unfortunately, I was with someone else who was flipping channels. I hate that. <laughter> I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor. In our comedy programs, although, <inhaling> nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can, C but I would prefer to find, <inhaling> a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians. Uhhuh. That's right, C and some of those are fine programs. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I, I enjoy comedy. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I enjoy that, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's right. Uhhuh <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. Right. D Well <sigh>, Yeah. I watch it for entertainment, C but I also watch it for, F uh, cultural impact. I do a lot of channel thirteen, channel three, some of the educational channels, C and I watch for special programs that have special, a special play, a special concert, F uh, I recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars. F Uh, C and it was fabulous. I was just absolutely, you just held you breath, in some of those. C and, F uh, F oh, I was just, it makes chills all, over you. C So, I, I may or may not even look at the T V guide, C but if I have time I may flip through and say D hey this looks good if I finish this task I can watch that in an hour. <inhaling> F Uh, if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to watch it, so what. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Noise> <swallowing> <<sounds like she is drinking something>> I do too, it makes me want to cook, C and then I eat, C and then I get fat, C so, I just let other people watch <laughter> then I eat what they cook <laughter>. F Oh, I think that's, marvelous. Yeah. F Oh, yeah, I took a lot of my, college courses, I took some of my, college courses on television, C so that, it's very successful for some of, those things, C but I think <inhaling> I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life, C or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life, F uh, <sigh> my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps, C and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old <laughter> woman <laughter> ever walked. Absolutely, I do not know who she thought she was, C but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice, and that attitude being demonstrated. <inhaling> C And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal. C And, D Well, I do not know. D Well, she was grumpy to begin with. There's no doubt about that, C but, F uh, C but you could clearly see those influences, and in my youngsters, I know that one day, F uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES, C and I always thought that was just casual slap stick, comedy, C but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I decided that was not funny, any more. C And, I really, I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW. I think that is, the kids watch that C and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw. C And I just, I do not like it. <Clinking> <swallowing> <<sounds like ice against a glass, then drinking something>> Mine are grown, C but I have grandchildren. And, young children around, C and, F uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. D Well, I was very careful even when my kids were, kids were at home. C And when they were young I was, really did, F uh, watch what they watched. I was cau, I sat down with them C and I watched it, C and if I did not like it, I changed the channel for them. D You know, I, D you know, I distracted them, changed their interest. Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos. I just wou, Sure. That's right, that's right. Gosh, they got, they are mouthy enough anyway. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah D well, Uhhuh <noise>. Uhhuh. <Noise> Sure, I can, understand how that would happen. Absolutely, D well, I did, I ran my kids to death <laughter>. I said, D hey, I think that's enough television for awhile, maybe we need to go outside, C and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company. C So I would go out with them, D now D see there's the problem, parents do not do that. They, say, you go outside and play, Yeah. I said, C but, C but, we went on field trips C and we did other things. C And I think that was, Of course,
