<Talking> Okay. D So, F uh, then, do you keep kids? Is this two year old yours C or do you keep children for other people? F Oh, that's exactly what I have. Yes. I know. I, my, my little girl was three and a half in March C and my son was two in January. That's pretty close. Yeah. Yes, it is. Have you been able to do that all along C or, Yeah. F Oh, how neat. How old were they when you adopted? C So he probably doesn't remember. Oh. Yeah, definitely needed. D Well, that's, that's pretty interesting. D Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids D you know. That was always my dream, D you know. I wasn't necessarily a career person C but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could. C And my husband was in the type of business that, D you know, it's insurance C so you have to build a clientele C and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit. C And so I haven't been able to quit yet. C So I've had to deal a lot with child care C and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home. C But, F uh, I started out, F uh, my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August C and it worked out pretty good. D You know, we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else. D You know, the friendship is more important. C And, F uh, it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them, D you know. She loved them like they were hers C and I I knew, D you know, I had good peace of mind. I knew that they were taken care of C and, Yeah. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Huh. C But she had no help? She had no help? She was alone with them. F Oh, that is hard. Yeah. Jeez. I don't either <laughter>. C So. Yeah. You have to let them have some wild time if that's considered wild <laughter>. Yeah. . Right. Right. Yes. Yeah. D Well, when, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me C and we'd work it out. After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, D you know, they needed it financially. She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy C and I though, D well, D you know, we'll try her. C But she came to our house C and that just did not work. F Uh, E I mean, she loved the kids C and she was good with them. C But, F uh, D you know, they were filthy <laughter> when I'd get home. D Now I understand kids go out and play C and they get dirty <Laughter> C but E I mean filthy. I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair C and the C and I was, like, gosh. C And then, D you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, D you know, the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs C and the, and clean, C and I was like, Yeah. C And then, in the end, F uh, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me C so I was, I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth. She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning. D Well, D you know, I work eight to five thirty C so what am I supposed to do <laughter>. C So I, D well, I had been sick C and I, it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick. C So I stayed home with them C and we went to some of the Kindercares. Yeah. D Well, that's what they said. There were two pretty near our house C and they said, D well, bring them in this week for a free day C so I lined up someone Tuesday. They had a Mother's Day Out that my babysitter took them to, D you know, which was fine. They liked it. They had been going to it for years. C And so I stayed with them Monday. Tuesday they went to that. Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare. Thursday I took them to another Kindercare <laughter>, C and then Friday my husband and I split. C But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares. They, They didn't give him. Oh. F Oh, that's horrible. C And doing something with him. D Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have <laughter> D you know. I didn't, I, D you know, we're, we're a Christian family C and, D you know, they, because they're, D you know, like public, <printer> they're not private D you know. They can't pray, they can't talk about God. They can't do anything like that C and I don't want them indoctrinated D you know, C but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, D you know, and things like that. Yeah. Yeah, basic. C So, F uh, I talked to another lady at church. It was like Thursday of that week C and she said F oh, I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter C and I've know this girl, I went to college with her C so I really, I, you, I, I value her opinion. C And she told me about a private one. It, it was associated with one of the churches here. It's not the church I go to C but it's, D you know, it, it was Lubbock View Christian Church C and it's a private academy. C And so I went over there C and I talked to the lady. D Well, they have like a three year waiting list. C But she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio C and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time. C And she said I should know something by tomorrow, which was Friday, C and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot. C And so Friday afternoon at five thirty, she called me C and she said she's going. You can bring your kids Monday <lipsmack>. I know. I was just like, God set this, up for me. He knew I needed this C and, F uh, C so since October then, they have been going there C and i, I love it. I have been at such peace with myself. It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles C and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares <printer> were going to be. Did you hear my printer in the background. I'm sorry. I hope you can understand what I s, <laughter>. Yeah. I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit. C So, they don't have to charge as much. C And the hours are wonderful C and I just, I think it's the best thing. I told Russ yest, that we should have done this a long time ago D you know <laughter>. It's great. C So I guess as long as I have to work, I feel good that they're there. they're getting the love, the care. They have a little curriculum. They teach them, D you know, the alphabet, the numbers, the things which, D you know, if they learn, they learn. If they don't, they don't. I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three C but it's kind of neat when they come home with it, D you know. C and, F uh, Yeah. F Oh, C and the teachers. D Well, Taylor got bit several times C and Taylor bit several times C and the teachers dealt with that. We're like, hey they're two C and we keep them apart C and we scold them C and we correct them C and, D you know, they mark it all down C and they let you know C and, <swallowing> C and, D you know, they get over it real quick C and he doesn't do it anymore C and they work at the potty train, I just, just C so mu, I don't know. I just feel like a big burden was lifted <laughter>. It is. I know. I know C and that's hard. Yeah <sniffing>. D Well, C and it, it, D you know, C but I understa, I, I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also. Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C And that's usually like, D you know, I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out, it was like from nine to three C so that was a pretty good pretty good time, D you know. My babysitter would take them and then pick them up. C So, that worked out real good. D Well, I'm tickled to death. I hope you find something C and it was good talking to you. D Well, I guess. It said child care criteria C and I think we both listed an experience <laughter>. C And you too. Bye <clicking> <talking>. <Noise> <<dryer>> <child_talking> <TV> No. I have two children. I have a two year old and a three and a half year old. Really? That's wild. <Laughter>. F Oh, boy. D Well, mine was two in March C and the three and a half year old will be four in, in July. C So that is pretty close <laughter>. C But I'm home with the kids all day C and I have really, F uh, tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us. C But, Pretty much, pretty much. F Uh, I work parttime C but, F uh, my husband's able, D you know, mostly to take care of them when I'm working. C So. C But, F uh, we adopted these two little guys C and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, D you know, they have had a couple foster homes already. The baby was eleven weeks old C and his brother was twenty, twentytwo months. Yeah. C So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, boy. Yeah. F Oh, that's neat. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's the hardest thing I think, D you know to, to deal with is that people love your, kids. I put, F uh, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, D you know that kind of thing C and, F uh, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out C and the, the teacher had eleven kids. It was excellent, supposedly. The reputation was fantastic for this place. Was supposed to be an excellent school C and I had several friends who had, had recommended it, too. C But it really gets down to the particular teacher. C And she was a new teacher at the school C and she had eleven, D you know, three year olds in a room C and I just think it was way too much. The were almost all boys. Pardon? I didn't think much. I don't think much. Yeah. C And she was just my, F uh, three year old is real active. C And she just kept saying how wild he was. D Well, D you know, there was kind of a connotation there of him being, D you know, it being a problem. D Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said. D Well, D you know, at three years old I don't find that to be a behavioral problem <laughter>. D You know <laughter>. E I mean, it's kind of like she was, there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more C and it's really hard to con, you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, D you know. Yeah, D you know. C So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons. It was expensive. C But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time. C But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, <sigh> D you know, you really can't know everything about what's going to happen. I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, D you know, because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms. C And I felt like that was a big factor for me. That they would would be safe D you know, from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Child_crying> F Oh, gosh. You had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably. F Oh gosh. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. I was, I took the kids there once just to try it. They had a free day at Kindercare. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. I didn't either. I had one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him. C And the other one was that the, the younger one got bit really badly by another child C and what they did was they took my <swallowing> younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day. Instead of taking the kid that was biting out <laughter> and do something with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C So you feel like your values aren't getting, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. God loves you. D You know, basic things like that. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Wow. F Oh, what luck. <Dishes>. Really <laughter>. F Oh, that's great. Yeah <dishes>. F Oh, really? Wow. That's okay <laughter>. I got the dryer going in the background C so <laughter>. Yeah. F Oh, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They think it's fun. It's not a big, D you know trauma to them to learn something. Yeah. Yeah. Really. Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't do anything with them here. I can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so into everything C and the older brother is <laughter> D you know, running around all over the place C so it is, it's hard. Yeah. Yeah. C So. Yeah, I need to. Even for just a couple days a, mornings a week or something to have something like that, C so I, I think I'm going to look for that. Remind me of that now that you mention it <laughter>. I was, been meaning to do that, D you know. Because some of the churches do have them, F uh, D you know, for like six dollars per child C and that's not that big a deal, D you know. For a couple times <sigh>. Yeah. Yeah <thumping>. That's sounds good. D Well, thanks. Did we cover everything we need to? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. D Well, great. D Well, thanks a lot. You have a good day. Byebye <clicking> <noise> <child_talking> <TV>.
