Of a exercise program you have. Right. D Well, swimming is, F uh, one of the best exercises you can do. <Baby_talking> E I mean as far as for, F uh, cardiovascular C and C and it's least hard on your body, I, It's the least hard on your body as far as, F uh, impact C and Right, right. D Well, I do, F uh, little aerobics, F oh, three or four times a week, C but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles C and, F uh, D well, D you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, F uh half hour or so, C but C so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to. I like it. I like it, F uh, part of my problem is I have small children, C so, F uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, F oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, F uh, deal, D you know, F uh, when you're in college, boy. You got a hundred things going on. Of course, you got a little different direction going, C but, F uh. Right, you don't notice it as much, yeah. You feel it, don't you? It's amazing how, F uh, how much, F uh, it changes, C and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, F oh, I don't know how many years, C but, F uh, it's changed places <laughter>. C And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same. C But, F uh, C so, do you do, F uh, in Texas, F uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities. Do you enjoy it, C or is it, F uh. If you can have, find the time it's just the. Yeah, it is hard it is hard. It's, F uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour. My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more <laughter>. Don't get enough sleep as it is, right C and, F uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, F uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, D you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release. You feel invigorated C and you feel <Inhaling> F oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods. If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something. I do. I have to be real careful. Did you? Makes a lot of difference. D Well, there's a lot of fat in meat. Right. C And unless you really like, F uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, C but, F uh. Kind of see what happens. I've tried to do that with sugar C and, it's almost impossible everything has sugar in it. E I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it. Course, C and I like sugar, too, that's that's a problem, C but. D Anyway, D well, it's, F uh, nice talking to you. Think we've, F uh, covered all the subject. Okay. D Well, you, too. Good luck, F uh, enjoy college while you can. Let me tell you it's, F uh. It's a little different, F uh challenge, isn't it? Where are you going studying? Right. D Well, F um, <throat_clearing> I have a, a, a former exercise program. I'm a graduate student, C and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, D you know, back to regular exercise. F Um, <throat_clearing> last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard, C so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming C and, F um, C and since I worked at a recreation center I could, F uh, D you know, use those facilities quite often. C But, F um. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh, C and there's C and there's no jarring on the. Pardon? Exactly, yeah, F um, flu, yeah, fluid resistance. Uhhuh, uhhuh. How about you? F Oh, yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, C or do you enjoy it? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure, yeah. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, yeah. F Uh, I, F um, I used to, F uh, I used to weigh, F uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, C and now I weigh only about one, about one seventyfive. F Um, <throat_clearing> C so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, C and, F uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, C and so I got my weight down, C and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, F uh, D you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be I don't worry about it , yeah. Uhhuh. Although lately I have noticed, D you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it C and, Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, there are. F Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, C and so right downstairs there's a facility. C And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, D you know, all we have to do is, is, F uh, run down there C and. I really do if I have the time to. Uhhuh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, D you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, C but that's hard, <laughter> D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Exactly. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, yeah, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly? Uhhuh. I stopped eating meat about, F oh, F uh, must have been eight months ago. Uhhuh, completely. E I mean, any kind of meat C or, C and I, C and I really feel a lot better <throat_clearing> now. Yeah, it really does. Uhhuh, yeah, that's it, E I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from C and so. I found that really helps. . Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, C but <throat_clearing> I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens. Yeah, C and I like it. <Laughter>. <Laughter> I don't know if I'm that brave yet. <Laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Okay, yeah, it sounds good. D Well, good luck to you there in Idaho. D Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, <throat_clearing> I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, it is. D Well, it's good talking, Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
