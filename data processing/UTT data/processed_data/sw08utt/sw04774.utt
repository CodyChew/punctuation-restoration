Been on the line for awhile. I almost forgot what the topic <laughter> was. F Uh, C but I know what it is. <Laughter>. <Noise> F Uh, let me see. I, I, I, I, I'm kind of, I don't, D you know, I'm, I'm kind of in the <static> middle. I, I think it's a great idea C but when it comes to me, it's D like, almost an insult, D you know, C so <child> it's <lipsmack> I, I've come from the teaching field. C So, C so it's just like I don't know. I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go with, F uh, I, I, I'd be for it. <Child_yelling> D You know. C But, F uh, D you know, I, I, I don't know. It's just kind of a, kind of a delicate subject I guess. C But I, I, I would, I would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, D you know. If it's got to be done for everyone. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You kind of goes into your privacy C and D you know, C but I guess if they, D you know, D you know, there's, F uh, I guess there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it. C And it, it seems to be working out C so, Yeah. Right. <Lipsmack> D See, that's hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then I kind of hear it goes into D like, F uh, this is just something I've heard that it kind of goes into D like, F uh, just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold. That it kind of affects that too. F Oh, I didn't know that. <Noise>. F Um. Yeah. D See things like that C so, <Child> Yeah. Right, right. Uhhuh. See that's, Yeah. That's where I kind of get into, C cause it kind of gets into your personal life, D you know. C And wha, what's kind of next. The what? Huh. Oh. Yeah. Right. Yeah <noise>. Right. C So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually? I kind of think they will. Yeah. Yeah. We haven't either. Yeah. C But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, D you know. It's just, <lipsmack> because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff C and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah <static>. Okay. F Uh, based, F Oh, okay. Good. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. So do I <laughter>. Uhhuh. Right. I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it should be random testing, it should be for everybody. D You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier C and they'd run into less problems. Because, F uh, I don't know, I come from the teaching field too C and it sort of, F uh, <laughter> it's a pro and a con ty, I don't know where to stand on it. I'm more or less, if they told me I had to D well then fine, C but if, D you know, if they made me then I'd probably, if I had my druthers I'd probably say D well no <laughter> D you know just this, Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think it's, it's, what they're basically trying to do, I don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow, what they're basically trying to do is, F uh, F oh D gosh, F uh, any people who had di, tested positively, getting them into a drug program. Or rehab program. C And, F uh, anybody who, F uh, D gee, is, D you know, di, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off. I, I think that's really hard to because, D you know, you never know. I don't know, it, that's a, it's really weird issue. I'm sort of on the fence about it. C But I, D you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow. F Oh, we can get you into a drug program. C But then you wear that stigma D you know <laughter>. Where, F uh, D like a lot of people are saying, D well I only smoked a joint last night, I don't have any problems <laughter> D you know. Or something like that, yeah. Right. Anything with an, a, D you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine or, Yeah, somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in, D you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive test. I know I'm an epileptic C so I'd probably test positive C and <laughter> C and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system, D you know <laughter>. C And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you <laughter>. D You know, it's very personal. I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then I'd always wonder if they fired me, D you know, why did you fire me <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. It, it hits me as the Orwell thing. Big brother is watching <laughter>. Orwell. C And, D you know, his book. Brig, big brother is watching. D You know, you're being controlled. <Laughter> That type of deal C and I sh, I don't really, D you know, I don't know. Seems awful strange <noise>. I'd hate to have to, if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't I'd probably take the company who didn't? Because I feel there'd be more trust in the employee. C But I can understand why they need it with all the, D you know, train accidents and everything else. I think they will too because, F uh, D you know, it's just going to follow. I don't know. I, we haven't had any of it in our school system. C So, F uh, D you know hopefully, we won't <laughter>. Right. D Well C and eventually it's going to be not only the tea, D you know, the kids are going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers. C And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids. C And then they, D you know, caught everybody.
