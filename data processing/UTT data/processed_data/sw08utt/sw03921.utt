Okay. Yes, I love to fish. D Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes. And, yes, and from the banks. I don't like to go out on boats. <Laughter>. D Well, it, F uh, down here we usually catch catfish and bass, stripped bass, D you know, where I fish. And trout up at, F uh, Lake Shasta when I go up there. C But, I like it all except, F uh, D really I don't, I don't really care that much for the trout. I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout <laughter>. Uhhuh. D See. D Well, F uh, like in, F uh, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, F huh? D You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa. C And, F uh, D you know, we use to catch those little bullheads C and that's, they look just like baby catfish. D You know, F uh, did you get to go fishing very often? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, you like to eat them after you catch them? <laughter>. C Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing, C but they don't like to eat them. D You know. Yeah, I know. If I go to a restaurant and order fish, it's usually C either salmon C or, F uh, red snapper. D You know <laughter>. We, F uh, skin them. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just cut their heads off and skin them C and then I just, F uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them. I don't put that corn meal on them. D You know, F uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them C so <laughter>, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well D you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, F uh, catfish quite that big. F Uh, most of them are just the small, D you know, pan frying ones. D So, F uh, F Um. <Laughter> Wouldn't that be something? <laughter>. It's a thrill when you get a big fish though, isn't it? D You know. Uhhuh. C So when you were, when you did go fishing where did you go? You moved there from where? Nebraska? C So, it was just like the rivers and, F uh, the lakes I suppose, F huh? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, are you a fisher person, are you? Great. What kind of fishing do you do? In California? Oh. D Well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods? Uhhuh. Oh. D Well, <laughter> I, I don't blame you. I grew up in Nebraska and, F uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River C and then, F uh, we moved to, F uh, South Dakota and, F uh, did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River C and, F uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, F uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing C but, F uh, I still, F uh, I am sort of a catfish man at heart. Yep. Yeah, they do. Oh. Yeah. F Oh yeah. I like to fish. The only problem is I just moved to Texas C so it's been a little over a year now C but, F uh I, I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here C and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now C and it's driving me crazy C but, F uh, one of these days, I will go over to, F uh, Lake Lewisville or, F uh, <inhaling> A what is it, F uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while <laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, yeah, sure. D Well mo, Yeah. Most of the time, F uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it. F Uh, C and you're right. E I mean I like to fish for trout C and they are really, F uh, F uh, good fighters C but, F uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, F uh, C so, do you just, F uh, F uh, skin your catfish C or do you fillet them out, how do you, how do you, Do you? Okay. Yeah. No. D Well, that's how we do it too. F Uh, although we, F uh, use to set some, F uh, trout lines out C and we've caught, D you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish C and sometimes those are good to, F uh, do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and, F uh, do it with, F uh, butter on, F uh, on, on tin foil C and then the skin just basically scrapes right off C and, F uh, wer, C and it really tastes pretty good. There, F uh, Yeah. D Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, F uh, a rod and reel C but, F uh so far it's just been on, F uh, on the trout lines C so, Yeah. Yeah. C And, F uh, D well up in, F uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, F uh, tied into a few northern pike C and, F uh, they really, F uh, in, in, when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish, C but in the summer time, they'll, F uh, give you a run for your money. Uhhuh. Yeah. In, In Nebraska? F Uh, yeah. Most of the time, F uh, we just fished, F uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in. C And a lot of them ended up being close to the river, C so if the river every, F uh, flooded, D you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits C and so we would do a lot of fishing there too C but, F uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for,
