Do you, F uh, have a family budget, C or, how do you work your budgeting? Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, D well, we don't have a real strict budget. F Uh, we have a, a low budget to work on, C but we, F uh, D you know, for like groceries, we say about this much per week C and then we just spend about so much. We don't, I, I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we, D you know, keep to or anything, C but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within, D you know, five dollars between here and there. A certain amount. Yeah. Oh. Wow, that's great. Oh. F Oh, you guys sound pretty self sufficient <laughter>. Huh. Yeah. D Well, that's a good idea. Let's see, the other thing there the topic was talking about was, if, if, F uh, all I can think of is if you don't keep a real, a real tight budget, how do you control expenses, C but, F uh, one, another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas. D Well, not fly back, C but somehow we get back there. C And, F uh, this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive C and, Huh? F Oh, yeah. C And, F uh, D you know, we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare. C And so, F uh, we find that if we're careful with our, D you know, just everyday things like grocery shopping and, and gas and entertainment, things like that, then, F uh, somewhere in, out in the wash, it will come out that we have enough to get back there. D You know. Uhhuh, that's all right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, that's right. Yeah, D well, whenever <laughter>, I don't know if this is part of the topic, C but whenever I find, D you know, a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up <laughter>. Uhhuh, yeah, I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in. D You know, just count it up at the end of the year, something. C But, yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, <throat_clearing> for many, many years, F uh, my wife and I did have a budget. F Uh, we were both working at the time and so forth C and, F uh, that, we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and, and other big bills taken care of. F Uh, we have a, a budget, C but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation. C So it, it's, F uh, it's helpful. E I mean, yes, having a budget is very, very important C and that did get us so that, D you know, the house is paid for and, F uh, other major things are taken care of C and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before, C so we don't have to have quite as strict, F uh, a budget as we did. Sure, uhhuh. Uhhuh. I think I've, I do that automatically myself. E I mean, I unconsciously, F uh, D you know, stay in a, within a, with a certain amount because I, I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time. All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or <laughter> something like that. <Throat_clearing> Yeah, we have two freezers, C and, course, we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff C and we freeze a lot of that, C so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own p, personal storage. <Laughter> D Well, we, we keep a little note pad on a, on a wall. W, if anything is absolutely out, make a note of it C and then, F uh, the next time I go to the store, why, I pick it up and fill it up. C So it's, it's worked very well that way. That way we <throat_clearing>, D you know, if each of us finds something is missing, F uh, we put it up. F Uh, the other person might not know about it. That way we keep up to date <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, D actually, it's more interesting, too, if you've got the time. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. Sure. D Well, I think we unconsciously <throat_clearing> do the same thing. E Excuse me, my throat's not as clear today as it should be. F Uh, we are, F uh, going to be traveling to Europe with a choral. We sing with a so called Pennsylvania choral C and we make a two weeks tour of, of, F uh, foreign countries C and, of course, that costs money. C So we, F uh, each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that, that we gather together over a period a time enough money to, to make this trip. C So th, that is another way of, F uh, budgeting C and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it. We, F uh, just live a normal life, C but we don't throw any money away, particularly. We save it for this trip, which is, F uh, always very, very nice. <Laughter> I do the same thing. I have a whole pile of them saved that I have found by parking meters <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, let's face it, the, when we're talking budget, it is important to, to have a budget <throat_clearing>, C and, F uh, I, I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account C and I have a money market account also. C And, F uh, I keep those levels up above a certain minimum, C and I'm always trying to,
