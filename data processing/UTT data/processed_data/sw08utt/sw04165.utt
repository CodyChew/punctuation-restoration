<Click> Steve, this is, like I mentioned, Brian and I guess we're going to want to be talking about child care. F Uh, do you have any experience in, F uh, finding child care? Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, we're kind of lucky. I, I'm, F uh, I'm working. My wife isn't working C and she is taking care of the kids also. C And, C and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice. C But I do have, like you mentioned, a lot of friends, a lot of, F uh, coworkers and associates that are looking for child care C and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care. F Uh, what kind of, D you know, F uh, guidance counselor to student or, D you know, F uh, adult to child relationship. How many D you know, you don't want to have thirty or forty <laughter> kids and only one adult. Then F uh, something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to, F uh, accommodate or take care of the kids very well. C And, F uh, they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time. C So, D you know, depends also upon the, the level of the child. We, F uh, we, F uh, take a very close look at finding a, a preschool, a good preschool for our kid. C And I kind of relate that to that in, in making sure that the, the, F uh, teachers are very well educated themselves. They have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them. C And it's very important, I feel, F uh, that the kids interact with other children also. It's a, it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and, F uh, get to know and work with kids. C So. I don't know. I, I guess we're kind of in the same boat. We haven't had to look very carefully for child care. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Uhhuh. Right, right <noise>. I think it's, F uh, important. Like you mentioned, that's a good idea on the, F uh, parent coop because, F uh, <swallowing> I'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids C and I don't want to just take them to somebody I pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere. I want to trust the people <swallowing>. C And, F uh, D you know, you hear in the newspa, you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of, of people that, D you know, don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of, C so. C And hope to never get into that situation where we have to, have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children. C And hope that we can stay in this situation <laughter> for awhile. C So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> That's true, that's true. D Well, Steven, it's been, <TV> D Well, ourselves, we have <sigh>, I guess never had to look for child care. Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen. C But, F uh, <throat_clearing> C and so, D you know, you go back those many years and, F uh, we didn't do it very much. We, I guess, we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at, F uh, two family income at the time <swallowing>. C And our kids were older. C But I've had to deal with, F uh, D you know, friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing. F Uh, C so it, my involvement hasn't been direct C but still have been, D you know, certainly exposed to criteria people are using. How about yourself? Right. Right. Right <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. I, <throat_clearing> I kind of think that, F uh, D you know, some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care. C But even, D you know, here. I guess we have <inhaling> in one sense two forms <sigh> of, F uh, child care. There's where individuals will <swallowing> in one, primarily babysit children in their own home. C And that will be groups of anywhere <<mispronounced>> from one or two to, maybe, seven or eight children. C And then otherwise, there will be <throat_clearing>, the majority are cooperative daycares. F Uh, people form a coop and, F uh, parents will work in the coop and put a fair number of hours. Frequently, they will hire staff to be at the daycare C and the emphasis is primarily, F uh, someplace for the children to be. C But, at the same time, there's some fairly good training programs and, and some of them formal two year programs. F Uh, C so that, D you know, there is some definite, F uh, creative play, good social interaction, that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. D You know, we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here C and <throat_clearing> I guess, D you know, it, are, it's, F uh, typically, F uh, whether it's been child care in a home <swallowing> or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution. C And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children C and it's not, C and it's more of a group home rather than actually daycare s, type of facility. F Uh <TV>.
