D Well, are you in the market for a new car? Oh. What sort of requirements to you have for your car? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. I see <laughter>. Top of, <laughter> top of the line. Oh. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I guess I'm, F uh, more traditional in that I don't like p, <laughter> power windows or power locks, because the people that I know h, who have them always seem to have trouble with them. C And, F uh, C so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work <laughter>. C And then I want, D you know, good, F uh, gas mileage C and I want an air bag C and, F uh, I guess, No, I haven't. Have you? Somehow I just think, D you know, I like the idea <laughter>. Right. Right, that's a good idea. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I, D actually I don't know a lot about different brands. I tend to have, D you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American C and my requirements were basically, D you know, good repair record, good mileage, F uh, <lipsmack> C and I needed airconditioning C and, F uh, <lipsmack> can't remember what my, F oh, I wanted s, F uh, stick shift. C And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice <laughter>. There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, D you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a <laughter> stick shift in it. It, it turned out to be a, a Chrysler. F Uh <lipsmack>, Lancer. Yeah. No, a five speed. C And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, C and so it had been on the lot three months C and they were really eager to sell it. C So, I guess in this area, at least, D you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move. D Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one C and I thought it would be more reliable. F Uh, <Laughter> I found that out. <Laughter> E I mean, D you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement C so, D So, D Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore. At least in this area. Not that I was looking for sports cars, C but, D now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift. C And so why do you like stick shift? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. Right, C and D actually it's probably safer on, D you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active. D So, <Laughter>. F Uh, D well, yeah, I am as a matter of fact. D Well, D act, actually I'm looking for another car, C but, F uh, F uh, new, probably not. F Uh, sports car. F Uh, usually C either black C or red. And electric windows, and power locks <laughter>. D Now, D Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, F uh, F uh, D you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, F uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window. It is just a real pain, C or, D you know, if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, F uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window. C And, F uh, C so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, F uh, just really help a lot <laughter>. What about you? <Laughter>. Oh. Sure. Have you ever had a car with an air bag? No. D Well, it, it see, sure seems to save lives C and F uh, yeah. I, D actually, I like the antilock brakes. C And I have never had a chance to, I have been in cars that have had them, C but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, F uh, D you know, on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up. C But, F uh, you think you'd buy, F uh, an American car or a European or Japanese? What was that? Huh, stick shift, huh? Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed? Wow. D Well, D actually, I much prefer a stick shift C and, what, I'm, I'm curious. I, I know why I love a stick shift. Why d, <laughter> why did you want one? Uhhuh. It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Huh, yeah. No, E I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift. Huh. Huh. F Uh, I guess I, I grew up on it C and it's fun. It's, it's an enjoyable part of driving. I do feel like I have, F uh, more control over the car C and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions. F Uh, it, i, it does, F uh, I don't know, it, it's really more fun than anything else. As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun <laughter>. Yeah, yeah <sniffing>. Yeah, F uh, of course, I like gadgets and, and, F uh, fun things, <Laughter> on the cars, which are all the things, course, the c,
