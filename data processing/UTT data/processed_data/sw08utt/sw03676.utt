What kind of movies have you been seeing lately? F Oh, it's an excellent movie. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? What was that anyway? . Okay. Uhhuh. Let's see, who was in FISHER KING? That was, F um, Robin Williams C and, F uh C and, F uh, I can't the last name. F Uh, we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately. F Um, we really enjoyed, F um, DEAD POETS' SOCIETY. F Um, several years back one we saw, we saw we really, really enjoyed was, F uh, ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, F uh, Timothy Hutton and, F uh, Mary Tyler Moore, C and, F uh, F uh, who played the father, anyway excellent movie. Yes we have. F Oh, we loved it. <Laughter> I know what you mean. I know what you mean. Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done. F Uh, he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD, C but, F uh, E I mean, D you know, basic <throat_clearing> thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit. F Oh, no. It's a good movie. D Well, F um, they did a real good job with it. F Um, they didn't try to make him super human or, D you know, invincible. They just, just, he worked hard at it. . No I haven't, not an opportunity to see that, F uh, Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. It sounds kind of like one, F uh, we saw at home here on the, rented it, F um, CLARA'S HEART. F Um, Whoopi Goldberg. C And she played a, F uh, the, F uh, she's a housekeeper. Yeah, she's a housekeeper she. She was a, F oh, A now I can't say it, a Haitian. Anyway, she, F uh, she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy, C but then again, she's got a whole lot on the ball, C and the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, more than, more than, D you know, it wasn't a mystery, it wasn't, D you know, blood and guts and violence and, and car chases type thing. It was just a good movie. A KISS BEFORE DYING. C And. Yeah. Yeah. That, that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching. . F Oh, okay. F Uh, it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies. Course, my, my favorite now is, is DANCES WITH WOLVES. F Uh, SILENCE OF THE LA, F uh, of the LAMBS was good. Uhhuh. F Oh, it's a, I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it. It's with, F uh, Jodie Foster. C And it, F uh, it's pretty good. Another one that I think I really liked was, F uh, THE FISHER KING. Right. How about you? What are you? Yes. Right. That was, that was an excellent movie. Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES? What'd you think of it? I don't think I can see it enough times. <Laughter> Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan. No, C but D you know, it wasn't a bad movie. It got such bad reviews, D really, C and, C and I thoroughly enjoyed it. C But I, then I wasn't expecting any classic either. I thought so. Have you seen THE FISHER KING? F Uh, it, you, D you know, I guess it, it really isn't for everybody. It's, it's pretty deep and, F uh, F uh, philosophical. C But I thought it had a wonderful message to it. It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said, D You know, I think I liked that <laughter>. C And then the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, D You know, I did like it <laughter>. C But when you first came out, you weren't real sure. Haven't seen that. F Oh, yes, I did, yes, I did. F Uh, the nanny type. Housekeeper, uhhuh. I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING. Uhhuh. I had not heard about it when it was on the movies, but was out on video. C And it's with Sean Young. C And it's a, it's a mystery. It was very predictable, E I mean, you knew, you knew when the murder was going to happen or something, C but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable. That's right. I had, F uh, F uh, I like the, I think it's called the, F uh, <breathing> RAZOR'S EDGE, C but, no no, the JAGGED EDGE, the JAGGED EDGE with, F uh,
