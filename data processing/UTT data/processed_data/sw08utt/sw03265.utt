D Well, I've been real, F um, <baby> thinking I'd love to buy a new car, right now, if I could afford it. C But we have two cars right now C and we're still paying on them, C but I would love to have one of these new mini vans. I've got two little ones C and I think that would be just the perfect family car <dishes>. Oh <laughter>. <Dishes>. <Dishes>. What is it? Oh. <Laughter>. <Noise>. <Noise> Yeah. We have, F um, we have, <noise> we went out to buy an American car C so we bought, F um, a Chevy Nova about three years ago. C And, C and we opened up the, the hood C and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the front of all the engine parts <laughter>. Uhhuh. Toyota, F uh, D well, the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry. F Uh, at that time was the same car C so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to. I thought that was pretty n, <Dishes>. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written, E I mean, imprinted on the engine. It was real interesting. C But, F uh, I, with so many options now available, <children> D you know, where, where cars are concerned, it just seems like there is, there's almost too much of a choice anymore. D You know, there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever. I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into consideration the price naturally. C But, F um, <dishes> D you know, I would really want something that I would want <child> for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars <child_talking> or whatever. F Oh, yea, definitely <laughter>. <Child_crying>. <Dishes>. <Dishes>. I cannot <rustling> imagine that, D you know, <clicking> somebody, I heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about, F oh, it would, how, exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase, C and I thought, I don't think I'd find that exciting <dishes>. I'd be wondering, D you know, here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money <laughter>. That's true. <Child>. <Child> Yeah. <Baby_talking>. Yeah. D Well, we had a pretty, we bought our Chevrolet brand new C and then we bought a used car <baby_talking>. <<Talks to baby>> Just a minute, I'll change your diaper. Then we bought our, our next car used C and, F uh, we had better luck with our used car, C and I like it more. It cost us less money C and we got more features and airconditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money. If you can find one that's r, F uh, D you know, reliable <baby_talking>. If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from <noise> C or, <baby_talking> D you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough <child_talking> <breathing>. F Uh, I wouldn't <baby_crying>. <Child_talking>. <Child_talking>. <<Very faint>> Uhhuh. Sh, Yeah. That's, we bought one like that. Uhhuh <baby_crying>. We bought one car that way C and had, we bought it real reasonably C and it was in real nice condition so, because apparently whatever the bank get... Oh <laughter>. I, right now my car is terminally ill C so I am really looking at, F uh, facing the purchase of a car. C And, F uh, what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that, I won't do it. C But <laughter>, F Uh, D well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible. C And, F uh, D you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me C so I don't know why I think I want one C but I do. F Uh, I will probably stay with a foreign make. I've had real good luck with them. Is that right? F Oh, D well, I didn't realize it. I knew that one of the, that Nissan which is Toyota had, F uh, joined with, had a plant over here. C And, C and I, didn't know if it was General Motors or who, C but I, I never thought of, I know, F uh, you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A Huh. D Well, yeah, C and that's minimum. It, D you know it's, it's a major purchase, now. What we used to pay for homes is now what a car, can cost. <Cough>. If they held their value, that would be one thing. C But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot, they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated. C And, D you know, that, <sigh> I don't know that, I'll go with, I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought C and I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again. <Laughter>. D Well, I'm, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car. D Well, some people, D you know, some people have to have a new car every year. Or it, D you know, at the most every two years C and they don't drive them that much. Especially, your foreign cars. D You know, like a Honda or, F uh, a Toyota. Six thousand is just getting broken in for them. C And if I can find one or a repossession. C And with the banks being in such financial, D you know, problems now that people, you can find the banks willing to sell you a car.
