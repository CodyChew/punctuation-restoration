Yeah, D so, F uh, what are your favorite T V shows? F Oh, I haven't watched that very much, is that, do you like that? When was that on? On A B C? F Oh, F oh, yeah, D well, F um, F um, it may be that, F um, it was recently replaced, by actually by, F um, by what may be my favorite T V show of, because sort of, F uh, F um, TWIN PEAKS. Yeah, C so, TWIN PEAKS, F um, what happened was, I think, TWIN PEAKS, F um, went, went off, they moved to a Saturday night for a while. And then put, and then put something, I guess, GABRIEL'S FIRE on it, and at Thursday nights, C and then they moved, F um, no, GABRIEL'S FIRE was on C B S, I think, I, I take that back. I'm not sure, C but anyway they moved it back and forth C and that's when PEAKS was back in that time slot as well. C So, I don't know. No, I have no idea. I don't think, I don't think that was on A B C, anyway I don't know what happened to it though. <Laughter>. F Um, it's hard to say <laughter> I'm sort of a very big TWIN PEAKS fan, C and beyond that I just sort of watch anything that happens to be on. I'm, I'm, half the time I'm a T V addict C and the other half the time I just ignore it <laughter> it's really bad. Yeah, there's some new shows that I sort of like, F um, have you seen this SHANNON FIELD SHOW C or, F uh, it's about a lawyer, it's one of these lawyer shows, D you know, they seem to be popular these days. C And there's a lot of those Blair shows floating around. Yeah. I just D like I just finished watching that a few minutes ago, <laughter>. F Um, C and it C and, that, that's a interesting one. I, I, I like that, because there's, there are, I've noticed that every, every major station now has their own law show. There's L A LAW, C and there's, F um, EQUAL JUSTICE, some other one, LAW AND ORDER or something. Lots of, lots of these things that are floating around now. They seem to be popular shows. Do you like the law shows C or, That, that makes logic, also saves a lot of time with commercials. F Oh, I have. I've, I've, I watched that late, F um, I guess it's on late Saturday nights or something, that's entering the day as well. Have you, have, have you seen this often? F Oh, really? Yeah. Really? I don't know that. I, That don't, it, it, it seems like, E I mean, if wrestling is prime time, professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a wrestling to me, I don't, I don't see any difference though, I, I don't understand it, they consider it violent. I have so ever, I have seen it on, where we are, I live in, F uh, Rochester, New York, C and I think a, Yes. Where are you? You're, F uh, everybody I speak to is in Texas, F oh, F oh, yeah, C but I'm, I'm in New York C and, F uh, we seem, we seem to have, F um, I think the AMERICAN GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well, sometimes. I think it's been on, I think I've seen it during the day. I know I've seen it during the day in Florida. When I was at my parents down there. Definitely seen it do, on, on, during the day down there, C and I don't think it's a very violent show, I think it's funny. I think it's a real good concept, I think it's something completely new. <Laughter>. D Well, Yeah, I think so, I think because people sort of get through, D you know, F um, I think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the, as well as, D you know, some mental fitness C and I think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth. D Well, don't they take people who have some sort of, F um, big abilities like C and, C and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones I saw they had, F um, a man on who was, F uh, he played college football and almost went pro, C and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate C and she was the, F uh, she was in the junior Olympics or something C or they seem to have people who have very, very big sports backgrounds. To have they, le, leaned away from that sort of, F Oh, that's how they do it. Really? <Laughter>. Yeah, okay, I just thought they had some, yeah, I thought they had some sort of, E I mean, I thought they were just poor people like us I guess not, that's great. C But, maybe I'll try it one day. <Laughter> I'll get on there one day and see if I can, F uh, F um, what, what do they win, they, they win money I think, don't they? Really? Wow. All that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour. <Laughter>. One little ball here and there, yeah, C and this guy's beating you up, C so, I don't know the beating up part. I, I D actually feel the tennis balls would hurt. They look like, Yeah, they seem like a tennis ball C but it almost doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah, the best I, I don't think I could, I, I could handle those tennis balls. C So, what else to you tape besides AMERICAN GLAD, at, there anything else? Huh? Okay. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. <Laughter> C But, I'm sure that's fun. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay, D well, they seem to be on later, all, always right, right before the news is when I catch them. I, I tend to, if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news, and or, or NIGHTLINE or something, just sort of get a good, D you know, a good, a good think for the day. Yes. When is yours on? F Oh, gosh, D well, I'm sorry I interrupted, F um, Yeah, ours is on, D actually it, ours is on at eleven it, it's, F um, eleven o'clock now here or eleven twentyfive now here in New York. F Um, I think they wo, they do that, I think they put things on at, F um, eleven o'clock here C and I think they put it like eleven o'clock, F um, California time, D like in California C but in the middle they sort of, F um, D like central time or mountain time they, they push things back. C So, I was D actually, D actually I'm not sure , I was in, I was in Iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier, C so, does your prime time start at seven o'clock? Wait, no, no, not, not even the news C but do they have D like, F um, do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth, start at seven o'clock? You, C so, D like, D you know, the regular television shows that are, that are very popular, do they start at, seven or, or at eight? Right, C because that would the eight o'clock here. Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, F um, that would all start at, at eight o'clock here, that wouldn't start at seven. We have, F um, at seven o'clock we just have, F um, the, they'll play, D you know, they have old reruns of CHEERS or something from seven to seven thirty, and then something else from seven thirty to eight C but then at, at eight o'clock is when everything starts. Which is, which is strange, E I mean, because yours start at seven and end to ten C and ours start at, at, at, at eight and end at eleven, that's why we . I, I would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten. F Oh, that's great. F Oh, all the time. Do you watch CHEERS C or, There's, there's, it's at, that was actually a big dilemma for me now because, F um, CHEERS, CHEERS and TWIN PEAKS are now on the same time, One that I can't find anymore which is GABRIEL'S FIRE. Yes. It was usually on, F um, Thursday nights. I don't know <laughter>. It was same time period, yes. You don't know what happened to GABRIEL'S FIRE then? I don't remember one, from one station to another. I keep forgetting one station. What's your second favorite? F Oh, is he the reformed, F um, gambler? Yes, yes, yes. I really don't watch that much T V, what I do is I tape the programs I want to watch, C and then on the nights I can watch, I'll pick out something. C But, F um, <Laughter> you're not kidding. Do you ever watch AMERICAN GLADIATORS? Midnight. Midnight. I tape it. Yeah, I tape it because I don't stay up that late to watch it, I tape it. C But I understand, F uh, that in England, they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent, C and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program. C And, I'm like, I don't believe this. I don't either. You're in New York? Oh. I'm in Dallas, Texas. F Oh, really? Oh. I think it's great. I love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else, C and competition. I'm going F oh, great, D you know, it's a, it's a great role model for everybody. F Oh, yes, E I mean, when I had, F uh, I was watching it, the, first time I ever saw a microbiologist on there I thought D well, it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities. C And, F uh, there she was terrific, she was really terrific. They hold competitions in Los Angeles in, F um, Florida and Minneapolis, Minnea, F um, trying to think of, I think it's in four places around the United States. They hold competition C and the only requirement is, of course, your skill of passing these tests, C and that's it. C And we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made it. There is a woman that, F uh, made, D well, she called herself a craft person C so, I'm not quite sure what she made. C And, F uh, she made it. E I mean there is no, your occupation has nothing to do with it. Strictly your skill. Huhuh. <Laughter>. I think the last I heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's, D you know, just minor. Just minor little ball here or there, D you know. F Oh, D well, they, they come out with a lot of bruises too. Hey, D see I tape MURDER SHE WROTE. I like mysteries. I like mysteries. I tape, F um, FATHER DOWLING, because that's another mystery, C and I don't have to concentrate too hard on them. F Um, most of the lawyer programs like, F uh, LAW AND ORDER, they're not on the times that I've got, that I've watched because I haven't had T got, T V GUIDE around here in ages. Yeah. Your news is on at eleven? Ten, I was just in the middle of watching it. F Oh, that's okay. No problem. No, D well, they have it at six C and they have it at nine, C and they have one at ten. I'm trying to think. Both, F um, let's see they start, F um, EVENING SHADE at seven C and then it goes to, F um, what is it after EVENING, F um, that's MAJOR DAD at eight I think it is. Huh. Yeah, it's, it's stopped around here at ten C and it goes into night programs, at that point which could be one of, D you know, many different night programs C but it goes into night programs. C But, F uh, do you ever watch CHEERS? <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah, F oh, yeah.
