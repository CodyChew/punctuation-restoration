Okay. What do you think of the public school system? First off, do you have children that are in it? F Oh, okay <laughter>. D Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now. I now have grandchildren, in the school system C so, F uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now, with it. C So what do you think? Right. <Laughter> That's right <laughter>. Right. Yes, it is. I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, we have a, F uh, fourth grader C and then we have one that's in kindergarten C and, C and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade. D You know, it's amazing, to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high. which, of course, shows my age. <Laughter>. Is that scary? <Laughter>. Right. D Now, Yes. <Laughter> Correct. Are you finding that, F uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do fulltime? F Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms. C And, C and d, are you, do you find that? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Be, uhhuh. <Laughter>. Coming up, uhhuh. Right <laughter>. D Well, I, I know that this again this, this friend, F uh, is in the Plano School District, C and she teaches, F uh, F uh, it mus, F uh, emotionally disturbed children. C And she says she has, F um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade. C And, she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready. C But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something. I didn't quite understand it. C And, F uh, I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems C and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a fulltime job in the public school, system <sniffing>. C So, Oh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job. I think they have a long way to go yet C but I think that, F um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier. You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers, C and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done. C And I think that, F uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, D you know, skills. D You know, you don't just add one plus one you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together. C And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think, they literally cannot come in out of the rain. D You know, C and that just, I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot <laughter> make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted. C And, F uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education. C So I think, D you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have, C and I think that's very, very important. F Oh, yeah. <Sniffing>. F Oh, yeah. I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade C and her prealgebra book is higher then <laughter> some of my Algebra Two, when I was in high school. C And it's like, F oh, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you. D You know, C so they're really, they're really moving them along C but yet, <sniffing> at the same time, D you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life. C And that's wha, D you know, a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use. C And, F uh, C so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, D you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this. Yes, that's a, <Sniffing> D Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, F uh, statewide and national wide testing, things so that they compare C and. D You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say. C And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it. C And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be, D you know, that I think it's, F uh, I think it's crazy personally <laughter>. D You know, the fir, the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review C but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in, October. So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States. C And I think that's totally useless. I think, D you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons C but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous. It's like bragging on your grandchildren. D You know, C and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth C and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this, C and that's great. C But that's what they're doing with the school systems C and they're wasting too much time on that, I think. <Sniffing>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes. <Sniffing>. Yeah, there's a, yeah. The bottom line is always money,
