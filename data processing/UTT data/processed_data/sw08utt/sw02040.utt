Yes, F um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico. D Well, I'm, I guess I don't have su, such close experience with, with, F um, an area becoming a state as you do. F Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta, F uh, standard of living or at least, F um, annual average income. F Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need. However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo. I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting. I did Peace Corps training there. C And so, F um, D you know, I saw it, also as a young student C and, C and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California C and so the Spanish was no problem. F Um, it was, it was, D you know, very lovely C and, C and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice. I have, D actually, I work with, F uh, a girl from Puerto Rico C and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, F um. D Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. F Um, D you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing. I've live abro, abroad most of my life, C so, I guess I, I've been very cut off. I lived actually in Lebanon, C so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, D you know, and be, was becoming an adult. C So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, F uh, a new state that is so very, very poor. F Um, I guess, D you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of D like New York and, and how much aid it needs. I suppose the whole country, E or the whole, F um, new state would require such aid. I think so. Uhhuh. Yeah, those, are good points, F um, which obviously I had never thought about. F Uh, I don't know, F uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, F um, ways of life than they would if, if, I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory. Perhaps compulsory education. F Um, and taxes <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, D well D actually I thin, one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway. C So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me C either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, C or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage. I, I believe I would probably tend towards that. D Well that's interesting. Right. What about if, if, F um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, F um, I was in bilingual education in California C and I didn't have any problem with my students C but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school C and he can't speak a word. C And so, obviously it didn't work in California. Right. Right. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Okay, D well thank you very much. Bye, bye. I was a resident, although very young of the sta, of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fiftynine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state. F Uh, C so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico. F Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, F uh, C and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought C either to make it a fullfledged state C or, C or let it go, one or the other. What is your situation? F Oh that's very interesting. Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid C or, Uhhuh. I guess, F um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than D say Mississippi C or, Okay, that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess. Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. F Um, I don't know whether state woul, statehood would improve their economy. I don't, I don't know that the ve, the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them. F Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now. C But of course if their economy is weak the, there is not much of a base on which to tax. I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be. How do you feel, though, about, D well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory, C but, F um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student C and my parents were in the military at the time C so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee. I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se, feeling of second class citizenry, F uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote. The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative. Uhhuh. F Uh, I see what you mean, C so that, Yeah, taxes would undoubtedly be occurring. F Uh, there, I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation. F Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states, I, C and I'm thinking in terms of education. C But then again each state sets its own C and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico. F Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, F uh, economy, F uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, F uh, realization C and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, D gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country C so, Uhhuh, D well that's interesting too. D Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, F uh, status quo. C And I think, F uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these. C So I'm ul, I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood. I think I would be troubled, I suspect, I believe that any of our states, C and I, constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions abo, against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something. F Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions. I would be bothered by that. I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths C and that's the, the, the melting pot. F Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines, C but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past C and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country. C And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever. F Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make C and I think that that they would need to reassess that. F Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, F uh, in so far that it intr, it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect. F Um. Yeah, C but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual, C and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language. C But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level. F Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess. D Well I think we have gone to time C and I appreciate your having called. Goodbye.
