Okay. D Well what movie have you seen? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It's one of my favorite even, Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. A whole lot, uhhuh kind of dark, uhhuh. <Laughter> Good. D Well, how, is he young? Yeah, okay, that makes sense. D Well, my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE. They, F uh, D well we do, too, C but they just want to rent that one. That is their very favorite. They think they're so cute. I guess <laughter> so, I guess so, I guess so. We're not real big movie goers ourselves, C but we did try to go see about a month ago that, F um, DEAD AGAIN that black and white one, C and I was not real impressed with it. In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean, wait, wait run that back, C and we couldn't run it back uhhuh. C But we, we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end, C and we thought we were being very quiet, this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later. C And I'm sorry <laughter>. We're just not real big movie goers. Yeah. D Well, that's us too that's us too. Yeah, I thought that was cute, too. C And my husband's name is Bob C and he wants to see that yeah, he wanted to see that. I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, F uh, that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking C and I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that. The little guy is so cute, C and he's terribly rich by now. <Laughter> Yeah, me too <laughter>. F Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. Uhhuh. AWAKENING, is supposed to be wonderful. Yeah, AWAKENING is supposed to be wonderful my mom saw that C and she said that was an excellent movie. Yes. Yes. I think that's supposed to be good, C and I, F uh, we have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, dear. Uhhuh. D Well, on, F uh, back to your movie you saw that ten thousand, F uh, HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS F um, did you all ever think about purchasing that one, when it comes out? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I understand that, too, I understand that, too. D Now they had uhhuh, they had HOME ALONE offered for like, I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars C and I thought D well, D now that's, that's close enough to being several, D you know, you could rent it more than onc, more than four times and watch that. D Well, I under, I understand I understand, F Oh, yeah, of course. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, sweet <laughter>. <Laughter> C But that's, in her plans. D Well, it's hard, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids C and even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know, we rented ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING thinking that would be so cute, C and it's a precious movie, C but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in, Uhhuh. D Well, you watch, it differently when your kids are in the room, D you know C and I was just sitting there going, F Oh, my goodness, C and I'm going to have to stop and explain, C and they go, I know, Mommy, I know. Uhhuh, yeah, it's, it's a little different, because you see things from a different different angle. F Uh, we rented, this summer before we went on vacation, we rented Chevy Chase and that FAMILY VACATION. C And those are just absolutely hilarious C but you just really can't watch a lot of that. We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it <laughter>. I think the last one that we actually went to go see, D well, there's two. I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS of course they wanted to see it. They had the Disney book C and they thought that was wonderful C and they loved the dogs, C and so yes, we went with some friends of ours, C and I was a little worried about my son. He's about two and a half C and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them C and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, D you know, that the, the, the puppies are missing C and it shows the town, C and you can hear all the barking, C but you can't see the dogs <laughter>. Yeah, C so that kind of bothered him C but after that he did fine. Yeah, he'll be three in January. Yeah. I loved that movie. <Laughter>. Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do, right <laughter>. Yeah. Wasn't that good. F Oh, no. D Well, I like to watch the movies, C but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video C and we rent them C and now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie C and that was just hilarious, I died. C And we, we did also, we went to see WHAT ABOUT BOB one night, which is a funny, funny movie it's a funny movie. That's true. <Laughter> I hope he stays cute <Laughter> not spoiled, D you know, you get to where the money goes to their heads or goes to something, D you know, they grow up too fast, C so. C But, F uh, there's a lot I want to see, D you know, what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out in video. D You know, I'd like to see GREEN CARD, I want to see AWAKENING. F Uh, I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Yeah. C And D see, I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY, D you know, the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good, I'd like to see that. I've heard that's good, yeah. C So I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out. My kids want to see RESCUER'S DOWN UNDER C so I'm going to ha, my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago, C so I'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies, their little, D you know, Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff C and, Yeah. D You know, I look at those, D like CINDERELLA came out was for sale, C and, I don't buy them, I, now I will copy them and rent them and keep them at home C but I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar <laughter>. D You know, they don't last that long. F Oh, that's pretty good, Yeah. Yeah. That, that makes it worth it, F uh, C but, a lot of the Disney movies, it's just too expensive, C and I can rent them C or I can make a copy D you know, my daughter's in love with the LITTLE MERMAID C and I have a copy that's just about worn out. She's four C so she just thinks the grou, in fact she told me, Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial. D Now, I'm not pregnant, mind you, C but this is, she's planning ahead, Yeah, Yeah. F Oh, I know. D Now, D see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie, C but it's been so long since I watched it, I don't remember the language. Was it bad? D Well, that's true. F Oh, C and D see my kids weren't in the roo, you're right, I watched it without them. Huh. Huh. Yes. Yes. Yes <laughter>. Some of it just isn't,
