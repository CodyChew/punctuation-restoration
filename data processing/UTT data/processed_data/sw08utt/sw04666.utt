I imagine you can't escape it <laughter>. D Well, of course, it was fun for you <laughter>. To? F Oh, really. I was born and raised in, F uh, near Miami and, F uh, spent the last twenty years in Dallas F uh, where the Rangers played. C And, F uh, for the last, F uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A s and the San Francisco Giants. F Uh, C but honestly, D you know, I, F uh, I do my duty and watch the sports on, F uh, the newscasts C but that's about all the exposure I have to sports. Uhhuh <noise> <<sounds like a train>>. F Oh, yeah, sure. D Well, I guess the, F uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A s were D like the leading teams a couple of years ago. D Well, I th, D well I don't know. That's sort of what I gather. F Um, C and, F uh, I don't know. What is the prognosis for, F uh, this year? Good. I, I assume that means good for the Minnesota <noise>, <Laughter>. <Static>. Yep <static>. I think a train went by. I know a train went by, I don't know what the noise was C but I think it probably was the, the train. D Well, I don't know. I, I, I don't even know, F uh, who has been winning in, F uh, as far as the, F uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A s C but I think they both won their opener. I, F uh, sort of gathered that in my, F uh, subliminal memory. Huh. Uhhuh. I guess they are different leagues. Is that right? The A s? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Eightysix? Huh! D Well they must play every day then. I mean eightysix times two is a hundred sixty. C And that's, D Lord, that's, F uh, over five months worth. Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth. No. That was the Super Bowl. I don't feel so bad. I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball <laughter>. <Sigh>. I see, okay. F Oh, really, okay. D Well, I, I know, F uh, the Super Bowl, D Actually, I'm in, like I said, I'm in Minneapolis C and the big thing up here, of course, is the twins. F Uh, No, it's, it's pretty pervasive. It kind of goes <laughter> into about all aspects of society I think up here. C But, F uh, D actually, I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year, C but that was a lot of fun. <Laughter> D Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis. In fact, I've only been up here a few months C and I'm going back at the end of next month. F Uh, Orlando, Florida. C So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything. C But, F Oh, yeah. Oh. Uhhuh. . Right. <Laughter>. F Oh, okay. Yeah, I haven't followed it real closely at all. F Uh, except like I said, last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that pretty religiously. Went out into the bars, D you know drank a beer, watched the game, had a gir, a good time that way. C But, F uh, Is that right? Uhhuh. F Uh, real good as far as I can tell. People are pretty excited about it. D Well yeah <laughter>. Sorry about that, yeah. F Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good. F Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago C and they, they won that one seven to one, C so, F uh, that's pretty good I guess. It looks like they'll be doing pretty well. Are you still there? Okay. I heard some noise on the line. Didn't know what happened. F Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. Uhhuh <laughter>. D Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, F uh, for their season coming up. I've D actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now. F Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, F uh, an internship. We, we're both doctoral students C and he's doing his with I B M C and I'm doing mine with Honeywell. C But, F uh, I, I think he kind of follows the sports C and I think he's mentioned <noise> F uh, the Oakland A s a couple of times. F Uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good. As far as I know, yeah. C And in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions C and then, of course, there's the minors. F Uh, I don't know. I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball. F Uh, C but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game, C and he offered, D you know, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought, F uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, E or a row of seats D actually, for the home games. C But the thing is, there's like eightysix home games per year. C So there's no, no way that you can ever use them all. Eightysix. I was amazed to hear that. D You know, that's just the home games C and I, I thought it was a mistake C but he goes no. Yeah. Well just about, yeah. Yeah. C And that's, D you know, yeah that's almost, That's a lot of baseball. D Well, you, yo, if you, if you consider it, the season starts, D well it's, the season started about a week and a half ago C and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January. Yeah, I think so. It did last we, year, didn't it? C Or was it November? Maybe it was November I'm thinking about. I know it was doggone cold up here. F Uh, D Well, I know for sure it was, I know it was after September. Because that's when I got up here. C And, C and it was at least two months after I got up here. Yeah, C so it had to be November anyway.
