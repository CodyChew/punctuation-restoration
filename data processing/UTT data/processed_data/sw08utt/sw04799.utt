<Breathing> Okay. F Uh, I haven't been in this situation yet <laughter>. D You know, my, my parents are not quite at that age yet, C so I haven't, No. C So I haven't, F uh, really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother C but, F uh <Children> C but that's really about it. How about you? Have you been in that situation yet? <Noise> <<sounds like kitchen noises like water and pots and pans>> <static>. Uhhuh. Did it D really? Yeah. F Oh, no. That's sad. Yeah. F Oh, okay. I'm sure they were. Yeah. Uhhuh. Ah. Yeah. Oh. F Um. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And I'm sure it's, it's expensive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My, my grandmother is not in a nursing home C but she's in a <Lipsmack> F oh they're like, F uh, they're apartments for senior citizens C and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long C and then they have, F uh, where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go C and she, she, she really does love that C but she's just concerned about i, in the future, D you know. That, she, she knows it's not going to be like that all the time. C And she's just wondering D well what's going to happen to me C and, C and I, D you know, it's, I guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that, C but D you know she's kind of asking questions about what, D well what's going to happen, this can't last forever C and so. Yeah. Yeah, she can C but I, I think it is also cafeteria style. Because I, I D really, I, I, I doubt if she rarely cooks for herself. C So, F uh because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat, C so I'm assuming it's something like that too. C So. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. C And she lives by herself too. She seems to like it. C And, F uh, my husband's grandmother is, D well, she lives, she lives in a house on her own C and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that C but, she has her own home C and sh, she's doing really well. I'm really proud of her. She's doing really well, C so we haven't had to do anything, C but then again, she has a lot of support C so E I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that C so. Hopefully, we won't need to go that route <door>. Yeah <children> <noise> <breathing>. <TV> <talking> <child> They're not quite elderly, F huh <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Uh, not for my parents. C But I, I was around, F uh, two sets of grandparents, F uh, quite a bit, we, we put one, I put one grandfather in a rest home C and that killed him <laughter>. D Well, yeah, kind of. D Well, there was some other things involved C but it, before he was really active C and the, there was some, D you know, he lost his drivers license C and I couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things C and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home. C And he just kind of became a vegetable and died. C So C but that was a long time ago. That was, F uh, back in like seventythree. C So, F uh, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then. C And, F uh, my grandmother, his, his wife F uh, we also put her in a rest home. She was in a rest home C and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there <noise> C and, F uh, had a physical, had a good physical therapist at that place C and they worked with her and got her walking and got her ta, kind of taking care of herself C and so she was able to come back home C and then she had to go back in a couple of times, C but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up. C And they got her going again. C So I guess as far as looking, I said as what you're looking for, I think you need to look for an active, F uh, an <talking> interactive staff. Somebody who is willing to work with, F uh, D you know, work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them, treat like they're, It, it is <laughter>. It is expensive. <Noise> Uhhuh. F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. When she can't take care of herself. Uhhuh. D Now <noise>, Uhhuh. Does she have a, is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to C or she can go down to the cafeteria? Uhhuh. In fact, I, Uhhuh. Yeah, I, I really like that concept. They've, they have a few of those, D well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah C and, D you know, couples can, D you know, husband and wife can, can live there too or, or whatever. I, C and, C and then, C and yet they have their, their friendships and relationships and the, <coughing> <<child in background>> D you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that. I, I think it really takes, F uh, D you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yes. D Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, D you know, a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like that, D you know, they say putting them out to pasture C and some, some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active. They, they wanted to do things. They didn't, D you know, they didn't want to go down and play bingo or, F uh, D you know, play with the oranges <TV> <talking> <child>,
