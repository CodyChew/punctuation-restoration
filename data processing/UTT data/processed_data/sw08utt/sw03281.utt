Okay, Diane. C And a very good afternoon to you. Do you, F uh, do most of your cooking at home C or do you, F uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them? Uhhuh. My goodness <laughter>. D Well, what would you, F uh, like to cook? What's, what, what's, what is your favorite, F uh, recipes, F uh, that you would like to have for a dinner party? D Now you're in Dallas, is it? Okay. I was, I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost, Tex, TexMex. Uhhuh. D Well, that's a very interesting food though C and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find. We have, F uh, I think som, Chico's C or, C or in these different restaurants in this area that, F uh, have all this fine Mexican foods. C But, F um, if I were to cook, F uh, a dinner party, F uh, it may be standard to you C but, F uh, D actually I never get too much fried chicken. C But I would have fried chicken, F uh, with reasonably hot sauce on it. Almost a Mexican type thing. C And I love twice cooked potatoes. Have you ever had twice cooked potatoes? With, with a cream made of the, the sour cream and cream cheese and, F uh, a little oleo and I use, F uh, oregano and maybe dill weed, F uh, mixed in with it. C And, F uh, I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers. As you can see, I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal <laughter>. C And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too. C So, F uh, how would you improve upon that? More fresh vegetables? Included to that? Uhhuh. How do you cook your green beans? Uhhuh. C So you h, All right that's what I was wondering about. What, what you use and, and in herbs and so forth. Uhhuh. Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans? We use soy sauce, D Well, you might, F uh, be interested in that. Have, it gives a very delicious taste. You, you have a soy sauce taste C and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the, F uh, water and, F uh, <lipsmack> D golly. What's this white powder that, that, F uh, that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce? I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment. D Anyhow <laughter>, sorry about my mind. C But, F uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans C and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it. If it does it, it brings out such a, so much different things in, F uh in the string beans. I, I like it to try them differently. I hardly ever cook them the same way twice. Just so I can enjoy them. C So you might, F uh, think about that. Chinese cooking D actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them. C And, F uh, north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous. C And that's, F uh, made from, F uh, I think they call it, beans. C And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, F uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish. You probably have to buy that from specialty stores. C o u s, c o u s. C And that's a, a north African dish. They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa. C And it is very very flexible. You can do a lot of things with it. It makes a fantastic, F uh, F uh, salad with cucumbers and, olive oil and onions C and, F Oh, boy, real tasty. D Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, C and I hope I've given you some ideas C and, F uh, that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food. <Laughter> D Well, thank you very much Miss Diane. Byebye. C And aft, good afternoon to you. <Throat_clearing> F Um, no. I do most of my cooking at home C and, F um, I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner party. <Laughter>. F Um, Right, I'm in Dallas. Of course, F um, dinner parties down here probably, F oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues <laughter>. C And, Uhhuh, yes. Yeah, F uh, TexMex, F uh, Mexican food, F um probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Fried chicken. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, yes, I have. Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, <gasp> improve upon that? Let's see. I'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in. C And some, Yeah. F Uh, green beans and, F uh carrots and things like that. My green beans? F Um, I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes. C And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them. Uhhuh. Right, uhhuh. F Um, I like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there. C And it makes them pretty tasty. The Chinese type. Are they the real, No, I haven't ever used that. Uhhuh. A white powder. F Um, gosh. <Laughter>. That's okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I might try that. F Oh, yes. I love Chinese. North African? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. D Well, I've enjoyed talking with you. F Oh, yes. Okay, thank you. Byebye.
