Okay. I hope you know more about the subject of baseball C and where they're going <laughter> than I do beca, D Well, I, of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best. However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years, C but I have kept, F uh, my eye on the Rangers. D You know C and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point, C and then they kind of fell on their face <laughter>. Correct, right. They've got a one man show going there. <Laughter> Which is interesting, D you know. F Um, I guess he can, I guess he can really call down a salary <laughter>. They're so astronomical I can't even imagine <Laughter> that kind of money. You know it's just, F uh, phenomenal <lipsmack>. D Well, good. I understand. I understand. Okay. F Uh, you are involved with T I s, F uh, speech, F um, recognition? How did you find out about it? F Oh, okay. I see. Interesting. F Oh, great. I see. Uhhuh. D Well, that's good. D Well, that's interesting. C And the topics are interesting, F uh, they run a whole gamut of, of, F uh, subjects, C and, F uh, I think we can address every topic, C but the depth of knowledge is quite different. C So, F uh, when they chose baseball, E I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand baseball, D you know, I don't understand football. F Um, D you know, F uh, it's such a rugged game that it, F uh, F uh, it seems to be too physical for my, F uh, interest <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball. C But I can't relate to football because I've never, played football and, and don't, and have any interest, C and I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football. C And, F uh, I had four daughters <laughter> C so that wasn't a question, C but now I have a grandson that i, D you know, is gung ho for, F uh, football. C And, F uh, that doesn't please Grandma too much. I'm always af, because the injuries are, F uh, can be very, very devastating. I understand that, C but I think the, they happen more in football. I think the odds are cut down. D You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too. The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage C but, F uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball. Because the, Yeah. A love for them. Uhhuh. I see. Uhhuh. Did you, did you sustain any permanent, F uh, injury with that? Oh. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, boy. Uhhuh. D Well, I have, F uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three. It was never set right. C And, F uh, F uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport. C And, F uh, one of the men that was in our rel, on our league, F uh, noticed, F uh, D you know, F uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do. C And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage. C And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eightyseven. <Laughter> C So, F uh, yeah <throat_clearing>. F Um, it was really funny, D you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, F uh, follow through with my, F uh, addressing that, to put the ball, the, F uh, pins. C So that was interesting. C So I really, F um, I got a lot of, F uh, recognition from the, F uh, F uh, the bowling league, I guess. I'm not sure where all my pins came from, C but it's, C but that was quite awhile ago C but I, C and I never pursued it. C And a lot of people said, D well, you should have turned pro. C And I thought, no, not m, m, I don't, my love wasn't there for the game. I liked to as a, as a method of, F uh, entertainment and I, F uh, fellowship C but outside of that, no. I didn't. C And I, C and I still, I like to bowl, C but, F uh, <lipsmack> I don't have, F uh, Jack <laughter> standing behind me to tell me what to do <laughter>. No, I'm not. No. No, F uh, at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement C and, F uh, it's true bowling C and I've never, F uh, shared that with them. I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, F uh, win a lot of money for the junior achievement, F uh, organization. C But that's the only thing that I would, D you know, be to do. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Still carries a good lim, F uh, average? F Oh, I know a little bit about it. I'm not a diehard fan C but I, I enjoy the, I like the Boston Red Sox myself. Uhhuh. D Well, with, F uh, their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately, C so. Right <laughter>. F Oh, it's amazing. Right. D Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well. F Um, I've been really busy at work this past week C and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper C and, F uh, i, C so every day I'll have a newspaper at work, C and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper. C But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop <laughter>. C But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine. D Well, not really. I, F um I work at laboratory. From, F uh, I'm an officer in the Air Force, C and, F uh, they have a speech lab across the hall from us. C And, F uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, F uh, T I, at, F uh, not in my office C but, F uh, in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work. Sure. Sure. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, I prefer to, I, I like, I never used to really like watching football that much C but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game, C but I've always liked baseball. I, I prefer to watch, F um, I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football. C And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, D Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport. I'd, I, Uhhuh. F Uh, baseball, it's true. I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less, troublesome sports, C but, F uh, for some people it's just, F uh, F uh, D Well, that, not so much that C but, F uh, even in baseball you can, D like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, F uh, F uh, just throwing the ball because I wa, very, I was always very strong C and I could, th, when I was young I could throw harder, than my, F uh, D like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to. C And so I was always throwing my arm out and, F uh, having trouble. I, C and I was a catcher C so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and k, that kind of stuff. C So I, that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing, C so. No, I did that wrestling <laughter>. No, I'd, D well, I, I, F uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things C and, F um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me. C But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like, now I won't play football anymore because of the, F uh, the separated shoulder wrestling, C so. F Um, C but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling, C but it, as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me then playing football this fall, I, A it was just flag football too. I separated it again C and it seemed to be, D like the straw that broke the camels back, C so. Uhhuh. My God. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. Are you on, you on any leagues now? Oh. Uhhuh. Right. D Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years. I don't know, a long time. C And she still, she's got to be, D Well, no, she does,
