All right, Carolyn, When do you, are you reading the papers about the, the Middle East summit? Yes. I'm just a little bit too. I think, F um, I think I was worn o, worn out from Middle East after the war. Uhhuh. <Lipsmack> Yeah, yeah. Wha, That's I think, F uh, I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back. I think that's really, F uh, really important. I, I, I, I guess we grew up in such a different world I could never even imagine taking hostages. C But I think they just have a whole different world than we do C so, <lipsmack> I don't know. C But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, I think, F um, I don't know I have, F uh, I just have this, this civil rights mentality I, I guess. You know should we C or, C or D you know, sho, should we, F uh, those, I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do. I guess that's what I, I hope for them. C But some of them don't want those freedoms I think. Their, their religious beliefs may, F um, may not, D you know, they may not want it as a whole C so I think that's something that has to be considered too. C But I think that's a, that's really a long term type thing. I know that the, the, it said think about long term repercussions C and I was just thinking, D well, peace is peace D you know, C and that really is the nicest thing. Uhhuh, yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah. I, I think so. I think, F um, C And, Right. I think, I think they realized we would probably never push him out C and, F uh, I think the other, probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out. Uhhuh. Yeah, yep. Uhhuh. Yeah. I, I think the, the thing is though I, I guess the, the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any i, ideas that, that coincide with the, the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union. C And I guess that's all gone. I think that's really, F uh, probably what started the whole process. <Laughter> I, Yeah. I think, I think that they're s, they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union C so I guess they're saying, D well, D you know, we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways. We can C either act like we're going to be procommunist C or act like we're going to be pro, F uh, prodemocracy C and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do, C but we really won't change in the long run. I think that's the way I sort of see them all working, D you know. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. It's, it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis. I always find it very hard in my heart to a, to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs, <lipsmack> D you know. C But then again they have to live in that environment. They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings, and terrorist attacks and whatever. Then they have to negotiate almost everything C and then you think to yourself, D well, D you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else, C but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in, then you have to sort of D like, I don't know, logically, F Uh, some. Yeah. I think it kind of, F uh, it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did I think during the war. C But, F um, we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Yeah. <Lipsmack> F Oh, <noise> D well, D you know, I just see this Middle East situation with, with Russia and everything there that's happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down, C and I see the Middle East as being, D you know the real <noise> hot spot of the future so to speak. C So, I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to negotiate, trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. I guess the question in my mind somewhat C and, C and it depends on the country, D you know, I think some are more peaceful than others. If you look at, F um, Iraq for example and D you know the recent thing with the U N going in there and the, the bomb development and all this kind of stuff, D you know. Gosh. I think, D you know, we should have got him while we <laughter> could or whatever. C And I think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East, D you know, the, the constant fighting, D you know C and, Yeah, I think they, they look at force as a way of D you know, their, their means to their ends. C And, F uh, C so I, D you know, I don't know so much if these peace talks are going to, I don't know how much they'll stay to them. D You know, if, if we, even if we say that we're going to do stuff, I don't know how they'll stick to that <noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that's probably a bonus on our part. Yes, it is. Uhhuh. Yeah. I tend to agree with you. D You know, I think they have in mind what they want to do C and I think a lot of times their might make right. C And, D you know it, kind of the forceful, D you know, I don't know. C But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds <laughter>. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Yeah.
