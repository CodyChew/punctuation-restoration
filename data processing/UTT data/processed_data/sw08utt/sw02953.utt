D Well, what kind of music did you all listen to? <Buzz>. Uhhuh. No, D now, D well then you was, in the, F uh, C or, I am sorry, I am going to make you sound like you're eighty something. Okay, Woodstock. What was, yeah, what was you doing during Woodstock? Uhhuh. You would have had a ball. I, I kind of liked, would have liked to have been there. Yeah. <Laughter> Don't you wish you had been able to, though? F Oh, that would have been such a great memory. Yeah. Yeah. You went and planted a tree or something? Uhhuh. D Well, D well, growing up with, <child_talking> when I grew up, it just was not, we did not have any causes. To me it didn't, doesn't seem like we have got much, you know what I mean? Yeah. D Well, I do remember demonstrations over busing. Yeah. Yeah <<faintly>>. Yeah. D Well, right. By the time I was born, even now, D you know, women's rights, F uh, we just, we are totally equal now. There is not really a lot to fight over. D Now I saw something on T V last night on TWENTYTWENTY. D You know, men's, F uh, fathers or daddies, D now wait a minute, Daddies Are People Too. It is about a lot of men, D you know, all right, going through divorces. The judge will usually, F uh, give custody to the mother ninetyseven percent of the time. Because they go through the female. F Uh, Yeah <laughter>. Something like that. C But it does seem, D you know, Yeah. It really does. Yeah. They are, D well, I thought about that. I thought D well, now men, D you know, have to fight to be equal. C And I think that is only right though, D really. He, one guy said the judge looked at him and said, D "Well, D now, Mister So and So," he says, "I have never seen, F uh, calves follow a bull. They always follow the heifer." "That is why I always," he said, "That is why I always give custody to the mama." C And he said, D "Well," he said, "does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and, D you know, butcher them if they get fat?" He said, "My kids are my cattle." D You know. C But that, that is the way most people feel, that women should get custody. Yeah. I am married C and I have got two kids. <Baby_crying>. My husband is not a conformist at all. He is still back there in the seventies <laughter>. <Laughter>. <Laughter> D Well, E I mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jea, not bell bottoms E but, flared pants. C And he, D well I do not like them C but, D you know, to him, Yeah. Any day now <laughter>. D Well, he just, D you know, he is, he is his own person. He, D you know, he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes, C but he wears what clothes he wants to. Which we are both that way. If something is out of style, I do not really care. If I like it I am going to wear it. C But, F uh, my husband is not a conformist at all <laughter>. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, we are trying to keep away from that. My husband works for the railroad. We have got it real tight. C But I have got a four month old baby, C and I do not want to work. I want to tend to her. I want to raise my kids. Uhhuh. D Well, Right. D Well, when he grew up, he grew up with his, we both grew up with single mothers. C And my mom had six kids. C So, she had to work. C And, D you know, I was raised by my sisters and stuff. C And I can, I can't see the difference. C But I know that it would have been better had Mom been able to stay home with us. Right. Right. C And my husband was the same way. C And we just, I want to raise my kids. I do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them. I want to be there to make sure that, D well, they need guidance C and they do need parental guidance twentyfour hours a day. Do you stay home with yours? Uhhuh. They raise them. <Child_talking>. D Well, C but D see D now, Yeah. <<Speaking to child>> Okay, sweetie. Let mommy talk. D Well, I think that's neat. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I know the family is really going through changes. C But now, we are trying to go back to about the sixties, when the parents, D you know, when the mother was staying at home. Unit. C Or that, what do they call it, the nuclear family? Yeah. C But, F uh, <child_talking>. F Uh, D well, my family is Kentucky. D Now my, one of my sisters is down here. Her husband happened to get a job at T I <child_talking>. They moved out here, C but w, his family lives here C and, my husband was in the service when I met him. C And so we, we've been all over <<Speaking to child>> Okay, Kyle <child_talking>. Then I, <laughter> he got a sunburn C and he is itching, C so I am keep having to scratch his back. D See, F uh, <<pause>> I would love to get a business going out of my home. Outside of, E I mean, going, yeah. I would rather work at home, if I could. Yeah. That is the trend. Yeah. They are bringing offices, E I mean, jus, E I mean big businesses into their home. Bringing their computers home and working from there. <Child_talking>. D Well, I think, I think one that would be, F uh, it is, F uh, kids could see their parents, D you know, how hard they work, they would understand more. When, F uh, we first moved down here, I was working. I was working a twelve hour shift, C and it was three and four days a week. C And, F uh, F oh, my little boy just, he went wild. D You know, I mean because, because he had been used to me being there all the time, yeah. C And he is just now, D well, when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home C and it was costing too much at home, than, more at home than I was bringing in. C So, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, it seems like it is totally different. Of course, I do not have much to compare it to. To me, our causes do not seem as important as you all's were. Do you know what I mean? You, you what? Okay. We passed them on to us. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. No. Okay, yeah. D Well <laughter>. F Oh, my goodness. D Now D see, we think of classic rock that they, D you know, have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul. E I mean it was, that is a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles. E I mean we were there. Yeah. I was, D Well, I was, I was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out. I was fourteen years old. Woodstock? D Well, I wanted to go. I was in Chicago. C And I guess I was close to eighteen or something. I, I, it was like, I think, the summer between my, F uh, high school and college. Somewhere around in there. I can't quite remember the year. C And, F uh, F Uh, yeah. We could not, we could not get it together to drive. E I mean, D you know, we had never driven outside of, D you know, ten miles out of town at that time. C And here we were all hep to go to Woodstock, D you know. I really do. You, It would have been incredible. I, I think of, F uh, D you know, all the, social changes that were going on around that time. And, and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness. Everything from, D well, E I mean, I remember we had the first Earth Day back then, D you know, we got out of school at, at, F uh, the university, C and we celebrated Earth Day. Yeah. Planted trees and stuff, C and we did not realize, D you know, the implications of all that then, and a lot of the stuff that goes on today. D Well, D Well, you do. You'll, y, E I mean there w, there was no name to it. It was everything that was started in the sixties. You had, you had to fight for racial equality. C And busing themsel, It was D like just a continuum. D You know, everything sort of had a seed in the sixties. C And women's rights, E I mean, things for women were totally different for you by that time. You just assume. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, we learned from KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, didn't we? <Laughter>. It seems unfair. C But it, D see men are coming into their own now too. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. D Well, are you married C and do you have children? Two kids. C And, C and how does your husband respond to all the new, social, F uh, changes? <Laughter>. D Well, D see, bless his heart, D you know <laughter>. <Laughter>. They are going to be back in style any day now. Oh. Yeah. Oh. D Well D see, that, that is the spirit of the sixties. C And whether we are talking about the rain forests. I tell you, D you know, the situation you have right now C and, C and all of our generations is what to do with the children. Because both mother and father have to work now. F Oh, okay. That's, That's, D see, that is your commitment. You do not know what you are changing when you do something like that. You do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent. F Uh. Uhhuh. That one person that you could always count on being there. D Well, They definitely do. They definitely do. I, F Uh, D well, D see, I, if I had some I would. I, I have not, I had an unfortunate thing happen, C and I am, D you know, C and it is not going to happen that way. C But my, my, F uh, friends are having babies right and left, C so I get to see the different ways that they, F uh, all raise them. C And, C and one gal, she started a business, in her home. C And she, she hired an au pair, which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house. C And the guy lives in with her, D you know, E I mean, D you know, it is a family sort of unit sort of thing C and the, C And so, C So that is a different way. C And then my other girlfriend just, D you know, tears her hair out and goes at it, D you know, twentyfour hours a day, watching both kids all the time. C And I think there is a point where you just have to get away. C And it is good for the kid C and it is good for you to develop, D you know, your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any, F uh, do you have your mom or anybody around you that helps you? Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Oh. Right. D Well, that is, D Well, D see C and, C and that is, F uh, the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home. Right. C And I think, D you know, the more we try to, D you know, shape that, the more input we, have into what that whole system is going to look like. Because that is, that is our choice now too. That is, that is our cause. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Um. Being there all the time. Yeah. Yeah. D See the, the, the economic situation on the whole thing. C And then, F uh, D well it is, D see we do have things that we are <laughter> concerned about here. This generation, I don't know. Social change is always going to go on, C but I think we have taken a big leap in the last, D you know, twenty, thirty years. C And, F uh, nothing is the same. D Well. Yeah. C But we, we grew, we passed them on to you, <laughter> D you know, E I mean, I said, "We passed them on to you." E I mean, D you know, C because it takes a lot of hard work. It takes writing letters to Congressmen and, and, D you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future. C And, C and, F uh, D you know, F um, did we make the right choices? We do not know, we will never know. E I mean, D you know, I, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today. Yeah, I think we made some big wrong choices. C And I think business got in the way. I think the greed of the eighties got,
