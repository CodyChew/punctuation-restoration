My home. All right, my home is about fifteen years old. It's a two story house, it, it's our first home, C and it looks like it's going to be the last, I think we're going to demolish it <laughter>. We've got two children C and it's, they have scraped the, F uh, plaster off the walls, D you know, with riding their little toys through it and stuff. D You know, put dents in the tiles, just multitude of them, E I mean even places, it's, it's past the dent stage, we're talking some of it's been peeled away, D you know, I don't know what they, Yeah, dents in the hole, right. <Breathing> We've got two, one of them's eleven C and one of them's seven C and then the carpet, D you know, we need to replace the carpet. E I mean, it sounds like it's just the pits C but it's not all that bad, I guess C but, D you know, they're just real hard on it. Definitely, I can see why people wait until they get D like in high school or maybe junior high C and then they get another one. I know there's a lot of them. Yeah. Because they're always, because they're always ruining something? How old is your child? D Well, Some appliances breaking or something? C And you said you were in Colorado Springs? Are there a lot of trailers around there? C And is that what you're in? D Well, then that's why you're doing this then, isn't it? F Oh, <laughter> okay, D well, I'm not in T I. I had a friend that had a roommate that worked for T I C and she saw this come up on the computer screen, and ran it off. And passed it to the people that were interested. I know, I've been talking to people in Ohio, and, F uh, Virginia, and I think, California. Yeah, it is. How does she get to work? Uhhuh. I had a re, C and I wish we could down here. <Breathing> D Well, sometimes C but I tell you I'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work, C but if I did it, it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes. I would have to get on one and drive, or walk to a bu, D you know, there's one terminal close to us C and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here, then, I'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school. C So that's too much. Yeah, C but there sure are a lot of people that work down there. Definitely. C And I went down there a couple, maybe three weeks ago for a trial, C and, E I mean, all these people were standing up, that was, D you know, during the workday all along the cur, streets, D you know, just all around these vacant buildings, just a lot of vacant buildings, C and they're just being demolished, C and, C and they stink C and, beer and wine bottles all over the place. Uhhuh. D You know, I think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand. It's gotten big. I think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty, something like that. C And I didn't realize, when I moved here, that it was a separate town from Dallas <laughter>. I know, now <laughter> C but I didn't. I'm from Kilgore, Texas it's in east, F Oh, where you from? Are you? C So, why did you move up to Colorado? D Well, it's real pretty up there. I have a friend, in Denver. What do you, What? They're not owning homes, period. Uhhuh. It wasn't such a bad idea? C So, have you got, F uh, land? I did that one year, I lived with two other girls C and we all taught. C And it was a two bedroom, C so, we took turns, <laughter> D you know, having, sharing the bedroom. I got to where I decided I wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom. C And then we had two baths it was just, one, the little bathroom, were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in. That was in the seventies. Uhhuh. <Sneezing> I'm sorry. Uhhuh. <Sneezing> C So have, Have you got it under? Are you required to by law? We were down here. Yeah, D well, I bet it's not bad. Okay, C but how much is yours? When we bought ours we were paying tw, F uh, three hundred twentynine dollars. For how many years? F Oh, C so, it was still a lot cheaper, C so, it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years, C and we bought one of the cheapest houses, D you know, a tract house. Which probably didn't make much difference. have a in it. In the price. D Gee, nice, F huh. That sounds good. C So, if the economy gets better, are you going to get another one, another house? No? C But you wouldn't take that mobile home, right? You would? It would be cheaper to move that than buy another one. T I would pay to move you? C So, how many years you been up there? Do you snow ski? It's real pretty. I went rock climbing one time. my friend talked me in that <laughter>. I'm a real, F um, scaredy when it comes to heights C but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite, C So, tell me about your home. All right. Yes. We talking from, from dents in the holes. I understand, we've got, I've got a daughter. Kids are hard on houses. Yeah, yeah. F Uh, we live in a mobile home C and that's probably not typical America C but, <Breathing> it's, what we have, it's all we can afford. C And, F uh, seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure, it is with your house. Yeah. Ten, girl. C So, D you know, just like yours, ours is always, D you know, we're, something else goes wrong always, D you know, it's, No, appliances, we had a couple plumbing problems, we've, F oh, who knows, D you know, it's always something with homes. Yes. Yeah, there are there's a big military constituency. F Oh, no, no I'm, I work for T I. F Oh, yes. What division are you in? Oh. It's not a hobby, D you know, it's something to do. I get to here about Texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country, you know, that I've talked to someone in Maryland, I believe it was. It's interesting, isn't it? D You know, the gal I talked to in Maryland, didn't own a car, she's never traveled anywhere, she's never been anywhere, she, D you know, I talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being our roads, C and she didn't understand. She doesn't drive. F Uh, she, F uh, lives on campus, she's a college student. Buses and, and, F uh, public transportation. Her, her parents live by the public transportation. D Well, it would be nice C but I kind of like the freedom, too, don't you? Right. If it's anything like, F uh, Dallas always has been, no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much. Is the crime rate still bad? F Huh. F Huh. Yeah. F Huh, that's terrible. C So, Garland, how nice is it now, it's been a while since I've been there. Yes, it has. D Well, yeah, it is. Where you from? Kilgore, I know where Kilgore is. I'm, I'm originally from Lubbock. Yeah. Seemed like the thing to do at the time. F Oh, I love it, the mountains. I love the mountains, F uh, back to the topic, it seems that, F uh, more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days. Yeah, yeah, F uh, everyone says, D you know, when I bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said, no, no, you're crazy to buy a mobile home. <Breathing> C But now it seems that, F uh, with the local economy bad and T I C and strange it seems that, F uh, F Oh, they're doing some back pedaling. No, I'm renting at the time, C so. Gosh. Yeah. D Well, mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one. Ours is wood s, ours is wood sided, C and it has a traditional V top, roof, C and, F uh, it's nine hundred and eighty square foot. What, two bedroom, one bath, rooms are nice sized. D Well, you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms, one bath, it's, it's comfy. Yes. I, don't know whether it is or not. It was already setup when we bought it. F Oh, yeah, it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere, C and, F uh, D you know, C so, it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be. F Oh, our payments are like two twenty. Fifteen. C And, F uh, what? Yeah, F oh, yes. A mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper, C and, D well, D actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used, D you know, three or four years used, <whispering> and, F uh, D Well, yeah, it did. No, no, no what I meant, not in quality, what I meant was, four years equity costs five hundred dollars. C So, D you know, there's not that much time left on the loan C and, I, don't know. F Uh, to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for. D You know, it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else, somewhere else is easy. Sure. Sure, absolutely. F Oh, absolutely. When I, D you know, when you talk about the deal D like I got, D yeah, D yeah, it would be cheaper. F Uh, especially if it were a paid move or something. D You know, there's some paid moves occasionally. I don't know C but they did, when I, when I moved up here, C so, they might want to move away. F Uh, six or seven. F Uh, a little bit, little bit, mostly I just <noise>, love walking in the mountains, driving in the mountains. F Oh, that's exciting.
