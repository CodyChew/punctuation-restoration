Let me ask you. Do you think the Soviet Union is a, still a threat to the United States? Uhhuh. Right. Uhhuh. D Well, I think there's a, a struggle within the Soviet Union. F Um, I think the people are, are just fed up, C and I think it's showing C and all the republic is trying to gain their independence, C and I think, F uh, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, D hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working. Right. That's right. I think, D Well, that, that could be. You know what I, we always, we think of the K G B and we think such bad things, D you know. C But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, D you know. Exac, exactly. They do. F Oh, yeah, they do, D you know. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, absolutely. That's part of that propaganda thing, C and I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, <sneezing> F oh, E excuse me, I've got a cold today. Thank you. F Um, I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are seeing, seeing it, D you know, thinking K G B and C I A and all that C but, F uh just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they are, they ain't going to be able to feed their people this, this winter, D you know. C But, on the other hand, I'm kind of getting fed up with, F uh, our own country and presidency, F uh, always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet. Right. Right. That's right. D You know, we've got, F uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, F uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on. I think the problem is, D you know, on the international scope maybe the president feels that, F uh, D you know, for longterm relations with all these countries it's important C and D well, we'll, we'll always have the United States. C And, D you know, we need to solve these international problems C but, F um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, F uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on dem, on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it. Right. Right. Yep. No. That's right. That's right. D Well, I, think, F uh, I think in the long, Do you know I don't know what to think. I, I, F uh, the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort. I want to believe that, that they really are trying to change. That, that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society C and I, I want to believe it's all okay. C But then there's that side of me that says, <lipsmack> yeah, C but they've put on faces before. And never to this extent though, D you know, C so, C so it's like there is a struggle within me going do, do I <lipsmack> be openminded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality. D You know I, I trust people. I'll do that. C Or do I keep on going, D well, we'll wait and see <laughter>. Yeah, that's it's not just a mere, or, F uh, western society telling you i, it's, it doesn't work. D You know, they've always said, D you know, the, the Soviet people were united, we believe this, C and maybe they are seeing that, D no, D no, D hey, we don't believe this, D you know. C But, it's still, D you know, I guess I keep that one part of me that's like, D well, I don't know I want to trust them C and I, it's like I can't, C and maybe it's because, D you know, we've had our own propaganda over the years, I don't know. C And they probably do the same things. You think the C I A doesn't spy? I'm sure they do. D Now the difference is we don't, I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe. D You know, I think to that extent we don't go as far C but I'm sure they lie. <laughter> D You know? D So, That's all right. I hope you get better <laughter>. Yeah. <<Very faint>> Yeah. Yeah. That's true. <Lipsmack> C And I'm not against them being concerned C but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and, and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own. D You know, E I mean, D you know, any, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, D you know, because I, I understand that, D you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government. C But at the same time I, I agree. I don't think we can do it and, and just, D you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here. Yeah, we, we, we believe in what he's doing abroad C but, C but like you said there's issues here too. C And C but I, I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union. I'm encouraged by what's happened in, D you know, the, the iron curtain countries, D you know, in, in that block C and, C and I think it's moved in the right direction. I, I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight. D You know, it's not going to. It didn't happen here overnight, C and it didn't happen here without a struggle. D You know. C And I, I think sometimes we forget that. C But I, I, I, I have to say, D yes, I'm, D you know, I'm encouraged by the way it's going. F Uh, F uh,
