Okay, F um, do you like to cook? F Oh, really, what are you making? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. C And do you cook, E I mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, D well D like if you were having a dinner party what, would you cook a variety of things, E I mean, D you know, vegetarian and nonvegetarian? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's something that's, D you know, really easy. In fact I'm having a dinner <laughter> party next Saturday C and that is what I'm having is pasta. D Well for, for Christmas I got a, F um, pasta machine, C and all, all my friends are really anxious, D you know, to have the homemade noodles C so, F um, No it's the hand kind, old fashion kind <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, I D like, D you know, kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me. D You know. C But, F um, yeah, C so that's what I'm going to be cooking, D you know, I thought I would , F um, pasta salad first, C and, F um, then just something for desert, D you know, bread and wine and cheese stuff like that. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. A lot of people think though that I've talked to about it think that it's, D you know a lot of hard work C and I said D heck <laughter> it's kind of easy. Yeah, I do. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, D well, I don't entertain that often, F uh, when I do though I, I have some friends that I always <laughter> like to experiment on. C But, D you know, F um, I see a recipe and think, F oh D wow, I'd really like to try this, cause I'm single C and I live by myself, C so it's not necessarily something that I would cook just for myself. C So I'll say, D okay, you guys are experimental I want say how this is going to turn out <laughter> C but, <laughter> here we go C and usually I'm, I'm pretty good about it. F Um, I have this really good recipe for this, F um, pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing C and, F um, you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything C and my girlfriend and her husband loved it, in fact she passed it on to her parent C and <laughter>, so it's like it really made the rounds C and I was quite impressed with myself if I should say so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, I'm the kind of cook that I don't normally measure things, I just kind of throw them in C and, D you know, I don't to the point of, D you know, measuring down to the exact amount that they say. <Laughter> F Oh, is that what it means. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, I haven't. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, yeah, I've been wanting to take an, F um, oriental cooking class C and I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Yeah, I stir fry things on occasion C but I'd like to know more about, D you know, more elaborate things like guess. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, really. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Um, I just kind of, D you know cook here cook there <laughter>. I don't have any one specialty E I mean I'm always willing to try anything usually. C And I, I especially like baking and making deserts. I've taken a cake decorating class C and, No, no, D actually it was a private course, through D like a com, It is, it's, it's neat C but it takes a long time, D you know, E I mean D like I'm elected to always bring cakes into work <laughter>. Like for people's birthdays and that C and it's like, D you know, you bake the cakes C and then I guess just because I don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it, like, D you know, some, a professional would I try to, I go real slow C and, D you know, it's a little time consuming, C but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. That's okay <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D So. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, my. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. D Well, you learn helpful hints in the classes at least. D You know, the instructor told us certain things about D well, don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, D you know, if you're making just a cake from a box, D you know, do this cause, D you know, make it a variety. D You know, some different hints. Yeah. Some different hints, D you know, C and the different thi, the different kinds of frostings you can make, D you know, C and I have a book an it, C and, D you know, all of the different, D you know, decorating tips an things like that. D So. Yeah, yeah. D Well, yeah <laughter>. Yeah, D so that's about it. Okay, D well. It was nice talking to you. <Laughter> Thank you. Byebye. D Well, I love to cook as a matter of fact I'm making dinner right now <laughter>. F Um, I, F um, I'm making, some, F uh, I have a little turkey left from a passover whi, whi, which was in April. C And I had frozen it C and I'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store, which is like, F uh, rice pilaf, C but we with, with, with wheat kernel that, No, F um, I'm married C and D actually the, my wife is a vegetarian, C so this isn't for her, this is for our friends that came over and helped. helped me do some stuff C so, stuff D so, he and I, C and, C and she's having, I, I do cook, F um, virtually, I cook most of the time because I, Yeah, we, we, consistently, if we cook, if, if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier. C So we'll make something, D you know, F uh, some sort of pasta or something, D you know, homemade pasta or lasagna or something. F Oh, good idea. What, F Um. Electric or, F uh, Best, kind. That, that, that, that's we, we bought one in Italy. That's the best kind to have. Uhhuh, that's real good. F Um. That would be great. Have you made pasta before? F Um, C so D you know, C so D you know that it's a, a lot of fun D actually. I, It actually is, if, if, if you have a food processor, I don't know if you have a food processor or not. D Actually, it, it turns out that i, i, if, if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply. C And then, F um, C and with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta. By throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it, it's, a snap from there. C And then, I made, I making yucky. It's also, people think it's real hard, it just time consuming to get all of the little things right. Otherwise it's real, it's good stuff. What other kinds of, F uh, dinner parties <laughter> do you serve? <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Right, you didn't want to cook. That's great. F Uh. <Laughter>. Yeah, that's how these things sort of make it for one person as an experiment C and, I usually find it when I make up for the first time I usually doctor it just a, little bit and little here and there C and, it works real well. That means you're a real cook. If you've ever watched the ones on television like, F uh, Jeff Schmidt, the super gourmet. He, he just, thro, takes stuff he says, D yeah about an ounce of this <laughter> or something. It's real good. Yeah, we have a, we do, F uh, F uh, middle eastern dinner quite a bit D actually, C or, F uh, we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food. We make, F uh, cause we're my wife is Syrian. C And, F um, her families always have this food she grew up in, C and I've made some of it before as well, C so we make, F uh, four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple. We put them out for people C an, C and that's always a real big kick for people who want, D you know, who've never tried it before. That's, that's, that's, that's a fun idea E I mean if you ever, F uh, want something different to try. I would try that. F Oh, do you have a wok though? Yeah. I think it's God's gift to cooking. Cause it's just quick, it's easy, F um, C and the food just comes out, D you know, if you do it right I think it comes out, the food comes out very tasty not very mushy, D you know, C and, C and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil C so. We li, live in our wok. Yeah, we, we, we like to eat even when we eat out C and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food, or Japanese food or, D you know, Korean, C and that seems to, C so wok food seems to be our thing. D So anything else you cook <laughter>. D Well, that's good, that's always the way to do it. I think it's, F uh,. F Oh, the Wilson course? I like it. That's great, I haven't the Wilson class. <Laughter>. Right. Uhhuh. Yeah, F oh, yeah, we have, F um, my brother can do it, he's, he's, F uh, got a degree in business management C so he learned to, F uh, how to do this. Can you hold on one second? Thank you. Sorry about that. Some one kept beeping in our calling waiting, D so. Yeah, he, he, do, does that a lot, C so, D you know, he cooks a lot C but, D you know, he bakes a lot whenever he, whe, when my wife and I got married the night before we had a party. Or two nights before C and he baked us, he made a real big cake himself, , C so New Years our friend made a baby. Cake like a baby New York. It was amazing I never, could do anything with cakes C so. I get the mold I put, I put it on, D you know, the frosting always melts C and it's, it's just horrible. Yeah, I'm, F Oh that, that you mean about the, mix itself. D Well, that helps. Yeah. D Well, most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they. Those are, those kill me it's like, it's like I'm eating sugar, C but they're good sugar. I think that's part of the problem, yeah. Yeah, I guess so. It was, it was a pleasure chatting with you. Yes, D well, have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week. Byebye.
