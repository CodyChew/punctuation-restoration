Okay. My children are all grown up. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. I'll bet. I'll bet it is. What is the favorite thing you do with your children? Uhhuh. You just watch them play, F huh? I, I tried it once or twice, C but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either. My grandson got me to one day, C but, <Laughter> Different worlds C and how do you get to another world, D you know? C And I, I don't even know what they're talking about. <Laughter>. Do you? Yeah. I know when our kids were growing up, our, we were big into water sports. We had a boat C and they all skied C and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing C and they always took other friends with them C and we had a lot of fun doing that, C but I had all girls C so we didn't do too much sports wise. I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball C and little boys do all of those things C but, Uhhuh. I'll bet you really are. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, when mine were real little, they all played soccer C but, D you know, that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls C and then they got more interested in other things, <Laughter> I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age, that it was boys, C but I think that's probably what it was. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. <Laughter>. C But they, C but you enjoy them, I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them. Uhhuh. C And, E I mean, I didn't, it wasn't that I didn't like them when they were little, C but the older they got, I enjoyed them as teenagers. C And now that they're each, of course three girls, they're each becoming the, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them. How, what kind of mothers they are, what kind of wives, D you know. How they do things C and, Two of them live real close to me. C So we, we spend a lot, most of our time spent with them is, they come over to eat. And bring the kids C and we play with the kids, D you know. C But, F uh, Where d, F oh, we go camp out, they camp out C and we spend weekends at the, in the country with them quite a bit, C but as far as doing any activity, now that the grand kids are here, we all just stay around the house mostly. <Laughter> It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. They'll always remember it, too. I hear mine saying, D well, I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so. I need to take my boys to do this or that, D you know. C And I remember the year we went to Disneyworld, as quick as my kids are big enough, we're going to go to Disneyworld <laughter>. D You know <laughter>. Yeah, they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun. C But, Do you work? Uhhuh. It really does. The time you have with them has to be quality time then. I imagine that they have, F uh, some, a lot of homework, too. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well, there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though, C and especially if they're active kids. Like you say you bowl. Oh. Okay, D well, D now D see, I've got two children C and, F uh, they're, one is o, F uh, just turned to be a teenager C and the other one is on his way, C so. <Laughter> I, F uh, I'm a single parent, C so I think it makes it more difficult for me to, F uh, D you know, find time with my, my children since I work C and then, of course, take care of the house C a, and all this good kind of stuff. F Uh, C so it's a real, F uh, it's a real problem for me. Yeah. F Uh, the, the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together. C And, F uh, the kids like to play Nintendo, C but I'm no good at it, <laughter> C so I don't like to play. That's right, that's right. <Laughter> Me either. Yeah, they talk about these different levels and stuff C and I've never got off of level one <laughter>. Yes. I, I know, I agree with you, C so, F uh, C But, no, the other thing I think we like to go to the movies, too. That's, yeah, that's a, that's a neat thing. C So I guess we're all in, F uh, D you know, movie, F uh, fanatics or whatever around here. C So we like to do those kind of things. Uhhuh. F Oh, how neat. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, D see, I have a son C and, F uh, D you know, it's football in the fall and, and baseball in the spring C and, C and it's one activity after another. I, I'm constantly going back and forth. Yeah. C And my daughter has, F uh, tennis, C so it's between tennis and, and bowling. My, I bowl C so, D you know, we're pretty active as a sports, D you know in, in the family, C so, It, it's really neat. <Throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Boys <laughter>. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. I, I know that, F uh, my daughter, F uh, even though she goes out with the, the sports and everything, F uh, D yeah she likes to watch the football for, F uh, the kids <beep>. I'm sorry. F Uh, that was a cat that hit the telephone. Get away, cat, gosh <<speaking to cat>>. I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because <laughter> there's all kind of activity that goes on. C But, F uh, yeah, my, F uh, my kids are, they're starting to grow up, D you know. It's not going to be too many more years before I, F uh, F uh, D you know, they'll be gone C and, C and, F uh, there won't be as many activities. Do you, F uh, Yeah, I, I agree with you. I, I do. I'm so glad they're out of the, that young, real young age C and the babies, Right. Yes, yes. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's so true. D Well, do you, do the, do your daughters live close where you can go out? F Oh, good. F Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Uh. F Oh, yeah <laughter>. That's true. F Oh, yes, F oh, yes. D Boy, I know, especially when they grow up like that, C so I'm trying to, these last five or six years, I'm trying to make them really special and F uh, very precious since that's, F uh, about the only time we've got left. Yes, yes, absolutely. I, I think so, too. Uhhuh, uhhuh. <Laughter>. There we go. I know, I know they can't wait <laughter>. That's right, that's right. Yeah, C so D well, I still got a few more years, C so I'm, F uh, I'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them. Yes, uhhuh, I sure do. C And I work full time, C so, F uh, it, it, that cuts into our free time right there. That's right, that's right C and, F uh, vacations are very special for us, and activities. Yeah, yeah. D You know, this being a school night and stuff, C so, F uh, it's, it's in the same old y, D you know, routine of, F uh, D you know, doing homework and, D you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, F uh, the other activities that we all have. Uhhuh.
