Okay, F uh, you want to start by telling me what camping is to you. Do you backpack or hike C or, No, I've never done a canoe trip. That sounds interesting. F Oh, D man, I imagine. C So they'll D actually fit in the canoe C and then you go for days at a time. D God, that sounds like fun <laughter>. D Well the camping I grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type. C And, F uh, D you know, that just C either out in the woods, C or D actually I, I grew up water skiing. I was, F uh, from California, C and so we would go up to the Sacramento, F uh, river sloughs, the delta there, C and you just pick a campground on the river, if it got, D you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water. D You know, cooled off, C but, F uh, when I got married, my husband had always backpacked. C And so we did that, F uh, I guess we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago. C And that was a new experience for me C but I enjoyed it. I like being able to go back into the mountains, or, D you know, where the trail didn't necessarily lead, and where you couldn't necessarily, pitch a tent <laughter>. C But, F uh, that, that was interesting. I, I have always wanted to do some white water rafting C and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that. Don't let that stop you <laughter>. I know. Yeah, C so you haven't done that before. My parents, F uh, were sailing, F uh, this last year down off, F uh, Costa Rica C and they took about two weeks and went into, I don't even know the name of the river there, C but they went white water rafting C and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience. She said it was truly incredible. C And, D you know, I, there's that sense of it, D you know, you're kind of scared, that risk of D like D gosh, what could happen and then the thrill of, D you know, the excitement of doing it, C so. D Well, do you have anything planned for this summer? F Oh, okay. F Oh, I imagine. F Oh that doesn't, that sounds good. That sounds, We've been wanting to start camping again this year too. F Uh, my oldest child is a girl, was born three years ago, three and a half. C And then I have a little one that just turned two C and we are in the process of potty training. I didn't want to go camping with diapers, D you know. I, C and, C and, D you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is, D you know, some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent, they'd be awake all night. C So, C but I think with him almost potty trained and, D you know, she's not afraid of her shadow anymore, that I'm, I'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go, F uh, this summer, D you know, even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days, or something to get them used to it and get them started, F uh, with little back packs of their own, and, D you know, things like that. Uhhuh. D Well that's true. D Ugh, I would need that before I could teach them <laughter>. D Well, F uh, a little bit, F uh, noth, nothing overly strenuous. No, the majority of my camping experience is, F uh, a tent by the lake type situation or, F uh, maybe a canoe trip or something like that. F Oh, it, it's, we've had a lot of fun, F uh, I, I moved to Dallas about five years ago C and we've made three different trips since I've been here. A The group of friends that I run around with, of varying degrees, F uh, of difficulty. The, the last one we did, A and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was, F uh, was a canoe trip in Arkansas C and the river was, it was up about three feet C so it was, F uh, it was pre, it was pretty challenging. C But, F uh, C and then we, F uh, as far as the camping part of that, we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and, F uh, find, F uh, find a clearing in the woods and go for it. D Well, yeah, yeah, it's the, that, that particular one was a two day trip C so what, F uh, there's, F uh, there's a outfitter C and, F uh, they haul you up to the headwaters, come down about halfway and then you get to, you spend the night C and then, F uh, the second day head on down to the, to the pool at the end of the river. Yeah it, it really is. Okay. Okay. Right, right. Okay. D Boy, I bet, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that's, that was, F uh, that's always been our next step. Our, our little group of friends here, we've been kind of getting married off and what not C but, F uh, Yeah, that, D well, it, it just puts a damper on things for a little while. C But we're, we're starting to get everybody back together. Yeah, we'd like to do a float trip down, F uh, F oh, like Big Bend area or something like that. No, no, we haven't made that trip yet. I'll bet, yeah. Uhhuh, yeah, exactly. F Um, not really just yet. We've, F uh, D well I, I do have, F uh, a little bit of property, I grew up in South Dakota, C and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet. There's, F uh, there's a little lake up there C and, F uh, a group of friends that I, I went to college with, F um, got together C and we basically own all the land around this little lake, there, it's divided up into ten lots. C So, we've got a private lake, C and it's completely undeveloped at this point, C so, that's a possibility. C And the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime. It, it's, it's about two hours north of Minneapolis. C So, F uh, yeah, in fact, F uh, F uh, D well I got married last summer C and, F uh, that's, that's, we ended up there for a couple days, F uh, on our honeymoon. We kind of took, F uh, a tour of the United States for about a week, and, F uh, up through that area. C But, F uh, my wife's real excited about it, C so, we're, F uh, we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno, last year it was the end of July C and it was a little too late for the fish C but, F uh, hopefully get up there early enough to, to get into some of the, some of the fish and, F uh, the, the good weather and what not. Uhhuh. F Oh gosh, yeah, yeah. That's right. Sure. Right. You bet, yeah, we'll that, D you know C and there's a lot of places with, F uh, D like nature trails, things like that where they could learn a lot, too. D You know, it's like, D okay, this, this is, this is what, F uh, a pheasant looks like, D you know, C and D okay, now we'll go look for one. <Laughter> D Well, yeah, that's, ever, everybody might learn something that way, C but, F uh, C but yeah that's, there is, there's an awful lot of things set up, D you know, just any, anything you want to do. Like, like you say it can be, F uh, a water ski trip, or fishing trip or just a sightseeing, bird watching, D you know, hunt, hunt with a camera type of thing C or, there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that. It's a lot of fun, it really is. Hello.
