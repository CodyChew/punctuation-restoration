F Um, I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles C and I love to walk, C so if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and, and walk. What about you? F Uh, very good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. I know, my son is a biker C and he, he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts. C And so, C but that somehow takes, organization. For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, D you know, it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading, F Um, C but, No, I live in Maryland. Right, right, C and that's it, F um, at work we have a, a nice campus, C so I'm able to, F um, take advantage of, of the environment here. F Uh, the neighborhood, also. E I mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops C so I do. D Now, I think, F um, basically, is your motive simply, F um, health or because you enjoy it? Uhhuh, right. I think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also. F Oh, D well, that's great, that's great. Uhhuh. Right. C And D actually in, in summer I like to swim. We don't have facilities for swimming in winter, C but, F um, C and, C and that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake, I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening. D So. No, I'm not. No. F Oh, really. <Laughter> No, I don't know that. C But, I, I must say, that, F um, when, when I did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, F um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent. C And it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California, C and at that point that was sort of the limit C but since then I've been abroad a lot, C so. It's a mixture. In Santa Barbara. F Oh, I see. Uhhuh. D Well, very good, I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits C and, F uh, it was nice talking to you. F Oh, okay. Byebye. D Well, do you exercise regularly, Judy? Uhhuh D Well, F um, I, F uh, exercise regularly. I work at a university, C and I swim almost every day upwards of a mile, C but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit. F Uh, my daughter lives in Arlington, C and when I go to visit her, I love to get out on that bike trail, and C either ride the bike, F oh, D gosh, you can ride a bike <laughter> practically all the way to Southern Virginia or just get out and walk, F uh, or even jog a little, although I don't do that regularly. C But Washington's a great place to do that. Uhhuh. <Cough>. Right. Do you live in the District? C Because I think there're so many parts of the District <laughter> where it's not very safe to get out and walk. Uhhuh. D Well, it's, F uh, it's really both. I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, C and, F uh, C and most of the time I enjoy it. Sometimes I don't, C but I feel that, F uh, that the discipline it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something. C And I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising, like I'll be really tired, C and I'll start swimming, C and I'll, C and I'll actually get energy. C And I'll be, have much more energy when I'm done than when I started, E I mean, I just feel great. That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim. C And that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, D God, I'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while, C but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific. Yeah, yeah. D So, can I just ask you, are you Canadian? Philadelphia? I'm trying to because you have a, you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the T I people crazy. Say out, instead of out you say out. Did you know that? Huh. Huh. I see. I know this isn't on our topic, C but where did you grow up in California? F Oh, okay, C because I grew up in North Hollywood, California went to U C L A and all that. Yes. D Well, same here. Thanks for calling. Bye.
