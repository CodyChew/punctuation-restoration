D Well, I'm, are you there? Okay. I'm sure that I probably, F uh, prescribe to different magazines ones that you do <laughter>. I take DOLL READER and DOLL WORLD <laughter>. Because I collect dolls <laughter>. F Uh, I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. <Swallowing> I like that. C And then, F uh, my husband, he just, F uh, subscribed to a wood, he just started a woodwork C so he just sent away to get some woodworking books. D So what kind do you, F uh, get? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Is it, Yeah, I used to take that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I, if I, D you know, if I happen to find it, I'll go ahead and read it someplace, D you know, if I'm in a doctor's office or something like that C but other than that I never, I never liked that really. I read my newspaper. I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here, D you know. C So I do like to read the newspaper. F Uh, even this little newspaper that Patterson puts out. In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays <sniffing>. I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news <laughter>. C But, F uh, other than that, magazines, I don't know. There's so much advertising in them anymore. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Huh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, D well I, I only, D you know, subscribe to the things I'm interested in. I used to be into coin collecting C so I used to get the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, D you know. I used to get that. C So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really, really want, D you know. No, huhuh. F Uh, I think they're interesting. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. D Well those travel magazines, are that, more or less, show you different countries that you could go to C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Okay. D Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about. F Uh, I don't take anymore than that <laughter>. D You know, D so. D Well I guess that will be it then C and, Yes, yes. Different set <laughter> <noise>. Uhhuh. Oh. . D Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science C but beyond that, F uh, lately I've been reading, I've always liked the NEW YORKER. C And lately I've been picking up some of the travel, F uh, both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines. F Uh, trying to keep up on what's going on. my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. BON APPETITE, and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET. Yeah. C And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much C but she seems to. Do you read a newspaper? <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> Some of them I used to get for the advertising. Like BYTE magazine which is, F uh, one of the larger computer ones. I haven't bought it now for about eight years. C But when I used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three hundred of them advertising. C Because that was interesting. I think a lot of the trade magazines are like that. That, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are. C But, D you know, some of the get ridiculous. TRAVEL AND LEISURE, all of the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines C so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, F uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for C and, <Laughter> it is, it's clear that, I, I've bought some of these through wholesalers <noise> C and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads. Uhhuh. Have you ever, F uh, read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time? <Laughter> But not worth it. I, I've always had this, one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective. C So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them. C And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on <laughter>. C So I, D like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, F uh, organization magazines C and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective. F Uh, D you know, their major interest is in commissions C and, D you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines. Their major talk is about, D you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is C and it gives you a different <laughter> perspective on what people do. F Uh, some of them. The, the general travel magazines do. I don't tend to read it for that. Because I don't expect to be traveling overseas in, in the future for quite awhile. C But I, I usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff. No. Yeah. I don't take much more in myself. Okay. Okay, nice talking to you.
