D Well, I kind of like them all. I played for about eighteen years, all the way through college, and then, F uh, kind of hung them up after college, C but, <laughter>. No, not quite. Made it, yeah, made it all the way through four years of college playing ball, C but, D Anyway. F Uh, being in Rochester, you probably like the Mets. <Laughter>. F Oh, D boy, it, I think it's D like one or the other, isn't it. E I mean, Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, okay, I see, yeah, I like the, F uh, F huh, I guess if I had to pick a favorite team, any more, as well as, I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia. I'm from New Jersey originally. Yeah, D well, we were thirty miles south of them, C so. Yeah, right down the river, C but, F uh, C so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry? <Laughter>. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I was going to talk to you about that eightysix team <laughter>. That was, that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings, right. Yeah. <Laughter>. D Hey, the guy's making millions, he ought to be able to perform, right. D Well, his knees were bothering him, yeah. Yeah, for having him out there. Sure. F Oh, boy. Yeah, I think we were all pretty much, F uh, Astros fans, in the National League Championship Series C but there's D like two fellows from, F uh, Brooklyn, C and they, they were, D you know, they were pretty much without having to say, they were pretty much Mets fans <laughter>. No, not really, they were pretty much thugs, they weren't scared very much, D you know <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Really. Okay, okay. D Well, I'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs, C but these two were definitely thugs, C and they were from Brooklyn <laughter>. C So I'm kind of hoping, I, I, I guess, F uh, any more I pretty much pull for the Rangers though. They're, F uh, they're, they're they, they have, I think they have the best facilities in the major leagues. I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium. It's great. Yeah. The only problem is it's not large enough. It only holds about, I think they, when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player, they squeezed about forty thousand people in there. Yeah, C so they're, they, they have plans, E I mean, the owner tried to move them to Florida C but, F uh, they ended up sticking around in Arlington, C and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington, as a matter of fact, not even in Dallas, C So that's, that's something that we're looking forward to. F Oh, case in point, Toronto. Yeah, have you seen a game up there? F Oh, boy, I saw it, I was up there on business, F uh, last June and watched a game in the sky dome. It was just phenomenal. That's, that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums, I think. Uhhuh. D Now is Rochester, where, where is Cornell University. Ithaca. Okay. Yeah, D well Rochester is D like right on the shores, isn't it? Yeah, okay. <Laughter>. F Oh, D Well, they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Those games are fun to watch. You, you, you watch those games? Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah, we used to like watching, my, my folks lived down in Beaumont, C and, F uh, on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres, I think, C but, F uh, they, they were fun games to watch. Someti, D well, there's definitely a lot more hitting <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. C So as far as the major league teams, <barking> I don't know, the Rangers have been, D you know, every year they always knock on the door early, and then just go into their skid about, D you know, the end of June. C But they, they've got so much young, raw talent, it's just amazing, C and then they just haven't been able to put anything together. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Right. Yeah, E I mean, they've been, they've been young for a while, C and they're almo, almost starting to age a little bit here, I just, F um. Yeah, yeah, they, they really hurting pitching wise. E I mean, they've got Ryan, C but, D you know, who knows what he'll be able to do. He's been, last year he started having some nagging injuries, C and C but, it'll, it'll be interesting to watch. I hope to get up there. We, we usually try to get to opening day game. There's several guys from our church try to go up there. Yeah, D well, I, I guess we're probably, F oh, maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas. No, not too bad, C but it takes about two hours, two and a half hours to get there. <Laughter>. That's probably because of the roads. You just don't have, we, we've just got a freeway. We just get right on the freeway and just go north. D Well, it's so crowded up there. Golly. Yeah. F Um. D Well, yeah, you're, you're like a boat ride from, how far is it across the lake to Canada? Toronto? Yeah. Do, do you drive there, C or do you take the ferry, or what? Yeah. Yeah, it's a, it's a beautiful city. Uhhuh. C So, C and then, E I mean, you go back to New York after school? F Oh, really. D Well, what kind of weather are you having right now? F Oh, boy, yeah, we've been up in the, F oh, seventies, eighties, even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago. Golly. Because of the ice? F Um. Golly. F Huh, illegal, F Oh, yeah. Okay, F um, D so, F um, do you have any favorite teams? F Oh, I was going to say, you played pro ball, right? Not quite, F huh. Oh. Yes, I'm D actually a Met, I'm, I'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Mets fan, and an avid Yankee hater. Yeah, it's, it's, I, I, I find it very strange. F Um, more people, D you know, real Met fans don't like the Yankees C and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason. I never fou, I never quite found a New York fan. I always found a fan, D you know, of C either one C or the other, C and so, that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox by default, because I went to college also in Boston. Oh. Yeah, C so that, C so that's sort of close enough. F Oh, C so you were pretty close. D Well, I don't know. F Um, there's, there's a part of me that says that, D you know, F um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away. D You know, when, when he sort of went away, I started thinking, D yeah, D well, he was performing fairly well, C but he really wasn't worth the baggage, D you know. F Um, I think they're okay, I think they're, D you know, I think they have enough people who are, who are, who are still in their prime, D you know. F Um, E I mean, certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, D you know, F um, eight years ago or something, they're they're, they're, they're, D you know, they're sort of in, in good standing, whereas, D you know, F um, <noise> <<knocking sound>> I think, I certainly don't think they're the eightysix team any more. Yeah, I, Right, they beat Houston in extra innings, C and then they D actually won the series byebye sort of a sneaky route, F um, against Boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner. I felt real bad about that, C but D hey, what can you do. That's right, D well, D actually, he, he, he was supposedly, F um, there was, there was something wrong with him at the time, C and I, Right, C and I, C and I understand that, C and I say, D Hey if the guy can't play, you don't blame that, F uh, hit it to him, you blame the team, D you know, for putting him in, That's right, C so. C So, I, I, I was, F uh, I was also, I was in school at Boston at the time. C So, I, it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and, F um, half Sox fans. Oh. <Laughter>. Yeah, yeah, D well I guess they were, F uh, I guess they must have been scared <laughter> after the, F uh, D Well, that's good, D well, they're Brooklyn boys, I guess. You don't expect them to be, F uh, much of anything but thugs. I know. I was born there. F Um. Yeah, I, I was, I was also born in Brooklyn, C so I can call myself a Brooklyn thug, although I'm really not. <Laughter>. Yeah. <Laughter> D Well, that, that's D actually, I think I make something, because I think, C and, C and, C and in as much as sort of fan support helps. D You know, it's good to have, F um, Yes, it is kind of small. Right. F Oh, that's great. C So, Yeah, that'll be nice, E I mean, that, that, I think, tends to keep, I think stadiums work tend to keep people happy. Yeah, exactly. F Uh, I haven't been to any Toronto games yet. C But, F um, Of stadiums, yeah, D well, E I, I mean to get up there. E I mean, the, the best I've been up here so far, D you know, up, in up state New York is, F uh, is, F um, Rochester Red Wings game. F Oh, Cornell is in Ithaca. F Uh, yeah, C so Cornell is about, F um, somewhere, F uh, about two and a half hours south of, south and east of us. C So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of. Yeah, we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario. D Actually whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion, because they built it, they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city. F Um, C but they, F Oh, D really, I ne, I hadn't actually known that. D Well, F um, C but we have our own, F um, our own triple A team here the Redwings, which are they're a farm team for the Orioles. C So everybody hopes that, F uh, they go all the way around here. There's the, they're the big team in Rochester. F Oh, yeah, I D actually, we, we, we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun. Lots of really big, D you know, lots of local fans, D you know, small stadium, D you know, F um, C and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes, D you know F um, especially, D you know, I'll make a day game or something. C But they really seem to, F uh, people really get into it. E I mean, I can't, I, I, again, I can't make any predictions about them, C but I suspect they'll go, F uh, they'll go fly. Yeah. Those are, those are, F uh, I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes. Yes, it's true. One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are F uh, F uh, D you know, I guess, I guess when you start pitching real well, D well, move them up. D Bam. Yeah, C but F um. <Laughter>. D Well, the way I, the way I see it, is, E I mean, F um, D you know, I can use a Met analogy here. If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of, well trained D you know, back to, D you know, maybe eighty, eightyfour or eightythree or eightyfive, D you know, when they were first, when they weren't quite the eightysix team that, that, that they were. I, I, that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year, I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself up. <Laughter>. Right, C but. F Oh, that must be nice. D Well, that isn't too bad. Just a couple of hours. Yeah, D well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium. C So, I don't know. Yeah, D well, D actually, we can, we can, I can take a highway the whole way down, C but it's still, it's some it's, it's almost four hundred hou, E I mean, E I mean, it's almost four hundred, D you know, barring traffic, it's four hundred hours, E I mean, four hundred mil, four hundred hours, right, <laughter> four hundred miles barring traffic, C so, it's, F um, it's, it's, D you know, it's a heck of a drive. We are substantially north of New York enough that, F uh we don't get to go play too often. Toronto. F Oh Toronto's only about two hours, yeah. Toronto, E I mean, I want to go see. F Um, I can, I've D actually I've driven, C but I've heard about the ferry as well. Haven't taken it yet, though. Have you taken it? Yeah, F um, I, I really love, I think that's one of the most, F uh, enjoyable things about being up here. I'm only up here for school. F Uh, no, probably south, maybe Texas <laughter>. Some place south, and warm, I don't, I'm not a big, F uh, I'm not a big, F uh, cold fan. F Uh, right now we're actually having, F uh, it's getting nice. E I mean, it was in the high fifties today, C but three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm <laughter>. F Oh, that's great. D You know, about that same time branches were falling off everywhere, C and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks. C Because it, didn't make the nat, national news too much, which I find really weird C but, F um, we were, E I mean, F um, D you know, all schools were closed for almost, for over, for a week. There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive. Yeah, C because they had so many power lines down C and so many, F uh, things like that, C so they were...
