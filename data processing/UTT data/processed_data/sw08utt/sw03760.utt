Okay, F uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time. F Uh, I basically read books. It is, I do. Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed, C so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am, I have about three books that I am going on. C And I will work on one for a little bit, D you know, and then the next one. C But that's just kind of, <Laughter> Not always, just sometimes. F Uh, just really different ones. F Uh, I have one that I was reading on, F uh, raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another one on, F uh, F uh, F uh, like a crime story <children>. A true crime story. Yeah. C But this, it was a true one. It was just a little different though. <children> Reading that one last night. Yeah, like my husband. Yeah <children>. You must, F uh, work for T I? Yeah, my husband does too. Yeah. Uhhuh, really. F Oh, really. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What kinds of things do you fix? Oh. C And you have a shop? Yeah. Yeah, you can fix just about everything and anything. D Well, that is great. Yeah. Yeah. That is pretty much like my husband. He is, he is pretty, F uh, mobile in that area too. He, he works on the cars. He rarely takes them in C and, F uh, he works on irons, and all T V s and stuff too. We rarely have to take those things in too. F Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. F Uh. Not really. E I mean during Christmas I work on, D you know, like, F uh, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things. C But, C but, F uh, not really <laughter>. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. F Uh, I belong to this organization for, F uh, if, if you have preschool children C and, F uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, F uh, section for the moms C and those are really neat C and we learn to do the, F uh, transfer pictures <noise> on the sweatshirts transfer photos C and, F uh, those are really neat. C So we learn different crafts like that F uh <noise>, Yeah. No <laughter> I cook dinner <laughter>. I don't consider it a hobby <laughter>. C But, F uh, D you know, I no I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately. I like to bake off and on. C And usually once a week I will bake something, C but it's not anything elaborate, D you know <laughter>. At least, I don't think it is. D So, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. D Well good. You have a computer at home? F Oh, good. Yeah. F Oh, really. Wow. Then you are busy <children>. Uhhuh, that is very good. <Laughter> D Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading, C and I stopped because it was so, it's the book is so detailed C and you have to, sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all. C And, F uh, it is so detailed, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going. F Oh, yeah. C And what what kind of books do you read? F Oh yeah <children>. F Oh, do you like those detective stories? <children>. F Oh, D well that is interesting. D Actually, I like to read also, C but, F uh, usually fall into one or two categories, C either true science fiction C or fantasy on the one hand C or highly technical. Yeah <children>. Yeah, kind of one or the other. F Uh, I do. Yes. Yeah, C and I am a computer scientist. C But, I have a lot of other hobbies. D Well, yeah, I am kind of, F uh, I guess what you would call it, a project person. Yeah, C and I love, D like I have a shop C and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself C and so, hobby, it's, its' funny, F uh, from the one stand point, it is work. C But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy to do. To find broken, D Well, essentially anything you find in a house. F Uh, a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, F uh, chipped tile on the floor. E I mean just anything. D Well it, it is not anything elaborate. It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools. C But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably, Right. C And in the car, I guess the car too. C And so, F uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby. Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive. Yeah I, Right. Yeah, I think it, it, not only can it be fun, C but it can certainly help your finances. C So, do you have any art, F uh, A how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies? F Oh yeah, D well that's good. Yeah. D Well, I don't necessarily either. I can plink out a song or two on a piano C and I can, F uh, I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art, I guess F uh, graphic arts is that what they call it, I can't do any of that, C but sweat shirts is certainly impressive. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yeah. Uhhuh. I see. D Well, that is neat <children>. I guess you could consider that a hobby. Do you, do you cook for a hobby C or do you, <Laughter> That's not something you, I understand that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. C But, I think that still borders on hobby. Probably the other thing I do which <noise> I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. F Uh, on the computer. C So, I have little projects <children> little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies. C But, drive my wife crazy. I do, yes. In fact, there is actually several of them here right now. Not all of them being mine. Yeah. F Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children <children> as being a hobby? <laughter>. Uhhuh.
