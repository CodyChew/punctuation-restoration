Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. Yeah, I have not even heard, believe it or not, of that person. I'm not kidding. When you, when you said it, it was kind of like a surprise. Yeah. I think mainly because I haven't been watching what's politically going on. F Uh, in that at, D you know, in that aspect. I, as far as D like now, the new house bill that went to Minnesota, F uh, being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota, I'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that, and that being passed. C But, F uh, as far as politics in the grander, F uh, part of it as if you want to look at, F uh, election type things, I'm not quite sure even if I'm going to vote. F Uh it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that, to make the decision on who would be the best to run. F Uh, Uhhuh. Sure. Exactly. Uhhuh. Sure. Uhhuh. Sure. He might be a, a one of those, sure. F Uh, it, it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer, F uh, when you think of some of the best presidents we've had, in the past, have been people that have struggled to get to the top. E I mean, they were not rich in in any means C and it has been kind of, in the past, F uh, I don't know, maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics, they've had to have money. C And you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way. F Uh, C so it makes the common person, F uh, not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent C and I don't know if we'll ever see that D you know. Where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and, F uh, has, F uh, D you know, you think of Abraham Lincoln and, D you know, just the background of Abraham Lincoln. D You know, teaching himself to read. He didn't go to college. He didn't, D you know, do all the other things that, F uh, D you know, you would think that was real popular to do and to get po, politically involved in and have money. He didn't come from money. F Uh, C and now it's, Uhhuh, sure. Uhhuh. Yeah <laughter>. C So you really know a lot of his background. It was the big one. It's the one that everybody wants. Yeah. Whether or not I, D you know, you look at all these candidates that want to become president. I really have to ask them why, D you know. F Uh, it's the toughest job in the world to do. C And not only that, you don't have that much freedom to make choices. E I mean you have to go through so many different, you have to go the House, the Congress, and all of the o, other things to get a bill passed. C And sure you can veto <<mispronounced>>, veto it at the last minute C but then it's not like you have all that power C and I think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power. <Clicking> D So interesting political trends or events, F huh? D Well, <laughter> I guess the, F uh, most interesting one that's, F uh, going on right now, from my perspective, is this, F uh, phenomena of, F uh, F uh, Ross Perot. F Uh, caught his interview last night with David Frost C and it was the, the first time I had, D you know, heard, F uh, his views expressed by himself. I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in. C But the whole phenomena of him coming out of, F uh, literally nowhere and no party. F Uh, at least, no apparent party support on either side <swallowing> is pretty interesting. Uhhuh. Like out of nowhere? Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. D Well, it seems that the decision, so far, has been filtered by, F uh, D you know, party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval, party support and therefore get presented to the public, the, the candidates are already beyond what, F uh, most public, F uh, feels is acceptable behavior. D You know, the, one of the common criticisms of Clinton is, F uh, gee, he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House. C And, C and, up and to the point of, F uh, Perot being a serious candidate, it seems like that, that was a requirement of being a, a contender within the party is to have done all those things. E I mean, here's, here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward, D you know, getting the party nomination and, and preparing himself for the presidency C and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are, D you know, pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And, C and yet even he was a, a consummate politician in the sense that, F uh, not only did he, F uh, fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure C but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one. C And the first d, C and the first and only election he won was, F uh, the presidency <laughter>. He, he had lost every other office that he had, D you know, he was appointed a couple of times to, like, F uh, F uh, state legislator. <Laughter> Yeah. Then, then when he finally, D you know, did win an election, F uh, D you know, it was the presidency. Yeah. Yeah. C But, <Laughter> Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.
