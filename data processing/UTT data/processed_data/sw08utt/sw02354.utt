Okay, what kind of books do you like to read, for enjoyment? Uhhuh <music>. What kind of business is it? Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds interest, that sounds fun <laughter>. What kind of business is it? Uhhuh. Really? Uhhuh. D Well, that's interesting. A what? F Oh, really? D Well that sounds interesting <sniffing>. My mom always wants me to open a health food store C but, I'll, I'm not really into it, I don't know the infor, I don't know that much about it, D so D anyway C but, D well that's interesting. I, personally, I like mostly <lipsmack> F um, if I had a book of my choice, I like books, I go to the library a lot C and it seems like I always, I never go to the fiction section, E I mean that to me is just ridiculous, it's like, life is to interesting to read fiction C but I always get books like, F um, I like to quilt, D well I'm not into quilting C but I check a lot of books out to learn how. I just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book, C but I like to, F um, can and do food preservation, C and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff, C and I like to check books out like that C and I always come away with, I'm a Christian C and I enjoy reading books about F um, <lipsmack> I have a real heart for people involved in cults C and, so I have a real, D you know, heart for them, C and <laughter> I'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today C and that's just where my heart is C so, I read a lot of books on that C and, D you know Christian books written by people about, D you know to help you out and stuff C and I read the Bible. I don't read the Bible as much as I should C but C but I think I would always think that no matter what I did C so, C but I do enjoy reading that <lipsmack> C and, so pretty much we have different interests, I think, in reading, <noise> <<sounds like a motorcycle>> C but, C and I have a neighbor with a big motorbike C and he likes to run down the street with it C and you, you can probably hear him. <laughter> C But, F um, I don't know C so. Do you enjoy reading anything like that? F Um. Uhhuh. Thirty or younger, Is that what you said? F Oh, ten years younger, F oh, that's funny. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Yeah, Maureen Solomon. I had a, a friend of mine has a book by her right now called FOODS THAT HEAL. They eat a lot of it, D you know, you can take your vitamins C and she was telling me to take zinc, C so, <laughter> D anyway I've been taking enough zinc, D you know <laughter> to kill a horse probably <laughter> I hope it doesn't hurt me C but, D anyway, <laughter>. I did read one chapter of that <laughter>. Uhhuh. No, I haven't. Uhhuh. The quantities C and, What's the name of it again? LIFE EXTENSIONS? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Really? Uhhuh. F Oh, really? Really? I know there's not any food that you can get, C and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore, C and I know my, my husband's uncle owns di, some acreage in, a, Eastland, Texas, which is in West Texas, owns C and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, D you know C and, F uh, we get blackeyed peas off of it and stuff C but, I know that, D you know, the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you, C but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live. I think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations, D well the last couple of processed foods, D you know, E I mean, C but, <lipsmack> I don't know. I like to, I like to, my, I like to be able to eat really healthy, D you know, C and, I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though because I do, don't think we're going to restore the earth to, D you know, I think <laughter> Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be, C but, F uh, in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm always looking down my plate C and I think D man this stuff was probably grown in who knows what, D you know, kind of environment C but I do take some vitamins on the side C and, I do like reading books like that I just, I have a hard time, a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth C and we're going to restore the earth. I just don't see that. I think, E I mean, I think to think that is almost, it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the, you know what I'm saying? It's C and I think God's in charge C and God's going to restore it when he wants to C so sometimes I get bogged down in the, <breathing> D you know, in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking, C but, D you know there's a balance in it sometimes I read stuff like that C and then I just chunk off like water off your back, some of it, C and, D you know, C and try and do what's, what I can do out of it that's practical, C but, anyway, F uh, Uhhuh <noise>. Uhhuh. Because it's what? Oh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh <breathing> <<heavily>>. Uhhuh <noise>. F Um. Really? Really? D You know I bet that's why we have some friends that eat only, I just took this Amish bread out of the oven, D man, it's going to be good. I had a starter that friend of mine made, D anyway, F uh, I had a friend that read a book on that C and, F um, I've, all my relatives my m, D you know, you probably read BACK TO EDEN or something, I don't know, we read a lot, I know people have read all those books C but, the, F um, they dr, they drilled a well, I don't know how many feet C but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be, C and so their water comes out, they live in Grand Prairie, C but it's, they live kind of in a, the planes go right over from D F W, C so it's not real developed, C and so they have a, probably half an acre, C and, yeah, C and they drilled this well C and the water comes out at thirtytwo degrees, C so <laughter> it's kinds of neat. Would that be healthier do, to do that, to drill your own fresh water well like that? F Uh, mainly, the, the books I read are, F uh, business related, or self improvement. F Um, I've got a, a, F uh, small company on the side that I, that I do things with, C so, F uh, a lot of the reading that I, I do has to do with, F um, how can I, F uh, do better at, at my smalltime business F uh, important issues such as a, D you know taxes and, business expenses and all those kind things. <Laughter>. F Um, I've got a, F uh, small distributorship, F uh. I, F uh, sell a, F uh, healthy cookie on the side. C And, F uh, I have a few health food stores that I send it to. I can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can, C so I can get a deal from the, F uh, from the ma, from the supplier, C and then I distributed them C and then I ca, I get, I can sell them at a cheaper price. Plus I've got a, F uh, drinking water system business that I've had on the side for years that I've done. A drinking water business, F uh, yeah , Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Sounds like it. F Um, I haven't really read anything like that in, in, in years. There was a time when I was really into the home things, C and I did, F uh, had my own garden C and I did canning, all those kind of things. That was when I was about, F uh, ten years younger C and F uh, I had, <Laughter>. About ten years younger, yeah. C And, F uh, F uh, th, the problem that I've had in the past with, F uh, my children growing up and moving out of the house and, and still having three left at home, out of the five, F um, I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in, in reading more and, and spending more time at the library C and it, I've been moderately successful, F uh, with my daughter and with my son, they both have different interests in books C but, F um, they, they, F uh, they do read them. F Um, <lipsmack> I have some books on, on health that I read all the time. One's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing, Yeah, I, I'm, Uhhuh. There's a, F uh, a couple called, F um, F oh, I'm going to forgot his name now, F uh, Dirkson, F um, C and, F uh, there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS, I don't know if you've ever heard of it, Okay. It's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS. There's also a book called THE LIFE EXTANS, EXTENSION COMPANION, F Uh, Dirk Pearson and, F oh, A I forgot Sally's last name, anyway it's a couple. I've, I've seen them on T V, C and, F uh, they an, they are pretty down to earth about F uh, <lipsmack> what you can take and, and what you can't take C and, F um, The quantities, what are good for you, what isn't C and, F Um, LIFE EXTENSIONS. F Uh, yeah, he's probably about forty years old now, I saw him probably seven years ago, on Johnny Carson show C and, F uh, I was pretty impressed. He had a, he, before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs D you know based on how well it was performing, C and then he embarked on this, F uh, vitamin treatment C and then every year he had the same tests run, C and at the age of thirtytwo, I think it was, his, F um, heart was that of a fourteen year old C and all the rest of his organs were all greatly, D you know, all tested out greatly below his actual age. C And, of course, Sally, F uh, isn't a very big woman, E I mean, she's, D you know, she appeared to me to be very petite C and F um, she took a horse shoe and, and turned it, turned it into an S, C and, F uh, it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that, that give you the strength, C and, of course, doing Isometric exercises, F uh, together they both exercised about five minutes a day, doing Isometrics rather than, D you know physical strenuous exercises. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Yes. Yeah, there's, I've, I've read a lot of things, F um, since I got involved in the water business back in eightythree, F um, C and it's amazing that the, the legislation they have, F um, for food that doesn't apply to water, they don't consider water a food C and, F uh, the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be, D you know, they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic <noise>. F Um, chlorine, It's toxic. It's a, I don't know if your on city water, city water has chlorine in it, chlorine, causes cancer, they know that, they've proven that. F Um, yet their saying D well we're putting such low doses in there, that, D well, you don't have to worry about dying from it. The problem is that I've, that I've read books that, F uh, have proven that <noise> there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis, which is heart attack, C and if you look at the history of hear attacks, heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty, C and we started doing, F um, large quantities of chlorination of water starting around, F uh, where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen <noise> most of the major cities had chlorinated water. Uhhuh. Yeah, I'm very familiar with the area. It depends, a lot of, F uh, a lot of things were thought <breathing> that, F uh, as, D you know, the farmers thought, D okay, we got chemicals, we're putting chemicals on the field, D well the ground will naturally filter out the <<End of document>>...
