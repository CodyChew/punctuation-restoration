<Hum> <noise> <<TV or radio heard faintly in background.>> Okay. I, I guess first of all I'll just say we haven't done much, F uh, gardening. We do lawn work all the time. C But, F uh, our gardening we lost, remember the last two freezes, I don't know how long you've been here <noise>. C But we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones. C And so, as far as our bushes, we don't have any C but we do have some blackberry bushes. C And C and they were really hearty and stayed on C and we've done really well with them. Uhhuh. Yeah. C And so they've been really good C and the kids, I <laughter> had to, the first year I had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries. C But, F uh, we go out, it, it's hard to go out when it's this hot. C And, F uh, C but, F uh, keep the weeds out of them and, and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them. C And they're okay. Yeah, F uh, <lipsmack>, Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, we have some flowers that have, they're just are real hearty also, C and they're bold C and they come up every year C but, F uh, they're getting too thick, I need to go thin them out. C And, F uh, there's a, I don't know what kind of flowers they are. They're real common around here. They're, they're orange C and they look like a lily, sort of. F Uh, Yeah. No, C but I think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in. They, they keep the, the rain on the outside, little rain drops C and, C and they look real pretty after the rain. C And so I really like them C but I need to get out and, and, F um, <lipsmack> do that. D Now as far as our grass, it grows crazy <laughter> here. It just keeps growing and growing C and, F uh, sometimes my husband does it C and sometimes my son does it. C But it just is, I don't, I don't know. I've lived in Utah my whole life C and we can't seem to get ours green. I don't know. Yeah <Lipsmack>. Uhhuh. Crappy <laughter> I know, we have that too. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh dear. <Breathing> No. <Breathing>. Uhhuh. Had somehow gotten in. <Lipsmack> <breathing>. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh. The, the other problem that we have, D well it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived <laughter> C and so I, I don't know. C So D like I wanted to go out and kill them too. They had no right to live. C But anyway, <laughter> F uh, under our trees we get a, a north sun C and, F uh, the, it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them. C And we just can't grow, F uh, grass underneath there. Uhhuh. Yeah. Right. It's a vicious cycle, isn't it? It just really, D Well, I don't, we've never done anything like this C but we've been thinking, D you know, if we built up, F uh, <lipsmack> D you know, C either a wood, wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it D like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some C either flowers, C or, C or some new bushes in there that would live. C And so I think that we're going to try that. I, I think the <<pause>>, I think that's pretty much what we have decided. D Now I have two long windows C and I'm trying to decide whether to put D like bushes in front of them or not. D You know, maybe just halfway up the window or something like that. So people can't see and hear too much <laughter>. Yeah. Yeah. That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows. One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son C and one is, F uh, <lipsmack> an office that my husband and I work in. C And so, I, I really <children_talking> don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that, D well, the flowers are out by the back of the house, C so, C and that's why the front room is. C So that's not too bad. C But, I like to look at the flowers. They're pretty. <Laughter> Yeah. C But it's funny because, F uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, A anyway I do, to do our yard C and then it's like the wind blows <<pause>> everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them C or C and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few <lipsmack> months it would all be back C and <sigh>, It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work. Uhhuh. I know. It is, it's not my favorite, thing in the world either. I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. D Well that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out, outside, C so, Yeah. <Laughter>. Right. Exactly. Exactly. <Noise> <<humming sound>>. Yeah I do <children>. F Oh, really. Did you plant those yourself? Oh. <Children>. Uhhuh. Oh. That's nice. I, I love blackberries C and we, F uh, when I was smaller, we, my family lived in Tennessee C and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick, my brother and I. C But, I don't have any down here. <Noise>. <Children> F Oh, I think I know what they, I can't remember what the name of them are either. Oh. <Breathing>. Down here, the grass? D Well, I'm, we've had problems with our yard. We, it was one big weed is what it was. It was just horrible. C And my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns C and we have this God awful ugly thing. C And C and I know they must think, <sigh> D you know, I wish those people would do something about their yard. C But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that, <breathing> that seems to be helping C and he put it on the front yard to see how, D you know, it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard. C But we've got a Great Dane in the back C and she has eaten everything I have put out there. She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees. I know, C and she's eaten the bushes. I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there C and I barricaded it up, so she couldn't get into it. C And I went and took a shower and looked back out there C and she was already in it. C And I was so mad. C So I can't do anything back there. Because she just, she destroys it. C But I've tried out in the front C but like you said that, that freeze that came. I had some bushes that, F uh, some shrubs I pu, put out front C and it killed those too. C So, I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing. I just don't even want to do anything. <Laughter> Yeah, that, that happened to us. We have these, I know. F Oh, I know. Ours don't. I know, we can't either. C But I've got pre, two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. F Uh, D you know one on either side of the yard. C And, C and they're big C and they're real full and everything, D you know, in the summer time C but it, it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree C but toward the end of the summer, D you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing. C But, by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops. D You know, it's, it's it's a never ending cycle. <Child>. Yeah, it really is. C So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot. C So, Uhhuh. <Noise> <<metal>>. Huh. Yeah. <Laughter> Really <child>. C, D well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front C and they've got miniblinds and stuff. C But only, only one is really D like <noise> in the flower bed part C and the other one is out on the porch. C So there's not really much I can do about that. Yeah. I do too, that's why I look at my neighbors yard <laughter>. I don't have anything to look at C so I look at theirs. Uhhuh <noise>. Yeah <Noise>. Yeah. It, it's really <noise> a pain. My husband works a lot C so, F um, a lot, Yeah <breathing>. I'm, it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard C and <<Pause>> C and I just <sigh> I really do not appreciate <laughter> having to go out there and do it. I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else. I hate to mow that yard. <Children>. Yeah, D well mine's getting there. He helps, <noise> he does half C and I do half, C so. Pretty soon, though, by next year he should be able to do it all by himself. Whether he likes it or not. <Child> F Oh sure I'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it <laughter>. and, and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it. That, that's my only thing with him. That's why I'm help, having him help me now <children> <<voices fade at end of tape>>.
