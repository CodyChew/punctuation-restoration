Okay. F Uh, read any good books lately? <Laughter>. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. F Uh, D well I'm in graduate school C and so I read a lot of books C but I don't know if I consider very many of them good <laughter>. F Uh, I haven't read a book for enjoyment since, I guess, around Christmas. F Uh, I <throat_clearing> re, received, F uh, F uh, several books for Christmas C and at Christmas break I read, F uh, SARUM by, F uh, F uh, a fellow named Rutherford. F Uh, it's the history of, F uh, D well it's sort of the his, the historical fiction about, F uh, the Salisbury area in, in England. C And so, I, I really enjoyed that book a lot. F Uh, he's not quite as good as, D you know, Michener or some of, F uh, some of the other historical writers. C But he, he did this job well, C so. Yeah. F Uh, do you find th, do you find you have much chance to read for, for just pleasure or mostly for business? Uhhuh. I don't think I have seen it. <Noise>. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Oh. Okay. I think I have heard about that. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, that sounds great. Did, did it have something to mention about, F uh, sort of, F uh, cultural rituals of, of manhood? Okay. Yeah, I have heard of that. I have, F uh, someone suggested that I read it. Is it IRON JOHN? Okay. Good. B L Y? Okay. Great. Uhhuh. F Uh, what are your favorite, F uh, do you have a favorite subject to read, whether it be science fiction or, or history C or, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. Okay. Uhhuh. That sounds great <laughter>. F Uh, who is your, whose your favorite religious author? Uhhuh. <Rustling>. Uhhuh. Max Lucado? <Noise>. Yeah. Yeah. F Uh, he's a great man. I've met him several times. F Uh, F Huh. F Uh Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Uh, yes, I, I've read, F uh, several good books lately. F Uh, lot of them related to, F uh, business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living. How about yourself? <Laughter>. Yes. Uhhuh. D Well, that sounds good. No, I read for pleasure some also. I read a book recently called IRON JOHN. Have you seen that by Bly? Okay. D Well it's a book about, F uh, F uh, Greek gods and, and Greek, F uh, mythology as well as, F uh, man and interacting with other men and a book about, F uh, men and how they mature through life. C And how they deal with life itself <sniffing>. C But it's, F uh, it's all revolved around, F uh, mythology. F Uh, as far as, F uh, traditions from, F uh, other cultures and our culture. And how we, F uh, interact with one another. Yes. Yes. By Bly, B L Y, I believe it is. Uhhuh. C And, F uh, it's a very interesting book. D Well, it depends again if we're talking about <laughter>, F uh, I read a lot of religious books. F Uh, just because I have an interest in that area. C And I read a lot of books in the area of, F uh, F uh, psychology and selfhelp type, F uh, materials. F Uh, always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business. C And, F uh, C so that, that's, my work is my hobby <laughter>. <Laughter> C So I, I enjoy it. D Well, I don't know if I have a favorite F uh, religious author. I would have to say that, F uh, some of the ones that consistently put out good materials, F uh, D you know, that, that's difficult because <lipsmack> one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well. F Uh, I had to stop here and think a second. One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books C and I thought that each one of his books were good. He's the man out of San Antonio. C And, F uh, Max Lucado. Max consistently writes good books. Yes. I know him, yeah. <Throat_clearing> C But F uh, there's other authors also that have F uh, F uh, that write good books from time to time, but not consistently put out the materials all the time <sniffing>. F Uh, I'd say another, which is a local writer here in Plano, F uh, is, F uh, I'm trying to think of his name. He's with the Bible church. C And that is, F uh, <<pause>>, I see his name C but I can't, E I mean I see him C but I can't see his name <laughter> <sniffing>. C But he, F uh, he talks about, F uh, he talks about a lot of different topics C and,
