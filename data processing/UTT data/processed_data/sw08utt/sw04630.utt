<Noise> F Uh, I basically, F uh, listen to the news from the T V. That's probably the only time <talking> I get a chance to, F uh, F uh, take a look at it is the evening news C and, C and then if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear something through news wise. C But, F uh, other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic <child_talking> happens and somebody tells me it about through, F uh, F uh, D you know, F uh, through conversation or whatever C but, F uh, most of the time it is through the news in the evening C so that's about the, Newspapers? No, I'm not too much in reading newspapers. F Uh, not that I don't enjoy <whistling> newspapers or anything like that C but, F uh, part of it is because I just don't <barking> feel like I need, the need to have them, F uh, with watching the T V or whatever. We get our weekly news around the area C and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest, F uh, in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state <dishes>. C But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, D you know, I get tons of, F uh, news coming in <whistling> that kind of stuff. F Oh, you do <laughter>? You read it in the morning then? Uhhuh. Sure. F Oh, sure <laughter>. To see if they did it or if they, F uh, criticize you or put something in there wrong. Sure, sure. <Child_talking> Uhhuh, Sure. Sure, exactly <talking>. Uhhuh, sure. D Well, that's, that's kind of like you said then. We, we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, F uh, while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on C and, F uh, very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock C so, by that time, D you know, old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever. C But, F uh, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on. C But, F uh, other than that, no. It's, Exactly, exactly, exactly, sure. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah. D Well it brought kind of, F uh, more of a vivid, F uh, look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things. C But, F uh, yeah, <talking> that's true. D You know <<faint>>, D you know a lot of people that read the news to, newspapers to get the news of what's going on C and, F uh, other people that, D you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all C so. C But, Exactly happens. Sure, sure. That's, F Oh sure, a clip, D you know, a sentence or two C and that's about it of what went on C and, F uh, they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time. Sure. Makes sense. <Laughter> Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. C So you're right on the coast line. You're not, F uh, further up. You're, Uhhuh. Sure. Sure. I suppose you watch for huri, hurricanes coming in and things like that. Sure. Yeah, that's about the only time in the, in the summer, F uh, if you're watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's going on, they'll kind of say, D well, there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever. This is the, what is expected, C but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically, F uh, so fast D you know, where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever C so. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure. <Laughter> to take off. Sure. Yeah. That's, sounds pretty good C so. Anyway, I don't know if our time is getting up here C or it's got to be fairly close to that <noise> <talking>, You don't get any newspapers? I'm kind of the opposite of you. I get all my news from newspapers. We have, we have two newspapers. Yeah. Two newspapers in the morning. C And, F uh I'm, F uh, in, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot C so, F uh, I, I kind of look through to see, see what, F uh, I'm quoted in. C But, F uh, how, how bad the quotes are every day. Yeah. C Or, F uh, sometimes there's, F uh, letter to the editor about me C or there's a, even, F uh, editorials for C and against what I'm doing <laughter>. C But, F uh, C but T V, F uh, the T V, I, I don't really watch, even if I'm, even if I'm on it. C But just, Right. C And that's, C N N had the, F uh, everybody was watching C N N, that seemed to be the place to be to find out what was going on on that. At that point, I was watching the T V. On something like that. D Well, the thing is, with, with T V, I, I, F uh, a lot of times the, the news on, F uh, the local T V is so brief, you really don't get the full picture of what, F uh, what's going on. C And, F uh, that's, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, F uh, idea of what's happening. C But, Right. C But I like the weather report. C So, I wa, I alway, always, I always turn that on that's one part I watch because of, F uh, I go surfing down here C and I always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good. Yeah. No. Right on the south Florida coast. Where the weather is still warm here. Yeah. Yeah. Weather channel's good <laughter> <<very faint>>. Yeah. I mostly look for the storms out in the ocean. F Uh, hundreds of miles out C so I can predict my, my week and where I'm going to be. C So I can be at the, at the beach when the waves start coming in.
