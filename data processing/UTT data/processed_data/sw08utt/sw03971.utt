Okay, C so what do you think of the Giants? Yeah. F Oh, yeah. Yeah wasn't that something of him. Yeah, that's really a, really proud of him though, the way he's, D you know. Yeah, really, D you know. Yeah, I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top D you know. Yeah, F um I was mostly an A s fan, D you know. I had been to more games at the A s than I have in the Giants because, F uh, I lived in Oakland D you know, for some time. C But, F uh, I still like the Giants, though, D you know <laughter>. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. Yeah, right, right. Yeah. Yeah, right. D Well, I prefer ba, F uh, football over baseball, C but, F uh. Yeah, it's. C So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie. F Huh. <Laughter>. Yeah, F um. D So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams? I know. Yeah, D well, the Giants are. <Laughter>. Yeah, makes you sick, doesn't it? <Laughter>. <Laughter> Yes. He's like a little bitty kid, F huh. Yeah <laughter>. Yeah, D well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like. D You know, F uh, they won't be that far away, C but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow. D You know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I know, isn't that something I couldn't believe that, F huh. Yeah, I just, it. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, I couldn't believe that, D you know. I don't, F uh, there was Braves in that chanting that they had. That would drive you up a wall. <Laughter>. <Laughter> D You know. Yeah, D well, you're right <laughter>. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. <Laughter>. F Oh, really? Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, right. No, F uh, they give you a list of things that you want, All right. F Uh, I like the Giants. They got, F uh, I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe, maybe three years ago really C so, F uh, C but I, I just like the Giants. I don't, I don't know why. I really got into them. I read, F uh, Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography C and, Yeah, that, that was incredible. The way he handled that entire situation, there. C But, I just think the Giants have a good team. They, they got all, D you know, they're, they're, they're real balanced out. They got real good pitching, C and they got the hitting to go along with it. C So. Yeah, they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, D you know. I don't really know what it is, C but, C but every team that's, that's really good seems, D you know, like the A s had, they had, they just had it all that one year. C So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, D you know, you good and the bad C but. It's, it's kind of hard. I still, basically, the, the, me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere, E I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams, C but since, no, me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams, C so we, F uh about, about the most baseball we get is C either T V C or we play it on Nintendo. We play R B I baseball on Nintendo C so. C So that's just, D you know, that's small town trying to make it through the not being around it really, C but. Yeah. Yeah, so do I, C but baseball is still you got, you got to do something when football ain't on. C So <laughter>, Yeah, exactly. This is America, C so. C But. F Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say. I haven't really, really, you have to just keep up with everything in the off season. It's kind of hard to do, at least, D you know, you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and, and all that, C but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it. They just, I don't, yeah I don't really know about the A s. I don't like the A s, F uh, matter of fact I can't stand the Oakland A s <laughter>. Just because they have, F uh, D you know, they've got their Jose Canseco and, and all the attitude that goes along with that, D you know. They kind of. Yeah. You hear what, you hear what, you hear what he did. He ramming his wife's car, C and I was like, yeah. Yeah, he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money. C So. That's just, D you know, C but. Yeah, I've heard, I've heard talk about that. Yeah, they're not going to be happy about it. C But I hope they can do good. E I mean, that's just, I think they're a good team. That just need that one, one little thing to push them over. I don't know exactly what it is. They got, they're pretty balanced out all the way through. It just might be the drive, D you know more than anything else, they just, they probably just need something to push them because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it. C Or somebody basically, maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it. Maybe that's what, D you know, that's what some teams need. Look at the Twins going from worst to first. Yeah, my roommate my roommate's a Twins fan, for forever, C so, he had his year this year, C so. We got pre, we, we got into that a whole bunch. That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure. C So I saw all seven games of that, C so. That was definitely worth watching. Yeah. <Laughter> Yeah they, every team with the Indians been doing that now. I can't figure out why. You have to figure out why they're all doing that, I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, D you know the Braves, Braves didn't win, C so, F uh, why keep on doing something that didn't work, C but I don't know. I was, I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball, C and I get a woman's voice. I was, I was, I was thinking, uhhuh, I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car, C so. Yeah, I got, I called, got a call the other night about, F uh, fixing your automobile up, C so. D Well, baseball's baseball. It's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick, do you pick the topic or does the computer?
