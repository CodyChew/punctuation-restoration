D So, the topic is vacations? I think so. I enjoy them. F Uh, the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents. It was, The last one was back down to Lubbock, Texas, to visit family. C But that's not the tradition for us. F Uh, we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year. Yeah. F Oh, Rocky Mountain National Park. It's, it's just like any of the other national parks. It, D you know, there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching C and, F Oh, it's, Yeah, we usually try and drive up there, F oh, once every year or two. Sure. To the top the of the peak, sure. F Oh, it's not bad at all. It's, it's a beautiful drive. D Now I admit up there, the altitude is kind of <<pause>> interesting, D You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy, C but it's fun. D You know, take along a picnic lunch C and, F Oh, we love it. F Uh, no, they're only to the east, F uh, E I mean to the west of us. Here in the Springs, D you know, it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies. D You know, C and once a week we drive up into the mountains, usually, D you know, usually once a week, once every other week. Yeah, D well, I enjoy hills, in Texas too. I've been in Sherman. No, I haven't, you? F Uh, once to Mexico City, C but just a little day thing on business. F Uh, that's nice. Did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy it? Uhhuh. F Uh, got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture C and, Oh. Huh. C So the place that I went, that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most, was Seattle. D Well, we, F uh, was, two years ago, we went during the drought. I'm sorry, three years ago. It had been dry for a whole week. It didn't rain for a whole week. Yeah, somehow we picked the right time and, F uh, walked down on the wharf, C and I think we ate seafood every meal for, D well, not quite every meal, but most meals for a week. F Uh, it was wonderful. F Uh, the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl really enjoyed. It's <<pause>> very interesting. Yeah. Yes. It was, it was super, C and, F uh, went to the Seattle Aquarium. C And it's right down there, on the, right there on the ocean, and <<pause>> down there on the wharf by the piers and all, C and you walk down in a dome, a glass dome, C and the bay is circulating over your head, C and you, C and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks C and F oh it's, Yeah, C and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, C and F oh, it's, it's amazing. F Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt. Seattle is beautiful, C and the mountains, the mountains to the east of Seattle, are just incredible. I rode a ferry for the first time in my life. D You know, up there, <<pause>> you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry, Instead of by bridge. C And you drive your car on. You park your car, you set your brake. You walk upstairs C and you have a beer, or coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day. It's amazing. Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah. C And there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, D you know, and drive, on to it, yeah, live on an island off, off shore from Seattle. C And, you, F uh, everyday they drive on the ferry. They go upstairs and have their morning coffee. Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and, D you know, depending on where it is. D Well, in some places, D you know, in some areas, D you know, depends on how far they are commuting. F Oh, it, it's strict, I'm, I'm a West Texan. Out there in the land of no water. C And, to think that people live on the water daily, is kind of odd to me. D You know, it's, it's a different life style than we are used to. F Oh, Galveston. Yes, I liked Galveston real well, F uh, <<pause>> there's, F uh, one of the areas down there close to Galveston is, I forget the name of the island, C but it's a bird sanctuary, with all kinds of wild birds. Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks and pelicans C and it's very pretty. F Uh, I like the Rio Grande Valley. Real well. Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone, to the, to the Alamo. Yeah, the river walk. F Oh, it's, C And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there. F Oh, it's just simply beautiful. C And, of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down to San Antone just, Yeah, C and go to, F uh, Lone Star, C and F uh, D you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery, C and. F Uh, El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way. D You know, go across the border and all. F Uh, the Davis Mountains are interesting, out there in West Texas. Yeah, yeah. F Uh, D now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter, because, <<pause>> there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be, it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up. D You know, whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at. It's most enjoyable, to get, D you know, to get warm. That's nice, F uh, down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting. I love the Texas Hill Country. C And, F uh, Austin is neat for, for an occasional visit. Yeah, yeah it's a fun few days. F Uh, F Oh, U T is real pretty. F Uh, there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area, Marble Falls and all. That's real pretty. F Uh, <ringing> I would say definitely go see that part C and, F uh, I'd say go to, F uh, Midland once, just for the heck of it. I don't know why, D exactly. C But, F uh, D you know, find out when they are holding <<pause>> the petroleum fair, F uh, Alright, that's a good, that's a good topic, F huh? <laughter>. Where did you go on your last vacation?
