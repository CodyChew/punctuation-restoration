Okay, I guess its recording. F Um, what kind of hobbies do you have? Do you sing or knit or anything? Okay. I, F uh, I started knitting awhile ago, I knitted I didn't know, even know what the stitch is called. I just had this, F uh, F uh, piece of yarn C and I wanted to start something C so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old <laughter>. C So I kept doing that, C and now I have a little blanket C but that's all I've done. F Uh. Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets? Uhhuh. Oh. I see. F Huh. Uhhuh. I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket <laughter>. I don't know why. It's just too time consuming. F Um, I like to sing. I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that. F Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter. C But, F uh, if I could do anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally. C But F um, Yes, uhhuh. I'm in, F uh, I work for channel six in Waco. C And so I do little news reports and things. It's not as exciting as it <laughter>, as it sounds. C But, F um, No, not much, F um, my day is usually pretty full. My schedule is like from nine to five thirty, C but I could be at work from anytime, D you know, from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever, C so it's hard to make plans much less, D you know, have a hobby. C And even if I had a hobby like knitting or something and I wanted to take it to work, I'd probably never get to it. D You know, C so. What do you do? Normally. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh <throat_clearing>. Uhhuh. Oh. Right. I show, I showed mine to my boyfriend C and he was like, you didn't make that. F Oh, yeah, it looks, F uh, halfway decent D actually, <laughter> first thing I did C but, Yeah. How many children do you have? F Oh, okay. I hear them in the background there. All right, that's a hobby in itself. <Laughter> A job in itself. <Laughter> Right now I was just sitting here watching T V, I was getting ready to fall asleep. Yeah, I sang at one last summer. F Um, it was my first wedding. I've done, F um, little commercials and background singing C and, F um, I sang all through college and things like that C but I really haven't done anything really, professional per se. C But I did one wedding last year C and, F uh, I just now got some cards together, kind of, F uh, business cards that say, singer, C and what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or something, C and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops, E I mean when someone comes in, D you know, for a wedding, for a wedding dress, and they, they might ask about it. This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, D you know, if any one wants to listen. C And, F uh, she wanted me to bring it in, she's going to play it on Saturday C so <laughter> that would be great, if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice, C but, <breathing>. I haven't got any calls, yet C but I only just put them out this week C so, hopefully I'll get some calls in. Especially now since this, it's spring C and it's the wedding season, I guess. Uhhuh. Yeah, that would be great. Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do. Not that I don't like reporting, C but, I'd love it. <Throat_clearing>. No, I've never, I've never had, F uh, formal training. I've just been singing every chance I get. I try, D you know, in school C and, yeah, choirs C and, F um, when I was at U T, I was in a group called Ensemble One oh Nine, just twelve singers C and we did, F uh, little conventions and, F um, F uh, like dinner parties and things like that. Sing pop music. C So, that's what got me really, really interested in it. C So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time. Yeah, exactly. My parents would have a fit probably. C But, F uh, I think, I C either have a call C or, yeah, I do have a call, hold on one second. Hello. Yes, okay that's my mother on the other line, I need to go, C but, F um, I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to hear a beep or anything? F Oh, okay, my mother said ten minutes C so, I don't know. C But, F uh, okay D well, it was nice talking to you C and, C and good luck with your hobbies <laughter>. Thanks, bye. D Well, I, F um, I do crossstitch C and I enjoy reading and playing softball. F Oh, really. D Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, F um, made a few things C but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how <laughter>. D Well, if I remember I think we made some, D like Christmas stockings, you could make the, D like the granny squares or whatever, and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that. Nothing as big as a blanket. I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that. C And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff C but, <Laughter>. Yeah, do you have any other hobbies? F Oh, D well that's good. C So are you on the T V then? Oh. F Oh, okay. <Laughter>. C So you don't have too much time for hobbies? Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. F Um. I'm a housewife. C So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either <laughter>. C But I've made a, F um, few things, crossstitch things. I really enjoy doing that. C And F um, I made, F uh, D like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that, type of thing, C and it just takes a long time to get it done C but, D you know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to, to see it. Really? <laughter>. I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long <noise>. Two. Yeah <laughter>. Not quite <laughter>. It's a fulltime job, yeah. C So, F um, have you sang at any weddings yet? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's a good place, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah <laughter>. D Well, that's good. Yeah. F Oh, that's true. Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, F huh? Yeah <laughter>. Did you have training in singing when you were, younger then C or, Choirs and that kind of stuff? F Huh. D Well, that's nice. Uhhuh. Yeah, not just give up your job and jump right into it <laughter>. <Laughter>. Uhhuh <children_talking> <noise>. <<Long pause in conversation.>> Yes. Oh. I don't know, I've only done this one other time C and I thought that the man told me five minutes. F Oh, okay. It was nice talking to you, too, good luck with your singing. Okay, bye.
