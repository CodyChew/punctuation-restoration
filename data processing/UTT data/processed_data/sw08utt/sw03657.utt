Okay Jerry. I guess, F uh, tonight's topic is about, F uh, personal computers and level of interest and, F uh, and your, your expertise. <Laughter>. F Oh, D well. Okay. D Well, first of all, you want me to start off? Okay, real, real fine. F Uh, first of all, F uh, yes, F uh, I do own a P C here at home C and I also have one at the office. C And my level of interest is quite high with P C s C and I was really, I am really interested in them, however, not to the extent as I was about, F uh, two years ago when I basically knew about everything there was to know about different things C and that was the time when we were shopping for one. C And I think we got a top of the line at that time, C but, F uh, as you know P C s change quite rapidly C and the technological advances kind of outdated our P C where I can get the same P C I got two years ago at the fraction of the cost. C And I also enjoy using ours at home C and we use it for a, a number of different things. Plus I get in a lot, an awful lot of good use of one at work, where I work. Lot of, F uh, analytical, F uh, testing, reviews, F uh, lot of different things I use it at h, at work, C so I enjoy P C s C and they, they make my w, life and my work a lot easier. How about yourself? Uhhuh. Wow. All right. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Laughter>. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, yes. Sounds like you're an expert at it, too. <Laughter>. Yes. F Oh, D well, D well. <Laughter>. D Well, that's great, be, Uhhuh. Right. Great. We do an awful lot of that, too <laughter> with ours. <Laughter>. F Oh, yes. Definitely agree with that. <Laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Wow, wow, you got, that's a Four EightySix processor, too? Wow <laughter>. That's, Yes. Yes. Has to s, you have to have that to support UNIX. Uhhuh, of RAM. Right <laughter>. Yeah. Wow, okay. D Well, good for her <laughter>. You say she's a programmer also. Uhhuh. D Well, great. D Well, she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work. Ok, <Laughter> Oops <laughter>. F Oh, D well. D Well, okay, D well, let's, let's fire away. F Uh, D well, Brian, Yeah, why don't you, why don't we, why don't you do about thirty seconds C and I'll do thirty seconds C and then we can work off of there. D Well, F uh, since, F uh, D well, I guess since this time last year I've changed, F uh, jobs within the firm I'm with <Lipsmack> C and, F uh, I now am learning to be a sys admin on, on, not only P C s, but, F uh, pers, F uh, professional work stations as well. C And these are the big mamas, i. e. sons, F uh, Hewlett Packards, F uh F uh, sor, F uh, <lipsmack> F oh, the big Solburns and, and so forth. C And, F uh, <breathing> h, C and, C and, F uh, we have, F uh, two P C s here. We have, F uh, an X T C and then recently we, we made a, the command decision to go ahead and get, F uh, the absolute top of the line because spouse is a, F uh, programmer. C And so we got one that, that could do enough, F uh, and, D you know, hold three different O S s. As far as DOS, F uh, UNIX, and, F uh, O S Two. <Laughter> C So, F uh, I, I get to see all kinds of different applications. No, no. Learning, I'm learning t, I'm learning to be, F uh, one who knows what's he's doing C but, expert, no <laughter>. I frown on that, that term because, F uh, too many people, s, D you know, F uh, misuse the word C so, I'd rather say I'm, I, I am continually learning, C but my area, m, my level of expertise is increasing almost daily. C And, F uh, yeah, C so, I've got a P C and a work station at work C and I C and we have two P C s here w, at home. C And the, a lot of the, the, the new mama we're, F uh, I've got Aldus and, F uh, Micrographics on it as far as, F uh, technical publishing C and we do a, quite a bit of church work with ours. C And, F uh, D You know, some, I, I, I've found that, F uh, the more we do with it, F uh, it seem, C and the Lord's just pleased that we're kind of, this is, this is, part of giving back a portion of what He's given to us. C So, F uh, I don't mind, because seems like the more we do, there's, there's the more stuff that's, F uh, available that comes along and so forth. C And, C So, F uh, rather than being niggardly and, and, chintzy, F uh, we've just said, you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, F uh, enabled us to get the money to buy the Four EightySix. C Because the top of the line we've got, D well, we've got a compatible. It, F uh, Eight meg of ram and, and two, two, two hundred and eleven hard drives. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Like I said we bought a real steam, steam burner. F Uh, mainly because of spouse's UNIX because UNIX takes a, a, c, a D well, four megs minimum of RAM C and then, F uh, it, it, it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive. C So the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven C and so rather than just have one, we went ahead and got two. F Uh, at some point in time I'm going to do the mirroring, F uh, experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for fault tolerance. C And, F uh, F oh, speak, speak of the angel, she just walked in <yelling>. T I stuff <<to another person>>. C So, F uh, F uh, Yeah, she's, she's a squirrel for, F uh, F uh, contractor out at American Airlines. C So,
