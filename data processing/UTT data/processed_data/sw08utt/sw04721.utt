<Swallowing> <talking> You want to go first <laughter>. Really? D Well, yeah, I do a lot of exercise. Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which I absolutely love. F Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years C and I wanted to get it back off C and I was going through a divorce C and I just found that running really made me feel good. Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day C and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike C and, F uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it C and it was really helpful at the time. D Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then <noise> in the gym doing this in one place. C And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. C And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it C and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, C so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot. It is, it's aerobics C but it's with dance steps. It's an aerobic exercise C and it's an hour straight. C And it's just, F uh, it's a lot of fun. I feel like I'm not just exercising. Because I'm dancing C and I'm, I'm getting much better. My stamina is getting great for the dance floor <laughter>, C so E I mean it's just, there's a lot of positive things with it, C so. It is inside C and I've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having C and I just enjoy that much more too than inside. I have a thirteen year old daughter C and so we go bike riding C and it's nice. We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework. C So I've enjoyed that part of it. Yeah. C And at the gym, even in the class, F uh, I, w, e, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. Everybody's on their way to someplace C and so, D you know, I do have one friend who goes occasionally C but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty <laughter>, C so. There are, there are. It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah. You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V C but i, you probably wouldn't. D So. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I can see it'll be a good break. Right. Uhhuh <<faint>>. Yeah <<faint>>. Yeah. I think you do. You feel very good after you exercise. I think it's worth making the time for yourself. You owe it to yourself <noise> C and I think you do accomplish <noise> more after that. C And I think that it's just is good for your selfesteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better C and it's just, F uh, I think it's well worth it. I just demand that time for myself. D Now I've learned to do that C and, D you know, C and it's, I think it just benefits you all around. C So. You have to. Because there's always more things to do. There is always things that you can make priority to it C but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself C and so D you know, I just feel entitled to it C and I take it <laughter>, C so. <Sigh> No, I've done some walking with friends in the past. C But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise C and that's not really beneficial, C so, F uh I don't have time like that C and I spend enough time chatting around <laughter> everywhere, D you know <talking>. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, F uh, no I don, I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or as I would like to, F uh, F uh, these days. I, seems to be to easy to get busy with other things. F Uh, I have, in the past, F uh, jogged and, and run, C and every, every January and every September, I start out again C and then it tapers off <laughter>. F Uh, what about you? Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. <Snorting>. D Well D now that, is that, F uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, F uh,, Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. D Well, F uh, okay. Now that's inside again, right? C But, Do, do you like to do it wi, with other people. E I mean like the, the jazzercise would be? Yeah. Yeah. Right. C But, Yeah, right. Right. C But still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing. In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, F uh, that makes a difference doesn't it? I, I've, one thing, when, when I have <swallowing> run and jogged, F uh, I've always enjoyed doing it by myself C and, C and, kno, not with the sense that it was, F uh, F uh, chore or something that I was having to do, I, I've really enjoyed just the activity C and, F uh, <sigh> I write software, F uh, as far as the job C and so getting out and being active, F uh, is, F uh, F uh, helps out. The, th, it's The ch, the chan, the change of pace and just getting out and around C and I find that I can often, D you know, often, F uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work C and, F uh, F uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working C and I, I go back C and I've got new ideas, C but still. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's, F uh, I think that's a good term, d, demanding the time for yourself. That you've just got to you've just got to prior, Right. Yeah. D Well good, D well good. D Well, F uh, F uh, have you, have you done any jogging? I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, F uh, club. Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. <Laughter>.
