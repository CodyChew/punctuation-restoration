<Noise> <<piano in background>> Okay. F Um, I get my current events basically from news, F uh, just because I watch, pretty much a lot of television, F um, F Uh, I watch a little bit of everything. I like to tune into, to C N N because, F uh, D you know, you can tune in D like any time of day and pretty much get the update on, everything, in about five or ten minutes. I think news today, F um, it's kind of losing its importance. D Like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds. D You know, really quickly, on regular stations. Yeah, that's good, too, uhhuh. I like K R L D. Uhhuh. Yeah, where do you go to school? F Oh, Okay. I went to U T at Austin. C But, F uh, I'm a news reporter C so I, <laughter> I should get all I can, my news from the new, from the T V. C But, F um, Yeah, I usually don't intentionally. Although I should, I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news. C Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news. If it comes on, I just happen to hear it. D Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa, to, <noise> <<piano in background>> to look at the news. C But other, Yeah, that's true. <Laughter> That's about it. The Sunday paper, it's so full of stuff, C but you pick your favorite section, C and the rest, you throw away. Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it C but, Uhhuh. Yeah. Is it, is it pretty good coverage on there? Yeah, yeah. F Um. C Because I find like on K R L D, I like to listen to that, C but each story is D like no more than two or three lines, D you know. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, that would probably be better. Especially when you look for the, D like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent. They have little, little, teenyweeny news, breaks, D you know. Yeah, yeah, basically. Yeah. C So let's see, F um, Uhhuh. The only reason I get trade journals is D like if I'm looking for a job or something <laughter>. Which is what I'm doing now. C But, F um, Yeah, <laughter> trying to get out of wherever they are C but, F um, I think, I think news is, I'm wondering where it's going. You know how, I think it will be nonex, pretty much <breathing> nonexistent except maybe through the paper. I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news. C And now, it's, it's kind of your final choice. You watch, first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that. C And I think it, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So much more effort. Yeah. Yeah. C But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again. I don't, D well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio. You still, you have two or three, I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations. C And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten. C And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in, True, yeah. True. That's true, too, yeah. Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper. One thing I like about the paper, F um, as opposed <noise> <<piano in background>> to television is that, F uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it. That's all you have time for. Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side, C and, C and every point they make, D you know. And, and it's all there. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, C because that's what we do. E I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, D you know. C So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time. C So, C and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think. I don't know. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah. I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news, C and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, D you know. Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it. Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. C Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they could tell us. C So all we had to sit here and, and ask is D well, what aren't they telling us, D you know. C So that, that was pretty scary. C But we, I talked to one woman, C and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, D you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on. C And at the same time, I talked to another woman, C and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam. C And she didn't know what was happening at that time. C And she was so happy to get the information, D you know. C So there's just a lot of different opinions on that. C But, Yeah. <Laughter>. C And then, too, a lot of times I think, F uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion. D Like, D You know, D like this Kennedy thing. <Clicking> <<sounds like a keyboard>> It's just, E I mean, everywhere you turn. Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy. D You know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night? C And D you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous. D So, C But what are you doing? Sitting on a computer? <Laughter> I heard the little clicking. F Oh, okay. D Well, it was nice talking to you. Okay. Take care. Uhhuh, bye. Okay. I guess we're set. Current events. Television news? Is it, F uh, C N N or HEADLINE NEWS or just local, news C or, Right. Right. Right. D Well, on commercial radio, I guess, I, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work, or evening on the way to school C so, C So, I don't, F uh, I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school, C but I do here. F Uh, University of Texas at Dallas. Right. Really. I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play, and listen, C but, F uh, Right. Yeah, all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper C so, I read the comics. That's about it, yeah. Right. Right. I like to listen to, F uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, I don't know, it's variety, C and now, they're throwing in a little news and a little bit of other stuff. It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour. Yeah, it usually is. They throw in a lot of, D you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries. It's kind of like getting a newspaper. There's a lot of sections to it C and they, they present different sides of things. F Oh, D well they spend a little more time, D you know, they cover the headlines, C and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and, interviewing people. C And it's, Yeah. <Laughter>. Yeah, C and only in the morning, I guess, there's a little bit. I haven't listened to a <breathing> top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know. D So, C And I guess I get some kinds of other, D you know, business related news through trade journals and things C but, F Uh, Right <laughter>. Yeah, a lot of people are. Yeah, where nobody wants, to sit down and read. It's, it takes a lot more time to read something, C and you've got news, bombarding you from everywhere now. D You know you, turn on the T V, turn on the radio. Why is that? Yeah, I just, I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, E I mean, just given the way society is. C And I enjoy reading, C but most people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and, flip through the channels, D you know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of, Right. C And they don't have to go get one, D you know. Right. Right. Right. D Well, that's why I like, F uh, national public radio because they get on one of these little things, they give you headlines that are brief, just, they touch on what's going on. C And then they'll get into something and really explore it. C And it's, it's informative. It's a lot more informative than, D you know, quick, half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear. Right. Yeah, there's so much going on in the world. Communication, D you know, expands the world now. There's too much going on. You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there. Yeah. C And the question is, how much of it E or how, some of it, I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing. Is it, is it the true story C or is it a little bit biased. Right. Right. I, I, D you know, I like to, to know what's going on. Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much. D You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News C and it will play over and over <laughter>, C and you just tune it out because it's the same thing C but, Yeah, they tend to, dramatize things. Yeah. D Like who cares? Really. D Well, Yeah. Trying to do some C programming. Okay <breathing>. Take care. Byebye.
