Okay, D well, F uh, some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things where I've, where I've, F um, learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas C and they were really, F uh, helpful, because I didn't know how to do this one stitching, C and so, that was very helpful to me as far as books. Otherwise, F um, I like to read children's books, and things like that. What about you? Oh. F Um. Uhhuh. Oh. Uhhuh. It's interesting that you said that. My husband and I had, F uh, took a book out of the library about gardening, too, and started a garden, a fall garden. F Um, F Oh, <laughter>, Yeah, C and our, our, F uh, cantaloupes and, and, F um, peppers and tomatoes are on right now, C so it's been really fun, C and, C and we learned that, D you know, F um, some of the gardening skills we had were before, C but, some of them we learned from a book C and so that was helpful to us. D Now, I've read two books <lipsmack>, F uh, that were, F uh, nonfiction lately C and, F uh, I, D well, one was nonfiction and one was fiction, C and the fiction one, F uh, was about a boy in, F uh, during the time of Adolf Hitler C and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp C and that was not enjoyment <laughter>. That, that was too realistic and really, F um, mind, a real eye opener, F uh, C and I guess it's good to read those things, too. F Uh, C but, I didn't enjoy it necessarily C and, F uh, the other one was quite enjoyable. It was, F uh, about a, a Chinese lady and her generations down, her, what happened to her family through the years C so, that one was good. I think all of, D well, even if they're not enjoyable, they bring you a, F uh, some kind of, of learning, C so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that. C So, I, I, I like to read the, the children's books, I think that's the most animated and imaginative. C So I like those a lot. F Oh, there are a couple of Newberry Award winners. F Uh, A WRINKLE IN TIME is one I don't know if you've ever read that C but, C but, F um, F oh, there's one about an Indian girl, C and I can't think of that, ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS is another C and that's a good one. D Now, some of the ones that have just received the awards this year, I haven't read, C and I would like to read those C but, F uh, it's funny, because I've read some from like nineteen twentythree and nineteen fortyfive and things like that C and I didn't enjoy those as much, C and I don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what, C but, F uh, Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, even that's good. Uhhuh. Yeah, F uh, my children and I, F uh, I started a thing where I read a book with them before they went to bed at night. C And there was one called THE PIG PRINCESS, C and it was a, a princess from a long, long, time ago, C and she came through a, a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig, F um, sty, C and the people that she came to were just farm people C and she didn't understand them, C and they didn't understand her, C but it came together in this book, C and it was really a lot of fun. Uhhuh. F Oh, goodness, D well I was an English major, C so I like to read period. F Uh, lately, I've been, on the whole, very practical, C and, F uh, I'm trying, F um, to, to, F uh, furnish a home C so I've been looking at, A I'm not sure reading is the word, but looking at books on, F uh, antiques and paintings and, F uh, interior decoration hints and, F uh, lots of books on plants and, and, and gardens, because we started a garden and things, things like that. C So I've been doing very little reading, except I, I did finally dip into a couple of biographies. F Um, all of sort of literary figures of this century. Oh. Good for you. I haven't gotten around to that. Uhhuh. Yes. F Um. F Um. <Laughter> No. Uhhuh. Oh. F Uh, what are your favorite children's books? Uhhuh. No. F Um. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's interesting, I, I, I, D well, you can't be an English major unless you like reading things from the past, C So, I've read a great deal of old things. I tend to go, go back, I don't have any children C so I don't read the new ones, C but I occasionally, if no one's looking dip into something like WINNIE THE POOH, <Laughter>. Or, F uh, F uh, the GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES or something like that F um, just because it's sheer magic. Uhhuh. Yes. Yes, I think that, F uh, we, we,
