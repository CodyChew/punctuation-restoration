F Um, serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it. F Uh, D Well, I, that's funny because I just, F um, quit my job to stay home with my kids. C And, F um, I was a teacher for seven years in the public schools, C so I know a little bit about it not, a whole great deal. <Laughter>. D Well, F um, there, there's some. There's several <laughter>. It's such a, a broad, D you know, topic that y, you need to boil it down. C But, F um, one that, F um, I thought was a problem that, I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, F uh, was D like bilingual education for, F um, different, F um, minority groups and like Asians and, F um, F uh, Mexican Americans and, and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they <child_talking>, and in this area, C and, F um, as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages C and so most of these children are put in, F um, C either special ed C or a bilingual program, and then for just a small amount of time, C and then they're into their <child_talking> regular classrooms the remaining of the, part of the day, C and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English. C And so, F um, a lot of the money isn't put into that, C and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner C and, F um, <child_talking> D you know, there's only so long you can do that C and, to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts. C And a lot of the teachers, it n, it was not the teacher's fault. A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children <<faint>>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. F Oh, yeah. F Oh, definitely, definitely. C And it, C and it teaches language too. Which is really good. F Um, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, definitely, yeah. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. D Well, I know Richardson school district has a, has a wonderful program in the remedial reading, F um, where, D you know, of course, all the children are tested in some, time portion of the year C and, C and, F uh, some children who need extra help are put into this, F um, reading program, C and it is just excellent. It is, I wish that all the children could be exposed to that program, D you know. C And I kn, I know that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in that, C and yet they don't qualify, C but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify, because I think everybody would benefit from these programs. It is excellent C so, I have two little ones C and, that's why I, I quit my job. F Uh, D you know, I've been teaching since they were, gosh, newborns C and <child_yelling> C and it just wasn't adding up C and, D you know, being a teacher, and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just, D you know, don't have the time, time, time, time. It was kind of getting to me, where, where I'm doing the same thing <laughter>. C And so, F um, D you know, my children are getting older C and I was missing out on a lot, C so I just decided to stay home for a while, I don't know how long <laughter> <child_talking>. All right. D Well, what do you think? Oh. <Laughter>. D Well, tell me about it. What are, what are the problems with public education? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. <Noise>. Right. Uhhuh. Right. Do you find that those parents, F um, I've seen the same thing and heard the same things, C and at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend, D you know, that, that time, D you know typically the mother was at home with, F uh, the children and, and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on, C and really society sort of dictates that, F uh, D you know, both the parents work. C And, F um, I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the, D you know, the second and third grade, F uh, if the kids had, D you know, proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that, that would make a lot of difference. Yeah. D Well, I work at a university, C and, C and it's really tough when we're, F uh, F uh, I, I, F uh, work at the University of Texas at Dallas C and, F uh, we have, F uh, some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen. C And, D you know, there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class, even some who are maybe, D you know, in the top ten o, of their class, C and their S A T scores are very low, C and a lot of it has to do with their, F uh, <squeak> their reading ability, D you know, their, their language C and, It, F uh, makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low, they may be, F uh, good students, C but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential C and they're going, to fail unless some sort of remedial, F uh, education is given to them C so, C And then it, then it comes into, D well, who's supposed to give it to them, the colleges and universities or, are they supposed to get that <laughter> back in the high schools and, the junior highs. <Noise>. <Talking>. Yeah <talking>. Yeah, it sounds like it. D So how many children do you have at home? Oh. Yeah. <Laughter>. D Well, that's good.
