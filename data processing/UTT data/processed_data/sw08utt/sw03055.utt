C And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something, F um. Are you one who gives dinner parties very often? No, nor am I. They are a lot of work, that is for sure. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Right, yes. Uhhuh. F Oh, that's great. You sound like my mother who has been, D well I bake pies too, C but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family C and <sigh> she has the same, the same technique, E I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just, kind of do it second nature. F Uh. She enjoyed it, F huh <laughter>. D Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies, C and, F uh, we had a, a, <throat_clearing> an auction one time at the church <throat_clearing> E excuse me, C and, F uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars <laughter>. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, I think I, I have had it once C and it has been a few years ago, C but I do recall that it was quite good, C so, F uh, Yeah. C So, that is her specialty, F uh, I like to bake, F uh, also, I do not bake so much now that my children are grown, C but I do enjoy baking C and I guess I always liked making, F uh, cookies and bars and things like that, that was more my specialty, I suppose. C And they seem to last longer than pies around here <laughter> pies would go practically, in a day's time <laughter>. Yes. Right <laughter>. C And, D Well, it is interesting that, yesterday, I had lunch with a friend C and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers. For, F um, F uh, one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town C and, F uh, they invited two other couples over C and so there were seven of them that, F uh, I said D "well, what did you have" C and she said what she had, F uh, just Mexican food, C but, D you know, she had, F uh, F uh, guacamole C and, F uh, I cannot remember all she had. C But she also had made, F uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think. Have you ever made that or had it? It's, F uh, it's, F um, I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, F uh, it's just a wonderful dessert. It's like, F uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it. C And it's, it's quite, D actually, not very difficult to make, C but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it. C But, F uh, she said that she and her husband had, F uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago. C And, C and flan is almost, F uh, a basic with every meal that you get, there. Yeah, uhhuh. It's just very customary to get flan. C So if you ever run into that <laughter> you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about. C But, F uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner, C but, D you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that. C But <throat_clearing>, flan is something you can, make ahead and have just, D you know, have ready C but, F uh. D Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon, C but I tell you it, th, I my it's one of those things where it does require some real, F uh, planning C and, it's, D you know, you don't just make the dinner, you have the house to clean and, D you know, the whole business that goes with it. Yeah. Probably a good way to do it. <laughter> F Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party <laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. Oh. Good heavens <laughter>. <Laughter>. F Uh. F Oh, wow. That is such a nice thing, it's, <Sigh> I, D you know, until, D well we have, my husband and I have been married twenty six years, C and until last year I had never had another person clean my house, C and, then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then". C And so, I had a woman come in, F uh, once a month, C and D you know, it was not just very often, C but for me it was wonderful <laughter>. D Well, it is, C and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess. C So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned, C but, <sigh> D well, F uh, I, Uhhuh. I have heard about that. C but I have never tried it. No, D well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it, I do not know that it has egg in it. uhhuh. Do you have it right on the top of you head? <laughter>. You do not have it, yeah. I would, Uhhuh. Right. F Uh, quite large, yeah. Right. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Uh, what is it about the, F uh, the vinegar that, F uh, makes, the crust better. F Uh. Interesting. Yeah, yeah, D boy, that, that's the real secret. <Laughter>. F Oh, th, it makes me think of years ago, F uh, when I was visiting my motherinlaw in, F uh, Michigan, she lived very near an apple orchard C and we just had, we could take as many apples as we wanted from it. Accor, D you know, according to the owners, C and so <sigh> I decided to bake about four pies ahead, D you know, and freeze them, D well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be tough. <laughter> Those were the toughest apple crust, E or apple, F uh, pie crust, I have ever, ever made. It was terrible. I, I could have used that recipe, it sounds like. Where about? D Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years, F uh, Yeah. In fact, I, we were there from, F uh, seventy three to seventy seven C and, I was, I worked for the little, the weekly newspaper there, the, the Plymouth, A F oh what was it called, CRIER. <sigh> C And, F uh, my husband is from the upper peninsula, C so he was born and, raised up there. That is where my motherinlaw still lives, C so, F uh. Are you originally from Michigan C or, Uhhuh. I will be darn. Yes, uhhuh. sure. Right, No. <Laughter> I avoid them with all <laughter>, Yeah, they are, E I mean I do them, C but they are a lot of work. I usually have them when I, <sigh> there is a special event in our lives C and I, I make a big deal out of it for them. C And, F uh, I think I am most, F uh, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful. D You know, C and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust C and, D you know, I can make my pies from scratch, I do not need a recipe to follow. C And, F uh, Yeah, you just know from heart. I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie C and she said make me one, C and I made her one. C And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody". <laughter> C And I thought D whoa, <laughter> that was a big pie. Yes <laughter>. Uhhuh. My word, she must have a great pie recipe then. Wonderful. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah you, That's right, yeah they are meant for the, that evening's, dessert C and, D you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, D you know, the leftovers. Puts about two more inches on his waistline C and then he is <laughter> chastising, himself afterward <laughter>. Uhhuh. No, I have not, huhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Sure, yeah. Like apple pie in America, right. Uhhuh. Wow, uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, uhhuh. D Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, <Laughter> house clean <laughter>. Yeah, yeah, we are catering a wedding, F uh, F um, in August C and, F uh, this lady that is, it at, it's at her house, she is not a good housekeeper. C So she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready. Yes, C and there, D you know, she is, she must have found some jewels, because they start in the corner and work out. Yeah, C so, Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure, yeah that is nice, D you know, to have that, that's a, luxury, today. That's right, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it, Have you? . Egg and sugar. Uhhuh. F Uh, I, no, I think it would be too hazy, because, F um, the, I, F uh, no. D Well, it, D like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar, C and you mix that together C and then you, <sigh> D you know, your, D see it makes, it makes, F uh, five pie crusts at once. C So, that, it's quite a volume of, I think it's four cups of floor, C and, D like, F uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar C and, C and you combine your dry ingredients C and then you, F uh, put in your liquid. It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky, C and, <sigh> you can really treat it rough C and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust. D Like, F uh, it's not mine, it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, <sigh> twenty years ago C and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it C and, it will still be flaky. I thought, D wow, quite a statement for them to make. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow. Wow. <Laughter> D Well, I am from Michigan. Detroit, uhhuh. F Oh yeah, that's real close. Uhhuh. F Oh, how neat. F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes. Born in Detroit.
