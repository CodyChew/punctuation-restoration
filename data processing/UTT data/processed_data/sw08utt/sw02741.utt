All righty. I think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market. And for several reasons. Probably some of that is divorce C and some is they're more educated than they used to be I think. F Uh, I think sometimes, F uh, leaders in government they've become more, F uh, adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time. We have more women in government. <Lipsmack> C And, now I'll let you say something <laughter>. Very limited. Uhhuh. Yes. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Right. I think that's right. Uhhuh. Right. I really think women have so much more responsibility than, D you know, as far as everything. C And, like you said, F uh, one, women today have so many, F uh, the average today of having a, a single family, D you know, with the mother as the head, D you know, it just really, F uh, so commonplace, nowadays. Uhhuh. Right, right. Uhhuh. D You know, isn't that funny, F uh, because the same thing happened to us, except I was twelve. C And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession, C and was, isn't that funny? F Uh, but, just, that they were able to do it, D you know, C and even today I think the chance for education is j, is, is so much, F uh, better for all of our girls, and, and boys, too. C But, C but the girls especially. A lot of things, yeah. Right. Yeah. C And I also think that in the future that, F uh, it's going to continue. We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force. I think they're going to stay there C and I think that they're going to, F uh, F uh, be really responsible and, and do everything just like, what you said, D you know, make, make it the grade and, and make it so women can be the top people in their, in their field. F Oh, I think so. Right. <Laughter>. Right. Exactly. Exactly. That's right. C And I think that is happening more and more. I think it's just going to take a little bit longer. D Well, great, okay. Good to talk to you, Sally. Thanks. Byebye. Okay. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well, F uh, I probably a little bit older than you are, C so what I see, F uh, is, the change that I see the most is, is that, F uh, women have much more, many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I w, went to college. When I went to college <breathing> you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary, C or, C but there were very few women in business at that time. A few, C but they were the oddity. C And, Yes. C And now I see C and, C and I see for my daughter, which is wonderful <breathing> this, she's thirteen C and I see a whole <breathing> wonderful world out there that she can choose from, so many different jobs, which I think is terrific. C Because I'm a teacher C and, E I mean, I love teaching, C but, there, I think there are a lot of other things I would have liked better. C And, F uh, not that I would give the career up because it's, it's a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too, C and I n, I need the income. C But, F uh, C and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have, have started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must. F Uh, you just, it's very difficult to get along on one income unless <breathing>, F uh, the male, F uh, has an extraordinarily good job. C And <talking> especially men who teach school, they don't make that much money, C and, C and most all, they always C either have <breathing> they're C either moonlighting C or else their, their wife works, too. F Uh, it's just an economic need now. F Oh, definitely. Uhhuh. F Oh, yes, exactly. We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents C and, F uh, the majority is, F uh, married couple with children, C but still there's a lot more than there used to be. C And D see you never picture yourself in a situation like this. When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest of my life. C And, F uh, <breathing> C but I'm all, I'm really grateful that I went to college. My mother always said, D you know, get an education in case you need one, a, because my father died when we were, I have a twin sister C and we were eleven when he died C and she had a nursing degree, C and she was able to make it. C But, she said in j, you never know what's going to happen C and I thank God that I did go to college <breathing> and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children. Isn't that something. Yes. Yes. F Oh, yes. Yeah, I do, too. C But I think it needs to continue to change C and I m, I think it, there's still not equality as far as, F uh, paychecks for men and women. I think that the, we still have a long way to go. Uhhuh. C And I think that, F uh, I think by the year two thousand it, we're going to see some, a lot more changes, F uh, hopefully, that women are, D you know, able to get the, the executive jobs, and hold positions that men, <breathing> men do because they can do it just as well, D you know, if they want to dedicate their, most of their time to that they, they're, they can do it. Uhuh. Exactly. Exactly. C And I think that's the way it should be. I think it <breathing>, E I mean, not that I, I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, <breathing> could never do strength wise and so forth C but, also there's some things women can do <laughter> like have children, that men can't do. C So, D you know, it, I don't w, I don't want to be equal C but, I, I want to be, I want to get what I deserve C and I want to be able to be on the same level with them. If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay, D you know. C And, C And I just, I'm not a women's libber. I really am not. C But I, I think that <breathing> that we have just as many rights as they do. C And I feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she sh, they should get the job with the same pay. I do, too. F Oh, I do, too. Definitely <talking>. D Well, it was good to talk to you. All right. Byebye.
