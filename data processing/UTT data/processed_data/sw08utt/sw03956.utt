Okay. D Well, what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody? I think they should. I know I had a job until, let's see, a year ago this past December. I was working for P I E C and they closed, <sniffing> C and naturally while I was working for them I had health insurance, C but, F um, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me D like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at, at P I E. Right, it really is, C and I think, D you know, I think, F uh, D God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high. D Well, the thing is, D you know, jobs are so hard to find D you know, C and then, what you can get out here, in, D anyhow in the valley where I live at now, they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all. No benefits, D you know. F Um. Yes. E I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low C and, F uh. Yeah, C and they don't want, F uh, to pay any benefits, C so you just, D you know, pray to God that you don't get sick. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. No, I don't understand that either. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah. D Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor C and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, D you know, then I just sent cards in C and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine, C and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, D you know. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. F Um. Yeah, that's true, that's true there. D Well. Yeah, right. Uhhuh. C But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything, D you know, that, people that's on unemployment. I don't <laughter>. <Laughter>. Yeah, probably so. <laughter> I don't know, C but it is, it does seem to be a big problem, D you know. I don't know what they're going to come up with, C but, F um, I sure wish they would come up with, with something, C and, F uh, like I say, C and, C and I'm at the age, too, where the, I'll be fiftyseven in June, C and the people don't want to hire people this age any more. <sniffing> C And I worked for my previous company for twentysix years, D you know, C so, <sigh> it's kind of hard, <sniffing> D you know, C so. <Laughter>. Yeah, they'll be calling at my door, F huh. <laughter> C But D anyhow. Yeah, D now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, F uh, with this problem, because, it, D you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to <sniffing> ask him anything, costs you forty bucks D you know, just for the visit. C And then he, then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, D you know. C And he might tell you, D well, D you know, D now you're going to have to come back in a week, C and then that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you, Good grief. That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it? D Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, F uh, interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that. That might be a step in the right direction. I don't know. Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. You mean the, F uh, the employers? Uhhuh. Because everybody's competing for jobs. <Throat_clearing>. D Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do. I, I have to think about it some more now, because my doctor is, F uh, D actually he's Canadian C and, F uh, he told me that there're a lot of, F uh, lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here. I don't understand the arguments, exactly. He says it restricts your choice of doctors, and, and so forth. I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does. E I mean we're on a private insurance plan right now, F uh D actually I have my own business, C and C and we, our health insurance is through my wife's employer, C and, F uh, C and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can buy our medicine, C and, F uh, it changes every year <laughter>. It's always so confusing. C So. Uhhuh. D Well, yeah. Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the, F uh, the limits of, F uh, compensation, C but of course that is restricted choice, C so I don't think that the restricted choice really, F uh, has to do with the difference between, F uh, public and private health insurance. I think it has to do with the, the, the, F uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it C and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way, C so. D Well, F um I guess the most sensible thing I've heard about this is they say people are trying. You, you have to recognize that if you're going to <inhaling> have the very best health care possible and, F uh, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive. C And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, F uh, lavish. C And, F uh. Yeah, what happened to Reagan's safety net, anyway? Did he take that back to California with him? Using it for a trampoline now? Yeah, they'll be needing you in a couple of years, because they're running out of kids down that, the other end. C And. D Well, if they're smart. Uhhuh. Right.
