Laurie? Okay. I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your credit cards C and I'm supposed to compare those with my, my habits. Yes. Right. No, I do not. Uhhuh. F Oh, okay. Sure. D Well, myself I always, tr, I'm, I'm a traveling person C and I'm out of town quite a bit C so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work C and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything. C So that's, F uh, as far as using them outside that I'm not, I don't use them too much C but I, I think my wife is sort of like you she uses a credit card, most of the time. C So she does most of the shopping for our household C so she'll use them more than I will. Yes. C So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy <laughter> that always goes to like Dillard's C and I'll go in and charge something C and I'll have to give them my driver's license. They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card. C But I do carry D like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, D you know, primarily work type things. This is my first call by the way, C so <laughter>. F Oh, is it really? All right C so we're both beginners then. I've had this for a couple weeks C and I've been out of town C so this is my first time to, to use it. D So, No, I was given this topic. Yeah, they give you, they assign you a topic, you call the eight hundred number, Have you tried it yet? Okay. When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, F uh, pretty, F uh, cut and dried <laughter>. I'm not sure. A couple, about two minu, three minutes I think. C But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards. I, one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest. C And, F uh, D like years ago my wife and I got married she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit C and I was giving <laughter> everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that. That was like thirty years ago C so now it's a little different. We, I get a bill C and I'll pay it the same day it comes in. C Or at least I try to, C and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest C so they should follow the same rule. F Oh, you bet it's ju, it's an absolute savings. You bet. That's, that's very handy. D Well, I think that's all I have. Nice to meet you C and, F uh, give it a try. I think you'll enjoy it. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Yes. Okay. How do I make use of credit cards? F Um, let's see. I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash. C And I don, I, do you work for Texas Instruments? Okay. D Well, at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out C and those are only available at T I. C So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money C so I'm always using credit cards. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yeah, me too. <Laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. Uhhuh. C But do you get to pay the bills? <Laughter> Same at my house <laughter>. Uhhuh. Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. F Oh, it's mine too. <Laughter> Yes. Yeah. F Oh, okay. Okay. D Now, did you pick this topic C or were you given? I see. Okay. Right. No <laughter>. Huh, okay. F Um, let's see. C So how long are we supposed to talk for? Okay. F Oh, yes. Definitely. Uhhuh. <Laughter> Oh. That will cost you a fortune. Yes, yes. That's right. D Well, yeah, if you pay it that way it, E I mean, it really is, it's like getting a free loan for a while. Which is what I do. C Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in, you get to <laughter> keep the money. Yeah. It works great. Okay. D Well, it was nice to meet you. Okay. Thanks. Byebye.
