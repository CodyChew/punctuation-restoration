Okay. Okay, F um, the last movie I saw was the FIVE HEARTBEATS C and I liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it. Yeah it's, It's, it's, F uh, Robert Townsend movie. F Um, I, I don't know all the actors or anything, C but it was just, it was a lot of music a lot of old songs, things like that. F Um, it's still out now, F uh, it came out I guess about a month or, about a month and half ago, something like that. It's about a Black singing group. It, C and, F uh, it was called the DELLS, C And, F uh, it was kind of like just about their, their life, and their, F uh, history and things like that and the way they went from, from, how they went from stardom to nonstardom. C And, F uh, that was pretty good. I enjoyed, I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES. Have you seen that? Yeah, yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah, right now Kevin Costner, E I mean, he's starring in everything. He's doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out, F um, C and there's one, Yeah, yeah, starring Kevin Costner, C and let me see, what else. F Um, he's doing some other movie, I can't, I think ROBIN HOOD, that's it, the ROBIN HOOD coming out C and he's going to be in also. C And, let me see, what else have I seen. What have you seen? F Oh, I know what you're talking about. My. It's called REVIEWING MY LIFE, or something like that. Yeah, I didn't get to see that. Yeah, that's it, okay. Uhhuh. One of my favorite movies, it's not one that I haven't seen, I, w, it's not a late movie. It's, F uh, FATAL ATTRACTION <laughter>. It's probably my all time, D well not all time favorite, C but one of my favorites, that I can watch over and over. No, I never did, I, I heard it was really good, I've never, just haven't gone out to see it. Was that pretty funny? Yeah, yeah, somehow just never made it to see that, C but I need to see it. Yeah, FATAL ATTRACTION, that, I don't know why I like that movie so much, I guess it was so much suspense. C And I like suspense. Yes, uhhuh, yeah, on that order. Certainly is. C And I liked the woman that played in that, I forgot what her name is now. Anne Archer <<pause>> she's the one, she was the wife in FATAL ATTRACTION, yeah, C and she played in, F uh, narrow margin which was a little more recent, C and that was kind of another suspense type, Alfred Hitchcock type thriller. That was good. F Uh, God, I guess I haven't seen too many movies lately. I need to, Yeah. Uhhuh. Somehow, E I mean it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive, D you know, I'd, I'd rather rent. Yeah. Yeah C and that's just for a bok, a bucket of popcorn, D you know. Yeah, yeah, God forbid you should want something to drink with it, C but, F uh. Uhhuh. F Oh, yeah easily. C And you're usually going to do, you're usually going to go to a dinner, go to dinner or something with that. Yeah. It's almost more fun D really, yeah, it's almost more fun really to rent movies. D You know, just kind of stay at home, maybe. Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, C but then you can make your popcorn and D you know, be comfortable. Uhhuh. D Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently <laughter>. Uhhuh. No, I never did. Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger? Yeah, yeah. There's a movie I do want to see, F uh, I haven't seen it, what is it, F oh, KISS BEFORE DYING. It looks, it looks pretty suspenseful. <Clicking>. Are you looking in the paper? Oh. F Oh, yeah, that was great. Yes, that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too, that was an excellent movie. It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital, F uh, near to where I live C and they were saying that some of the patients there, you can't leave by themselves, because they'll make a weapon out of anything, D you know, out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody, D you know. C And this guy in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lector, he was, he was that kind of person, C and you, they couldn't leave him alone C and that's, that's what was so scary about the movie, D you know. Because he was such an awesome character, D you know, it was, it was really fas, he was very dangerous, C but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating. C But, C but they couldn't leave him alone at all. C And they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time, C but I won't tell you that, just in case you see the movie. Uhhuh, F oh very good. F Oh yeah, F oh yeah. I'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores, it should be a while yet, though. F Oh, I haven't heard anything about it. I, C but I don't like Steven Seagal things, F uh, <laughter> C so. He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE C and there was one right before that with a similar title D like, F uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title. <laughter> That's why, I, I just don't like the, yeah, it is, I, I don't like that a lot. I don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either. Yeah, yeah, that might be good, though, that might be good. Uhhuh. Uhhuh, uhhuh. I guess, I'm not fond of the action packed movie, where they're always chasing or fighting, C or, D you know, I like the more, movies that make you think. No, I haven't seen that yet, C and that's something I really should have seen. Was that good, did you see it? Uhhuh. Yeah, a friend of mine saw it C and she said it was okay, D you know, it wasn't anything spectacular. Yeah, the previews looked so good <<pause>> that I wanted to see it C but I never did, F uh. Yea, D well I saw half of it, C and I remember I was in school, I saw half of it C and I fell asleep C and everyone else watched it <laughter>. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I really need to go see the original one, I'm sure it was a good movie, I just, I probably had a test that day, or something, I don't know. Yeah. Uhhuh, yeah. I think, I think though, that movies are losing their luster. I think movies are losing their attractiveness, just to a lot of people. Just, I think, I don't know, because of the cost C and, I think it, it's just losing its originality or something. I don't, I can't pin, pinpoint it. C But it doesn't seem like it's as big, F uh, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be. Uhhuh, yeah, exactly. Right. Uhhuh. Right, right, uhhuh. Uhhuh. D Well let's start with you <laughter>. FIVE HEARTBEATS? Who, who was in that. Okay. When was it out? Uhhuh. <Throat_clearing>. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that one, that was pretty good. F Uh, that won best picture, I think. C And Costner got best director. Another Kennedy movie, F huh <laughter>. One comes to mind here C and I ca, not sure about the name, has Meryl Streep C and, F um, what was the name of that? D Anyway the ba, the premise of the story is that, F uh, F uh, F uh, you go to a pla, after you die you go to a place called Judgment City. C And, F um, D anyway, F uh, I can't remem, the other, the other actor, F uh, Yeah C and, F uh, D, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE. DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, C and it's, it's an excellent movie, F uh, it's pretty entertaining, F uh. Let's see, what else have I seen lately, F um. HOME ALONE. Okay, yeah. <Throat_clearing>. Ye, di, D well, did you ever see HOME ALONE? That was a, that was a good one, too. Yeah, it's pretty good, C and, F um. I can't believe I'm just drawing a blank, because, I've s, Uhhuh. That kind of reminds me D like, F uh, did you ever see, this is going way back, F uh, JAGGED EDGE. Tha, that was a good one too, yeah. C But, F uh. Yeah that's, F Oh, okay. Uhhuh. Yeah. I haven't seen a whole lot either, C but <throat_clearing>, I know I'm drawing a blank on what I've seen. I know it's <throat_clearing>, it's obnoxious, because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket, C but then you end up spending another six dollars on food. C And a pop, D you know, C so it's, it gets pretty, Yeah D like if I, C so if I take a date, it, it cost me, D you know, twenty bucks, easy. C And, F uh, I don't know. I was going to say, you, D you know, you can find certain restaurants that are nice, and have good food for ea, eat for thirty dollars. Yeah, the problem is you always have to wait until they're out. C So that's what you're, you're, F uh, dealing with. That's true, that is true. D Well. I ought to open the paper here because I know I've seen a few that have, have played. C But, F um, <<pause>> I just can't come up with any names here, haven't, haven't been to one for a little while, C but, F um. Did you ever see KINDERGARTEN COP? That was pretty good. Yeah, uhhuh. C But, F um. Oka, Yeah, whose in that? Uhhuh. Another one I saw is called the OBJECT OF BEAUTY. I don't re, recommend that, as much as, F uh, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, C but, it was, it was all right, kind of funny. <<pause>> F Um, C but, F um, what else has been on and about. Yeah. I'm trying to, I wanted to get to the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I hear that, F Oh, did you see that? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Huh. Yeah, I'll probably try to go se, to see it in a little while here. C But it's been out for a while. Have you heard anything on, D like, OUT FOR JUSTICE. Has he had, has he had very many other movies out? Because it's a macho movie. Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out. I don't know, I've enjoyed a lot of his movies, F uh, they just, they're action filled, and a little bit of humor, C and, F uh. <Laughter>. Yeah. Yeah, did you ever see, F um, F um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? I haven't, I haven't heard much lately. I just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews. Yeah. You expect more out of, F uh, Julia Roberts, though. Did you ever see the original F X movie. <Throat_clearing> F Oh, okay, because I was going to say I always enjoyed that, I, I, F uh, I remember that movie, C and, F uh, it was, E I mean I got in to it, C and, F uh, they have F, F X TWO out, I don't know if, Yeah, it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, F uh, I can't put it exactly on the lines of the JAGGED EDGE, C but it, D you know, kind of on that end, D you know, you get these twists C and, it's usually pretty good, C but, F uh. What's that? Yeah, yeah <throat_clearing>. That's probably true. I, I, I just you see the same story lines, different characters C and, F um, I don't know, it's, it's, it's hard to say. An, C and I know I don't, D you, know, I don't keep up with it, D you know. C But, F uh, I don't try to ju, ju, just for that reason, it is a, it does cost a lot, C so why go out and see something right away, D you know, you kind of wait C and if something gets really good reviews, maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks, D you know to go to it. C But, F um, D you know, I haven't been to a g, to an opening for, F oh, D you know ages, Just because.
