All right. I, I D like keep forgetting to make these calls. I've been on this list for two months. I think I've made four calls <laughter>. Right. D Well there are some kind of nice prizes, C and it's worth doing it. I so mad I think I've had this for two months C and, D like I've said, I've made four calls, C and lot of times we don't answer the phone, probably when I get mine early in the evening <laughter>. D Well, we're supposed to talk about movies. Have you been to any lately? F Uh, I haven't really seen one since probably August because, F uh, every weekend in, in the Fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after, C and that's kind of the our social for the, C But, F oh, I saw, F uh, ROBIN HOOD, which I didn't care for. No, C and my husband dragged me to it. I D like, I think Kevin Costner's a nice fellow, C and he's nice looking, C but he just, to me, is not a very dynamic actor. <Laughter> I guess because he is good looking. I don't know <laughter>. I don't know <laughter>. Oh. I saw CITY SLICKERS. Did you see, that was a, That's the last one I saw, I think. I did too. I thought that was so cute, C and. F Oh, I do too. F Oh, I, I really enjoyed that. Right. Which most of them probably aren't <laughter>. I don't know what my kids see any more. My kids are twenty and sixteen, C so they've probably seen about everything at this point <laughter>. Oh. Uhhuh. <Laughter> F Oh, I know it. That's the way it is. We can see some pretty raunchy stuff on, on just regular T V without cable or anything. D You know there's no way to protect them any more. D So. No, <laughter> it'll teach a great lesson, because she ended up so, in so <laughter>. C But it was a fun movie to watch. F Oh, the scary one? F Oh, I didn't see that, C but the, F Oh, really. F Oh, I like scary ones that are realistic. <Laughter> They say is really frightening, too. , the new one that came out. They say it's really horrifyingly scary C but, F uh, I'd never get my husband to that. He doesn't like to be scared <laughter>. F Oh, C and my kids both saw that. They liked it. C And it was still scary? F Oh, no. Gosh. F Oh, no, that one sounded gross, I know my husband wouldn't have stood for that. He, he likes MARY POPPINS and things <laughter>. Yeah <laughter>. I do too, I, I really like a variety. Where are you from? F Oh, I was going to s, D well my husband's from New Jersey, C and we lived there for five years when we first got married C and so, it sound kind of nice, it was familiar <laughter> your accent. Oh. Right. I don't know up there. Just, F uh, different, uhhuh. D Well, D see the accents up there fascinated me, because even in his family alone, there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently. C And, C and his family, they lived in the same house there, most of them were twenty or so <laughter> D you know. Yeah uhhuh, C and they lived, D you know, they never moved into apartments when they were young, they always stayed at home until they got married, it seemed to be the custom up there. C Or they went in the service, C and so they were together for all that time <laughter>. C But they still, their accents differed a little in the family C so, C and it. F Uh, in the sixties. I finally. F Oh, yeah. I converted him to being a Texan. I, I just thought life would be, I knew it was easier back here. D Well, sort of. I'm an Air Force brat, C but I was real familiar with Texas. I went to college here and everything. C And I just thought, D you know, we could probably get a better house, C and life is a little slower, a little easier. He loves it. He, he really, would never want to leave, C so it worked out. Not hard when you first came. Was it hard when you first came? F Oh, my. F Oh, I know, F Oh, compared to New York, F oh, yes. Were you all transferred? F Um. I have a friend down the street's from New Jersey C and they were, he got a, F Oh, really, I just, F Oh, I just got mine last week, C and I haven't started yet because I wanted to get one first see how it worked. Really. Yeah. I have, I was trying to think of the one I went to a couple of weeks ago, C but I forgot it already. Oh. That's your weekend. Yeah really. Really. I didn't see that, because I didn't think I would care for it. Oh. Yeah, I think that's why a lot of people go to see him, though <laughter>. Right <laughter>. Yes I did see that C and I really enjoyed that. Yeah. I thought that was appropriate just for everyone. Yeah. It was great. Yeah, C and my daughter went to see that one too. C So, it was fine for her C so, yeah. Right, D well that's right. Probably they have. D Well, my daughter is twelve C and we had a sleep over one night. They wanted to watch PRETTY WOMAN, which I have C and I was hesitant, C and they all had seen it anyway. all twelve, C so. Yes, they do yes, they do. Right, C but, I, I love Julia Roberts movies, C but I didn't think they were great for my daughter <laughter>. No. Really, really. F Oh, I love PRETTY WOMAN, C and then I like that one after that where, F oh, what was it? It was like a FATAL ATTRACTION thing. Yeah. I don't remember the name of it C but that was so good. That was really excellent. Yeah, that, that was, <laughter> that was. What was? F Oh, I don't know. Really. Oh. The last scary thing I saw was MISERY. That scared me to death, C and I watched it at a friend's house on video C and I was just. F Oh, yes. It was horrible. It was so awful. Really. I like that, too. I like funny movies C and I like scary movies. Yeah. I'm from New York. Is he really. Oh. Yeah, yes, it's so close, I'm from Long Island C so that's close, D you know, that's more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester, New York, those, that kind of thing. Yeah, different, it's it's different, yeah, I guess. Oh. Really. Really, C and they were all from New Jersey. F Um. Really. F Um. When did you live there? F Oh, yeah. I was in New York in the sixties. Are you from Texas? F Oh, yeah, F Oh, yeah. It is, it is, yeah. I'm used to it now. C So, I like. F Um? F Oh, yes it was.
