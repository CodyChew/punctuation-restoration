Yes, just this last summer we went back to Utah, C and we met, it was my, we usually go to my family reunion, C but this one was my husband's C and they're usually quite similar, I think. No, he's from here C but, F uh, most of his people are from Oregon, C so we kind of met halfway C and so, this was one, C and they, F um, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, D you know, things like that have to be planned, D like they had planned that, we went to the reunion in end of Jul, June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend, C but we had to plan everything D like clear in December, January to reserve that. Uhhuh. No this was everybody. F Oh, I, F oh, I, jeez, I think over, F um, three hundred were there. It was quite a large it was a great big lodge, C and so we had plenty of room and everything, C and some of them live in that area, C so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave. C But, F um, that was a great big thing, C and we do that with his family about every five years, a great big one. C And then D like immediate family we do, D like we try to do one thing once a year. D Well, he has eight brothers and sisters C so that's big by itself. <Laughter>. Yeah. C So we have a little shindig with them. F Um they're close, in a close proximity. F Um, let's see, there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad. C So, F um, the others live in close neighboring, F um, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that, yeah C so, it's been fun. How about you? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. That's hard. Yeah, Yeah. Uhhuh. Yeah. It really is fun, C and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said once a year, F um, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing. You can come and go as you please type thing. C And they do that once a year. I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad, C but you can't go every year, you just cannot do that. F Um. F Um, basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters. There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out. Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them, D like I go stay with my mother, C and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, D you know kind of thing. C And so it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area C so that's not hard, C but the real planning, that's the real key C and they send out, my mom's family now, this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with, C but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year, C and that's how they divide it up C and then, F Um, she has ten in that family C and each one of them take their turn. C And then the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is her children help her, D like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing. Yeah, C and, F um, the thing is, that, F um, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out, C and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making, Hi, Clarice. F Um, have you had a family reunion recently? Uhhuh. Are you both from Utah originally? F Oh, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, how nice. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Sure, sure, D Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles like that or his immediate family? F Oh, wow. F Oh wow, how many people were there? Wow. Wow. Uhhuh. F Oh that's, wonderful, F oh. D Now how many, how many people are in his immediate family? F Oh, wow. Wow, it really is, C and you get together once a year. Wow, Are they all here in the area, C or are they scattered? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh wow, that's wonderful. D Well, we don't really get together, I, I would love to, C and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime. F Um, I have a sister in Colorado, and, F uh, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas. C So we're kind of scattered right now. C And, F uh, my, my cousins have a, D you know, they put on a family reunion, F um, once a year, C but it's always like the second week in September, C so it's, the kids are already back in school C and so, C and that's back in the C and that's in New York, C and there's no way, E I mean there's just no possible way. C And it's not really a weekend, it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, D you know, F um, my family moved to Connecticut, the rest of the family stayed in New York and, F uh, on Long Island, C and so, they're all kind of local and close, C and so they just have a, D you know, a day picnic, C and, F uh, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing that would be so wonderful <laughter>. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. C And do they, they have a hotel, C or where do you stay? Take everybody, yeah. Uhhuh, uhhuh. Yeah, yeah, F Oh, that sounds so wonderful, isn't that nice. Yeah. Uhhuh. C But then one brother and sister from each family. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow, uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, I see, uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. F Oh, wow,
