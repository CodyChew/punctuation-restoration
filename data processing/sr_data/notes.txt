Here are some properties of the sr data files I have found after some inspection.

1. full UTT dataset contains 1155 files (swXXXXX format)
2. train and dev come from same UTT files (742 swXXXXX files)
3. 392 of the 742 are found in the 1155 files
4. there are 350 sw files in the train/dev set which are not found in the downloadable UTT files online
5. there are no overlapping files between train and test set
6. test set contains full texts from swXXXXX files, 761 files, all swX3XXX and swX4XXX taken up by test set, all test sets can be found in UTT files
7. 2 files sw02289 and sw04379 (in the 1155 files) are in neither train or test sets
8. dev set is a subset of the segments in train set
